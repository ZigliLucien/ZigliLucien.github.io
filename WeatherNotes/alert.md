   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued March 18 at 2:25AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">The combination of very dry air and northwest winds gusting up to
      20 mph will create an elevated risk of uncontrolled fire spread
      this afternoon. Relative humidity values will fall to 20 to 35%,
      with the lowest humidity levels over the Ozark Foothills of
      southeast Missouri.
      
      A more substantial fire danger is expected Tuesday, as southwest
      winds increase significantly, with gusts of 25 to 40 mph forecast
      Tuesday afternoon. Relative humidity values Tuesday afternoon
      will fall to 25 to 35%.
      
      If you are planning outdoor burning today and Tuesday, use extra
      caution and have fire suppression equipment ready.
      
      Tonight, very cold and dry surface high pressure will allow
      temperatures to drop into the middle and upper 20s throughout the
      region.
      
      Although the growing season has not officially started, tender
      vegetation could be impacted by these cold temperatures. Please
      take necessary actions to protect any tender vegetation tonight.
