   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
      
      * WHERE...The entire Quad State region.
      
      * WHEN...From 1 AM CDT  /2 AM EDT/ Sunday through Monday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Strong to severe thunderstorms will be capable of producing
      heavy rainfall in multiple rounds of expected storm activity.
      Any such storm may bring flooding rains, especially if they
      repeat over the same areas. This threat will be heightened
      for some of our localities that have seen such localized
      heavy rainfall over the past few days, where their threshold
      for flooding will be more sensitive.
