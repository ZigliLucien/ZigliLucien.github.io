   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued February 10 at 2:02AM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Light snow will move through parts of the region late tonight
      through Tuesday morning, mainly along and north of the Ohio River
      and in adjacent portions of southeast Missouri. Snowfall
      accumulations of roughly half an inch to as much one and a half
      inches are possible in this area. Locally greater totals closer to
      2 inches are also possible where snow banding occurs.
      
      Warm ground temperatures will limit snow accumulation on roads,
      but a few slippery spots may develop on untreated roads and
      bridges, especially during the Tuesday morning commute. Stay tuned
      for updates to the forecast through this afternoon.
