      fallen below freezing and are expected to drop into the teens to
      around 20 degrees by Tuesday morning. Lingering moisture on area
      roads will lead to icy patches, especially on bridges and

   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued December 2 at 5:27PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Light snow lingering this evening should exit all of the forecast
      area by 8 PM. While most of the accumulation has been confined to
      grassy and elevated surfaces, there have been numerous reports of
      slick roads causing accidents across the region. With air
      temperatures below freezing now, the potential for black ice will
      continue into the evening hours. Even once the snow ends, some
      scattered slick spots may remain.
      
      Please use caution if travelling this evening, slow down, and
      leave extra time to reach your destination.
