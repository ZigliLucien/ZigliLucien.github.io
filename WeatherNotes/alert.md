   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued March 19 at 3:17AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Very cold and dry surface high pressure have allowed temperatures
      to drop into the middle 20s throughout the Quad State early this
      morning. Some more sheltered areas could even drop into the lower
      20s. Although the growing season has not officially started,
      tender vegetation could be impacted by these cold temperatures.
      
      Southwest winds will increase significantly later this morning,
      with gusts of 25 to 35 mph forecast in the afternoon. Along with
      relative humidity values falling into the 20 to 30 percent range,
      these gusty winds will create an elevated fire danger throughout
      the Quad State. If you are planning outdoor burning today, use
      extra caution and have fire suppression equipment ready.
