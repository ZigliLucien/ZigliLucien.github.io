   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued March 17 at 3:42PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Very cold and dry surface high pressure will surge through the
      region bringing sub-freezing temperatures to the entire Quad State
      tonight and Monday night. Temperatures may drop into the middle
      20s resulting in a hard freeze over the northern half of the
      region tonight, especially over southern Illinois. Temperatures
      Monday night are expected to drop into the middle and upper 20s
      throughout the Quad State, potentially leading to another hard
      freeze.
      
      Although the growing season has not officially started, some
      tender vegetation could be impacted by these cold temperatures.
      Please take necessary actions to protect any tender vegetation
      the next two nights.
