      with visibilities briefly dropping below 1/4 mile at times.
      
      A frontal boundary is sagging south through the area, which will
      allow most of the fog to mix out around or a couple hours after
      midnight.
      
      Use low-beam headlights and allow extra time to reach your
      destination.
