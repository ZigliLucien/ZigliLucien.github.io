      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - While there will be a brief break in the rainfall through
      late evening, additional thunderstorms are expected
      overnight. Recent heavy rainfall has primed soils for quicker
      runoff and faster flood development. The additional round of
      rain through tonight may produce flash flooding, as well as
      flooding of small creeks, streams, low water crossings, and
      urban areas.
