   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued February 12 at 4:53AM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Light rain is expected to move into the area this morning around
      sunrise, then linger through early this evening. Temperatures will
      hover near freezing through noon, which may allow for a light
      glaze to develop on elevated surfaces such as untreated bridges
      and overpasses. Temperatures are expected to warm above freezing
      this afternoon, which will allow any ice accumulation to melt off.
      
      If traveling this morning, allow extra time to reach your
      destination and be prepared for sudden changes in road conditions.
