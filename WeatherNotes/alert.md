   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued February 20 at 2:17PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Very cold temperatures in the single digits, even near zero
      degrees, are forecast tonight. This means any lingering moisture
      on roadways will refreeze. Other protective cold measures will be
      needed one more night, like protecting your pipes from freezing.
      Be especially cautious if traveling, especially over bridges,
      overpasses, or on secondary roads. Even main highways that look
      clear might have patches of black ice redevelop. Finally, it's
      getting alot drier, but lingering snow cover might help induce a
      little overnight fog. If that occurs, that's another moisture
      source for freezing and creating slick spots on area roads and
      walkways...so exercise caution.
