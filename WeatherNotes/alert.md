      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Additional thunderstorms with high rain rates are moving
      through northern portions of the Quad State. With recent
      heavy rainfall priming soils for quicker runoff and faster
      flood development, the flood watch is extended to account for
      these storms. Flooding of small creeks, streams, and urban
      areas is possible.
