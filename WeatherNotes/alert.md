   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued August 16 at 12:18PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">With increasing sunshine comes increasing temperatures, and the
      still humid air mass will combine with that to create some
      uncomfortable heat index readings. The heat index will reach near
      or even into the triple digits, with the most stifling readings
      over southeast Missouri and adjacent locales.
      
      Use caution if planning to be outdoors for extended periods of
      time. Take frequent breaks, drink plenty of water, and wear light
      colored clothing.

   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued August 16 at 3:21AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Triple digit heat index values are expected again this afternoon
      over southeast Missouri, the Purchase Area of Kentucky, and
      adjacent portions of southern Illinois. The worst conditions are
      expected over the Ozark Foothills, where readings could reach 110
      degrees. Farther to the northeast heat index values are expected
      to range from 95 to 100 degrees, but triple digit readings will be
      possible throughout the region. A Heat Advisory may eventually be
      issued for a portion of the region if confidence improves.
      
      Use caution if planning to be outdoors for extended periods of
      time. Take frequent breaks, drink plenty of water, and wear light
      colored clothing.
