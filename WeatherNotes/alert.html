   <h2>Flood Watch issued July 4 at 12:40PM CDT until July 5 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southeast Missouri, southern Illinois,
      southwest Indiana, and northwest Kentucky.
      
      * WHEN...Through late tonight.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Additional thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and
      tonight. Recent heavy rainfall has primed soils for faster
      flood development. The additional round of rain through
      tonight may produce flash flooding, as well as flooding of
      small creeks, streams, low water crossings, and urban areas.
