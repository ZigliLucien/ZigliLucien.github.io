   <h2>Ice Storm Warning issued January 5 at 1:59PM CST until January 6 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Significant icing expected through the early evening with a
      mix of sleet and freezing rain. Winds gusting to 30 mph. A period
      of freezing drizzle is likely tonight before precipitation changes
      to snow late night through Monday morning. Additional snow and
      sleet accumulations up to two inches and additional ice
      accumulations up to a quarter inch with locally higher amounts.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, western Kentucky, and
      southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...Until noon CST Monday.
      
      * IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
      become slick and hazardous. Significant ice accumulation on power
      lines and tree limbs may cause widespread and long-lasting power
      outages. Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice.
      Travel could be nearly impossible.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An arctic blast will arrive Monday and last
      through most of the week. Wind chill values will drop into the
      single digits or below zero at times, which can be even more
      dangerous with any long duration power outages.
