      * WHEN...Through Monday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches occurred this
      morning, particularly focused across southeast Missouri,
      western Kentucky, and far southern Illinois. Localized higher
      amounts up to 5 inches were observed. Another round of very
      heavy rain is expected with severe thunderstorms through this
      evening. This likely will lead to additional rainfall amounts
      of 1 to 3 inches, with localized higher amounts possible.
      This will lead to a heightened flash flooding concern,
      especially in those areas that already received flooding this
      morning. Significant flash flooding is possible in some of
      these locations this evening.
