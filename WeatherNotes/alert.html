   <h2>Ice Storm Warning issued January 4 at 1:31PM CST until January 6 at 6:00AM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Significant icing expected. Total snow and sleet
      accumulations up to two inches and ice accumulations between one
      quarter and three quarters of an inch.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, western Kentucky, and
      southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...From 2 AM Sunday to 6 AM CST Monday.
      
      * IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
      likely become slick and hazardous. Significant ice accumulation on
      power lines and tree limbs may cause widespread and long-lasting
      power outages. Expect power outages and tree damage due to the
      ice. Travel could be impossible.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An arctic blast will arrive Monday and last
      through most of the week. Wind chill values will drop into the
      single digits or below zero at times, which can be even more
      dangerous with any long duration power outages.
