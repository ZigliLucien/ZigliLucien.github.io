   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued November 29 at 1:26PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">A narrow swath of 1 to 2 inches of accumulating snowfall is
      possible along and near the I-64 corridor through southern
      Illinois and into southwest Indiana. The best chance will be north
      of the interstate, where locally higher amounts may occur.
      
      The best chance of accumulating snowfall will be during the
      afternoon and early evening, when temperatures of the air and
      ground are both above freezing. This might inhibit higher totals
      from being realized.
      
      The event winds down overnight, when temperatures will fall into
      the 20s. Any lingering light snow or snow that falls on the ground
      during the overnight hours could produce a few slick spots as the
      temperature falls below freezing then.
      
      Holiday weekend travelers are advised to allow a little extra time
      and drive carefully should slick road conditions come into play
      Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. Also, stay abreast of the
      latest updates and forecasts for any changes to this evolving
      weather system.
