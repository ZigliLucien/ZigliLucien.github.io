   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 4 and
      7 inches with locally higher amounts possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois and southwest Indiana south
      of I-64, and the entirety of western Kentucky.
      
      * WHEN...From noon today to 9 AM CST Wednesday.
      
      * IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
      become slick and hazardous. Travel will be very difficult. The
      hazardous conditions could impact the commutes this evening and
      Wednesday morning.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Light snow is possible through early this
      morning which may bring accumulations up to an inch along and
      north of a line across IL-13 to far northwest Kentucky, producing

      to occur near sunset through the overnight hours. Dangerous cold
      temperatures will follow after snow ends. Low temperatures well
      below normal with overnight winds will cause wind chills to fall

      impacts from the extreme cold will occur Thursday morning with
      wind chills around -5 to -10 areawide.
