   <h2>Flood Watch issued July 16 at 8:53PM CDT until July 17 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, including the following
      counties, Franklin, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Perry IL, Union
      and Williamson and southeast Missouri, including the following
      counties, Bollinger, Cape Girardeau, Carter, Perry MO, Ripley and
      Wayne MO.
      
      * WHEN...Until 7 AM CDT Wednesday.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - The potential for flooding is highly contingent on whether
      thunderstorms develop overnight. If that occurs, conditions
      will be favorable for slow moving thunderstorms that produce
      heavy rainfall, which could lead to localized flash flooding.
