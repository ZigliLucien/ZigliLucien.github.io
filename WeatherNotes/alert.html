   <h2>Flood Watch issued May 26 at 3:17AM CDT until May 27 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...All of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, west
      Kentucky, and southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...Through early Monday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms with very
      heavy rainfall are expected to traverse the region through

      intense in areas that receive multiple rounds of heavy
      rainfall, and especially in areas that have received heavy
      rainfall in the last few days.
