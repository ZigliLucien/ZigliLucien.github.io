   <h2>Flood Watch issued July 4 at 2:41AM CDT until July 5 at 1:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southwest Illinois and southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...Through late tonight.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Thunderstorms will move through this morning, with a possible
      round of storms developing late afternoon, and a final round
      of storms Thursday night. Recent heavy rains have occurred,
      priming soils for faster flood development. The multiple
      rounds of heavy rain may produce flash flooding, as well as
      flood small creeks, streams, low water crossings, and urban
      areas.
