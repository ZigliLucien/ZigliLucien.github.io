   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued December 2 at 5:27PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Light snow lingering this evening should exit all of the forecast
      area by 8 PM. While most of the accumulation has been confined to
      grassy and elevated surfaces, there have been numerous reports of
      slick roads causing accidents across the region. With air
      temperatures below freezing now, the potential for black ice will
      continue into the evening hours. Even once the snow ends, some
      scattered slick spots may remain.
      
      Please use caution if travelling this evening, slow down, and
      leave extra time to reach your destination.
   </div>

   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued December 2 at 3:48PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Light to moderate snow will continue to impact the region late
      this afternoon before exiting the region early this evening.
      Accumulations will range from a dusting to half an inch in many
      locations. However, localized amounts up to 1 inch are possible.
      
      Most of the accumulations will be confined to grassy and elevated
      surfaces, but some slush may accumulate on a few untreated roads
      especially as we approach sunset and thereafter.
      
      Allow a little extra time and drive carefully on your evening
      commute today.
