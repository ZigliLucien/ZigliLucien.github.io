   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued March 18 at 3:31PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Very cold and dry surface high pressure will allow temperatures
      to drop into the middle and upper 20s throughout the Quad State
      tonight. Some more sheltered areas could even drop into the lower
      20s.
      
      Although the growing season has not officially started, tender
      vegetation could be impacted by these cold temperatures. Please
      take necessary actions to protect any tender vegetation tonight.
      
      Southwest winds will increase significantly Tuesday morning, with
      gusts of 25 to 40 mph forecast in the afternoon. Along with
      relative humidity values falling into the 25 to 30 percent range,
      these gusty winds will create an elevated fire danger throughout
      the Quad State.
      
      If you are planning outdoor burning Tuesday, use extra caution
      and have fire suppression equipment ready.
