   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued August 27 at 6:02PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">High temperatures will peak in the mid to upper 90s each afternoon
      through Thursday, with a few locations possibly touching 100.
      While humidity levels are expected to remain relatively low by
      late August standards, heat index readings will still peak in the
      upper 90s to just above 100 each afternoon. A few heat index
      readings near 105 are possible Wednesday afternoon, mainly focused
      near the Perryville, Missouri to Mount Vernon, Illinois corridor.
      Be sure to use caution if planning to be outdoors for long
      stretches. Drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks, and wear
      light colored and loose fitting clothing.
