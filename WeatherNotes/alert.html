   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued April 7 at 12:52PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Thunderstorms are expected to develop through early afternoon
      mainly west of the Mississippi River and work eastward through the
      day. With a large number of visitors in the area for tomorrows
      eclipse, and many of those camping outdoors, be advised to remain
      alert for changing weather conditions. A reminder, if you can
      hear thunder you are close enough to be struck by lightning.
      
      Some of these storms may become severe with a risk for large hail,
      damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes. Monitor for later updates
      and possible severe weather warnings this afternoon and be
      prepared to seek shelter if threatening weather approaches.
