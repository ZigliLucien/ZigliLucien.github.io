   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued June 16 at 3:48AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">The combination of very warm temperatures along with increasing
      relative humidity today will result in uncomfortably hot
      temperatures across the region. Heat index values are expected to
      range between 100 and 105 degrees this afternoon into the early
      evening hours.
      
      If working outside today, be sure to drink plenty of water, wear
      loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, and take frequent breaks
      in air-conditioned locations. Be sure to check on those most
      vulnerable to heat, including children and the elderly, provide
      shade and fresh water for outdoor pets and livestock, and check
      the backseat of your vehicle when transporting children.
