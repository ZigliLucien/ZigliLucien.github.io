   <h2>Flood Watch issued July 4 at 6:57PM CDT until July 5 at 5:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, including the following
      areas, Edwards, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson,
      Perry IL, Saline, Wabash, Wayne IL, White and Williamson,
      southwest Indiana, including the following areas, Gibson, Pike,
      Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick, western Kentucky,
      including the following areas, Daviess, Henderson and Union KY,
      and southeast Missouri, including the following areas, Bollinger,
      Butler, Cape Girardeau, Carter, Perry MO, Ripley and Wayne MO.
      
      * WHEN...Until 5 AM CDT /6 AM EDT/ Friday.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - While there will be a brief break in the rainfall through
      late evening, additional thunderstorms are expected
      overnight. Recent heavy rainfall has primed soils for quicker
      runoff and faster flood development. The additional round of
      rain through tonight may produce flash flooding, as well as
      flooding of small creeks, streams, low water crossings, and
      urban areas.
