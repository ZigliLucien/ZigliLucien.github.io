   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued February 18 at 12:44AM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Bands of light to occasionally moderate snow ahead of the main
      winter storm will move through mainly the northern half of the
      Quad State region during the overnight hours through early this
      morning. This snow will produce light accumulations ranging from a
      dusting up to around one inch. While widespread travel impacts
      are not expected, isolated slippery spots are possible, especially
      on less traveled back roads. If driving during the overnight to
      early morning hours, use extra caution if you encounter snow
      accumulation on the roads.
