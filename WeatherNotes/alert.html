   <h2>Flood Watch issued July 5 at 4:49AM CDT until July 5 at 8:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, including the following
      areas, Edwards, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson,
      Perry IL, Saline, Wabash, Wayne IL, White and Williamson,
      southwest Indiana, including the following areas, Gibson, Pike,
      Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick, and western Kentucky,
      including the following areas, Daviess, Henderson and Union KY.
      
      * WHEN...Until 8 AM CDT /9 AM EDT/ this morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Additional thunderstorms with high rain rates are moving
      through northern portions of the Quad State. With recent
      heavy rainfall priming soils for quicker runoff and faster
      flood development, the flood watch is extended to account for
      these storms. Flooding of small creeks, streams, and urban
      areas is possible.
