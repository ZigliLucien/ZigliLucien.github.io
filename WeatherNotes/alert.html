   <h2>Ice Storm Warning issued January 6 at 2:02AM CST until January 6 at 12:00PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Additional snow accumulations up to one inch and ice
      accumulations around a light glaze.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, western Kentucky, and
      southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...Until noon CST today.
      
      * IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will
      remain slick and hazardous. Significant ice accumulation on power
      lines and tree limbs may lead to additional power outages due to
      wind gusts up to 30 mph. Plan on slippery road conditions. The
      hazardous conditions will impact the morning commute.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An arctic blast will arrive Monday and last
      through most of the week. Wind chill values will drop into the
      single digits or below zero at times, which can be even more
      dangerous with any long duration power outages.
