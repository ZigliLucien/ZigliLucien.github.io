Researchers, including UConn Department of Natural Resources and the Environment Assistant Professor James Knighton, Pablo Sanchez-Martinez from the University of Edinburgh, and Leander Anderegg from the University of California Santa Barbara, have developed a method to bypass the need for gathering data for over 55,000 tree species to better account for how plants influence the flow of water around the planet.

CITES is the main agreement that regulates international wildlife trade, which is critical to ensuring that trade does not damage the status of wild populations of plants and animals. The year 2025 marks 50 years since CITES was founded, yet new research has found that it is failing to adequately deter the illegal extraction and trade of many species. The researchers propose a new framework for CITES, the use of which could make the Convention more effective. This framework supports sustainability by deeply analyzing wildlife trade systems and ensuring that CITES trade measures fit within wider supply chain structures. It also ensures these trade systems are fair and recognized by those involved.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
