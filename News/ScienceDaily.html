Researchers analyzed over 40 years of climate conditions that impact the growth cycle of apple trees from bud break and flowering through fruit development, maturation and color development. While many growing areas are facing increased climate risks, the top three largest apple producing counties in the U.S. were among the most impacted: Yakima in Washington, Kent in Michigan and Wayne in New York. In particular, Yakima County, the largest of the three with more than 48,800 acres of apple orchards, has seen harmful trends in five of the six metrics the researchers analyzed.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Their findings show that the risk of blood cancer associated with the use of clozapine is very low, with an average increase of less than six cases per 10,000 persons using clozapine for one year. Therefore, the clinical significance of such a risk is plausibly low. While previous preliminary Western studies have shown a potentially significant increase in risk, this study suggests that with stringent blood monitoring measures before and during clozapine use in Hong Kong and around the world, it may not be necessary to further restrict the use of clozapine or issue special warnings by the Department of Health or local drug regulatory authorities, thus facilitating early and effective treatment of mental illness.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
