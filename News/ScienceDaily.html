While previous preliminary Western studies have shown a potentially significant increase in risk, this study suggests that with stringent blood monitoring measures before and during clozapine use in Hong Kong and around the world, it may not be necessary to further restrict the use of clozapine or issue special warnings by the Department of Health or local drug regulatory authorities, thus facilitating early and effective treatment of mental illness.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
