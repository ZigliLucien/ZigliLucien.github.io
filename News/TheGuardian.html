The extraordinary efforts of Nihon Hidankyo and other representatives of the Hibakusha have contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo.</p><p>It is therefore alarming that today this taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure. The nuclear powers are modernising and upgrading their arsenals; new countries appear to be preparing to acquire nuclear weapons; and threats are being made to use nuclear weapons in ongoing warfare.</p><p>At this moment in human history, it is worth reminding ourselves what nuclear weapons are: the most destructive weapons the world has ever seen.</p><p>the only nation-wide organization of A-bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Hibakusha).

The total number of the surviving Hibakusha living in Japan is 174,080, as of March 2016. There are several thousands of more Hibakusha living in Korea and other parts of the world outside Japan. HIDANKYO is cooperating with those organizations in their work for the defense of the living and rights of these people.</p><p>1) The prevention of nuclear war and the elimination of nuclear weapons, including the signing of an international agreement for a total ban and the elimination of nuclear weapons. The convening of an international conference to reach this goal is also part of Hidankyo’s basic demand;</p><p>2) State compensation for the A-bomb damages. The state responsibility of having launched the war, which led to the damage by the atomic bombing, should be acknowledged, and the state compensation provided.</p><p>3) Improvement of the current policies and measures on the protection and assistance for the Hibakusha.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/nobel-peace-prize-2024-winner-live-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

You can read our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/trump-aurora-colorado-migrant-crackdown">latest story here</a></p><p><strong>As he wrapped up his remarks, Walz took a swing at Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint to remake the US government authored by people in Donald Trump’s orbit.</strong></p><p>“I’ve also, at times, said Donald Trump doesn’t have a plan – concept of a plan, at times. That wasn’t exactly correct. He does have a plan. It’s called Project 2025,” Walz said.</p><p>This thing is a damn nightmare. His project 2025 would repeal the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act – that would threaten hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs, including those right here in Michigan. The ones that JD Vance said, those 650 jobs were table scraps, good-paying union jobs building America, and those are table scraps. He would establish, and every single economist said so, a national sales tax on everything from groceries to prescription drugs.</p><p>And the estimates is it would cost each and every one of you $4,000 he says those tariffs that Trump will pay, or that China will pay, Trump’s tariffs – you’re going to pay them. That’s the way it always works.</p><p>Let me tell you exactly what vice-president Harris and I will do. We’re going to create an American forward strategy for manufacturing, one that builds on the historic investments, bipartisan infrastructure, law, Chips act, science act, Inflation Reduction Act, creating all kinds of new opportunities, ones that empowers American workers, revitalizes manufacturing communities, leads us into an industries of the future and keep out innovating and out competing the rest of the world.</p><p>We never fear the future. You build the future, and this gives us the opportunity to do it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/11/trump-harris-us-elections-obama-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
