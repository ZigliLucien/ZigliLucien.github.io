The DoJ warned Louisiana officials last year that the state could face a lawsuit if it didn’t fix the problems – but lawyers for the department say the state’s “marginal efforts” to address the issues were “inadequate” and showed a “deliberate indifference” to the constitutional rights of incarcerated individuals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/22/louisiana-prisons-doj-lawsuit">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
