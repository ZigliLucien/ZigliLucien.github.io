When he tried to overturn the 2020 election, the January 6th Committee stood in defense of our democracy. Threats to jail us will not deter us. Nothing will stop me from doing my duty to the American people.</p><p>This morning, President-elect Trump again lied about the January 6th Select Committee, and said members of the Committee ‘should go to jail’ for carrying out our constitutional responsibilities. Here is the truth: Donald Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and seize power. He mobilized an angry mob and sent them to the United States Capitol, where they attacked police officers, invaded the building, and halted the official counting of electoral votes. Trump watched on television as police officers were brutally beaten and the Capitol was assaulted, refusing for hours to tell the mob to leave. This was the worst breach of our Constitution by any president in our nation’s history. Donald Trump’s suggestion that members of Congress who later investigated his illegal and unconstitutional actions should be jailed is a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.</p><p>Donald Trump knows his claims about the select committee are ridiculous and false, as has been detailed extensively, including by Chairman Thompson in this July 2023 letter. There is no conceivably appropriate factual or constitutional basis for what Donald Trump is suggesting – a Justice Department investigation of the work of a congressional committee – and any lawyer who attempts to pursue that course would quickly find themselves engaged in sanctionable conduct.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/09/trump-biden-congress-politics-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Lake-effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region, and happens when cold air originating from Canada passes over the relatively warm waters of the lakes, causing the layer of air near to the surface to absorb heat and moisture. Warmer than the air above it, this layer of air then starts to rise, cooling and condensing into clouds which deposit snow on the windward side of the lakes.</p><p>In this particular event, an area of low pressure centred across eastern Canada dragged very cold Arctic air in from the north and plunged it into the north-east of the US. The dry, arctic air blew in from the north-west across the relatively warmer Lake Erie through Thanksgiving, picked up moisture and deposited snow across areas to the south and east of the lake. A dominant band of snow brought rates of 2.5cm to 7.6cm (1in to 3in) an hour to the Erie and Crawford counties. Within the first 12 hours, approximately 30cm of snow fell in Ashtabula County, Ohio, and by Saturday morning, there were reports of more than 90cm of snow in the far north-east of Ohio and north-west of Pennsylvania. As a result of this heavy snowfall, parts of the Interstate 86 and 90 were shut on Friday 29 November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/09/weather-tracker-us-winter-lake-effect-snow-north-east">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
