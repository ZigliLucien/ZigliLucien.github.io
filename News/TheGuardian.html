Yesterday, <strong>Donald Trump </strong>had the day off from his trial in New York City on charges related to falsifying business records, and held a rally in Wisconsin, a swing state crucial to his presidential election chances. After a speech spent attacking <strong>Joe Biden</strong> over his handling of border security and inflation, Trump gave <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/01/economy-and-immigration-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-wisconsin-rally/73501778007/">an interview</a> to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in which he falsely insisted that he won Wisconsin in 2020 (he did not) and “other locations”, and refused to commit to accepting the results of this year’s vote. “If everything’s honest, I’ll gladly accept the results. I don’t change on that. If it’s not, you have to fight for the right of the country,” the former president said. The comments were yet another indication that Americans should be prepared for a rocky election aftermath, should Trump lose in November to Biden. After the Democrat defeated him in 2020, Trump spent weeks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/trump-indictment-full-text-2020-election-jan-6">attempting various plots</a> to prevent Biden from taking power, culminating in the attack on the Capitol on January 6.
