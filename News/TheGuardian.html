Another strike with guided aerial bombs destroyed a hospital in the border town of Vovchansk.</p><p><strong>In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Russian missiles killed four people, including a girl aged 10, and injured seven more</strong>, the governor, Oleg Kiper, said on Telegram. Ukraine’s energy ministry said two facilities in the south had been targeted in strikes during the night, causing power outages in two regions.</p><p><strong>In Russia, a Ukrainian drone attack on Wednesday killed three people, including two children</strong>, in the Kursk border region, the local governor said. The drone fired a rocket at a civilian car in a village in Korenevski district, the governor, Roman Starovoyt, said on Telegram.</p><p><strong>Blasts were reported in Ukraine’s north-eastern, southern and western regions on Thursday morning.</strong> Explosions were heard in the city of Kharkiv, its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said on Telegram, as well as in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to its governor, Ivan Fedorov. The governor of the Lviv region, Maksim Kozytskyi, said on Telegram that air defences were working in the area.</p><p><strong>The top US general in Europe has told Congress Ukraine will be outgunned 10 to one by Russia within a matter of weeks if more ammunition and weapons are not sent to Kyiv soon.</strong> “The Russians fire five times as many artillery shells at the Ukrainians than the Ukrainians are able to fire back.
