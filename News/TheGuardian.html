And South Australia industry alone has got more than enough work on its hands for me to be able to say, as a premier, <strong>[it’s] time to sort of abandon the parochial nature of industrial policy we see between states around defence and instead invite everyone to lift their eyes and look what is important for the national effort in this regard.</strong></p><p>We know that building nuclear submarines is going to take a national enterprise and a national effort, but our ambitions to be able to build these submarines domestically requires a supply chain and an industry that are capable of delivering the parts that are required.</p><p>Now, in order to be able to do that, I think as a first big step – we’ve got to see if we can’t participate in the nuclear submarine supply chain in advance of the … Aukus submarines construction commencing later this decade. So, <strong>what we’ve negotiated with [HII], that builds the Virginia class submarines, is an opportunity for South Australian suppliers to supply to the Virginia class program.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/may/27/australia-news-live-qatar-flight-turbulence-doha-singapore-dublin-png-landslide-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-liberal-coalition-icc-asbestos-milperra">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
