 The premier, <strong>Steven Miles,</strong> will today announce he will ban logging in between 50,000 and 60,000 hectares of high value ecosystem within the Eastern Hardwoods region in Wide Bay, north of Brisbane.<br><br>
 In addition, a new park to protect the greater glider will be established in the south-east Queensland bioregion.</p><p>The state government will also appoint an advisory group to develop a 30-year plan for the sector.

 That’s why I’m doing what matters to support timber workers and the industry to continue building our state, while also increasing our protected area estate.<br><br>
