 The ambition behind the 80 per cent employment target is both clear and important ..</p><p>To deliver on this policy agenda, government and small businesses must work in partnership to drive real change through the whole employment system and make sure the country is helping those who most need work.</p><p>It is right to ensure that young people who are seeking work are helped to find a job or training. Positive early experiences in the jobs market are vital for young people’s future life chances. They must be supported to take part, not faced with self-defeating sanctions.</p><p>Success will also depend on ministers making the investment that’s needed in health services and quality training.
