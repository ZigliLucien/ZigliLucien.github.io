There were 24-hour rainfall totals on Wednesday of 375.8mm recorded in Bagafa and 324.4mm in Belonia. The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India. The situation is therefore only expected to worsen, with a further 100-150mm falling through Thursday and Friday as rivers continue to remain at breaking point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/23/weather-tracker-deaths-and-displaced-in-north-east-india-floods">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
