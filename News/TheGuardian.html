Islamic State has claimed responsibility</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/23/moscow-concert-attack-crocus-city-hall-shooting-russia-live-updates">Moscow attack – latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and many wounded in an attack at a concert venue near Moscow.</p><p>Here is what we know about the shooting so far:</p><p>Russia has arrested 11 people including four suspected gunmen in connection with a shooting rampage that killed at least 133 in a concert hall near Moscow on Friday, the Kremlin said.</p><p>Up to five gunmen are believed to have been involved in the attack, later claimed by Islamic State in a post on Telegram, which suggested that the attackers had managed to escape afterwards. Videos released by social media channels close to the security services showed at least two armed men walking into the hall.<br></p><p>Videos emerged showing gunmen in tactical gear opening fire with automatic weapons as panicked Russians fled for their lives. One witness told the news agency Agence-France Presse that as people ran towards emergency exits, “there was a terrible crush” with concert-goers climbing on one another’s heads to get out.</p><p>A journalist for state news agency Ria at the concert said the attackers also threw a grenade or incendiary bomb, which began a blaze that quickly spread through the building. The roof of the venue was collapsing, Ria reported. Three helicopters were involved in efforts to put out the fire. Shortly after midnight, the emergencies ministry said the fire had been contained.</p><p>The emergencies ministry said fire services had helped about 100 people escape through the basement of the concert hall. Tass news agency said all of the Piknik group had been evacuated safely. Rescue operations were also launched for people trapped on the roof.</p><p>Authorities said a “terrorist” investigation had been started and Vladimir Putin was receiving “constant” updates, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.</p><p>Earlier this month, western countries led by the US had issued terror warnings and told their citizens not to join public gatherings in Russia. On 8 March, the US embassy wrote it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts, and US citizens should be advised to avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours”.</p><p>Russia did not immediately attribute blame for the attack. Former president Dmitry Medvedev did say, however, that Ukrainian leaders found to be involved would be “destroyed”.</p><p>The US presidency called the attack “terrible” and said there was no immediate sign of any link to the conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine’s presidency said Kyiv had “nothing to do” with the attack, while its military intelligence called the incident a Russian “provocation” and charged that Moscow special services were behind it.</p><p>Russia tightened security at airports, transport hubs and across the capital – a vast urban area of more than 21 million people. All large-scale public events have been cancelled across the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/moscow-concert-hall-shooting-attack-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
