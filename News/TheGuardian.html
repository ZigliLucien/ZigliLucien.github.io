<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>The Labour leader confirmed he would scrap the Rwanda scheme in his Dover speech, then confusingly blurred his own argument</p><p>Could Keir Starmer “Make Asylum Boring Again”? That would be the ultimate test of success for his claim that he can grip the issue that has caused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/29/uk-not-accept-return-asylum-seekers-ireland-rishi-sunak">Rishi Sunak more trouble</a> than any other. Starmer’s message is that he is no less committed to securing the borders and stopping the small boats crossing the Channel, but that achieving this requires a serious plan to tackle smuggling gangs and fix the asylum system in Britain too. So how different is Labour’s plan – and would it work?<br><br>Labour’s analysis should be that making asylum work depends on blending control and compassion. The Dover speech was a political exercise in asymmetric triangulation. Robust messages about control were loudly proclaimed. More liberal ideas about a rules-based system could be found, but mostly by reading between the lines.<br><br>Starmer did confirm that Labour would scrap the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/07/asylum-seekers-hide-or-flee-to-ireland-to-avoid-uk-rwanda-detentions">Rwanda scheme</a>. Labour had seemed to wobble in the face of premature Conservative confidence that Rwanda is already working to deter. Ironically, the biggest risk for Sunak’s deterrent argument would come if he finally gets to test it practically. Send the first flights to Rwanda this summer and further arrivals across the Channel will surely outpace any removals 10 times over.<br><br>There is a clash of principle over asylum. Labour would process the asylum claims of those who arrived without permission. The Conservatives have now passed several laws vowing they will not. Yet ministers are in denial. Whether or not up to 500 people go to Rwanda does not give the government any plan for the next 50,000 people it still claims it intends to remove. So flagship new duties on the home secretary to refuse these claims for ever have not been given legal force – as the courts would strike that out in all those cases where the government has no realistic alternative. Yet the government has ceased to process asylum cases, reversing last year’s success in clearing the historic backlog.</p><p>Starmer is right to deny the charge that Labour’s policy is an “amnesty”, since processing the backlog would see some asylum claims granted and others refused. But he confusingly blurs his own argument with a tit-for-tat labelling of government policy as a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/09/starmer-pledges-to-rip-up-rwanda-scheme-and-tackle-people-smuggling">Travelodge amnesty</a>”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/12/starmer-plan-asylum-rwanda-scheme-dover-speech-labour-leader">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
