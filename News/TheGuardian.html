We will use all legal options available as we continue to fight to end this case, which should never have been brought in the first place.</p><p>She further allowed the regular and loose exchange of money between them without any exact or verifiable measure of reconciliation. This lack of a confirmed financial split creates the possibility and appearance that the District Attorney benefited – albeit non-materially – from a contract whose award lay solely within her purview and policing.</p><p>This finding is by no means an indication that the Court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the District Attorney’s testimony during the evidentiary hearing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/mar/15/biden-trump-election-campaign-supreme-court-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
