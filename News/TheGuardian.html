Ideally, they are places where people from all backgrounds can come together and learn from each other,” said Freeman, a Central graduate and star of <em>The Responder</em>, <em>Sherlock</em> and <em>The Office</em>. “Without my grant from Richmond council many years ago, I would never have been able to enjoy my three years at Central.
