The decision is a big win for Republicans, who were aided by the US supreme court’s slow action on the case.</p><p>In January 2023, a three-judge panel struck down the state’s first congressional district, which is currently represented by Nancy Mace, a Republican. The judges said legislative Republicans had impermissibly used race when they redrew it after the 2020 census. As part of an effort to make it more solidly Republican, lawmakers removed 30,000 Black voters from the district into a neighboring one. Republicans argued that they moved the voters to achieve partisan ends, which is legal. The district was extremely competitive in 2020, but Mace easily won the redrawn version in 2022.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/28/south-carolina-republicans-discriminatory-map-election-2024">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
