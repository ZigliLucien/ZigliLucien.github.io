House Speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> has been facing mounting pressure regarding a Ukraine aid package, not just from <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, who has repeatedly chastised Republicans for not helping Ukraine, but from hard-right members of his own party who remain staunchly opposed to additional Ukraine aid. Johnson is set to travel to Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Friday to meet with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> – who has said he would negotiate an end to the conflict as he tries to push the US to a more isolationist stance.</p><p><strong>A Russian drone damaged equipment at a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast overnight, cutting power to a number of households and individual consumers,</strong> Ukrainian energy operator <strong>Ukrenergo</strong> said on Telegram. The attack came after Russian missiles and drones destroyed a large electricity plant near <strong>Kyiv</strong> and hit power facilities in several regions of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> on Thursday, destroying the <strong>Trypilska</strong> coal-powered thermal power plant near the capital. Ukrenergo said 399 settlements were without power as of Friday morning, with a blackout in the Dnipropetrovsk, <strong>Donetsk</strong>, <strong>Sumy,</strong> <strong>Kharkiv</strong>, and <strong>Kherson</strong> oblasts.</p><p><strong>Thousands of Russian soldiers are fleeing the war in Ukraine, lying low while awaiting the results of their asylum applications to western countries</strong> like Germany, France and the US. Asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged, but few are winning protection – policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security. Fewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the US in fiscal year 2022 while less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.
