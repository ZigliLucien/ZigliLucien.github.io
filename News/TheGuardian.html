You didn’t get much out of him after nine years, but if people want to fall back into that and go, well, you know, Labor’s had three years and that’s all we’re going to give them, and you want to go back to the good old days – which I wouldn’t say were the good old days under the Liberal National party – then be my guest.</p><p>It’s not just about the last three years in government, it’s probably about the last 10. So have a look at who had control of that for nine years beforehand.</p><p>Because quite frankly, <strong>I think Labor’s doing a fair bit of clean up.

In some places maximum temperatures are expected to drop by 15-20C over just a couple of days in contrast to above average temperatures in parts of the US earlier last week.</p><p>The rapid change in conditions is due to winds in the upper atmosphere weakening and meandering. At about six miles above the Earth’s surface there is a strong circulation known as the polar vortex around the north pole, which usually helps to keep cold air trapped there. However, late last week and early this week the circulation has been weakening and meandering, allowing a cold plume of air to be brought in from the north. Temperatures across central and eastern parts of the US are forecast to be 10-15C below average, with New York likely to see temperatures struggling to get out of negative double digits during daytime. As the cold air pushes in from the north, an area of low pressure will develop in the warmer gulf of Mexico, these two air masses will then clash across states bordering the Gulf of Mexico, bringing heavy rain and snow to areas that rarely see any. This cold spell is expected to last until the weekend, when temperatures will slowly start returning to around average.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/20/weather-tracker-polar-vortex-severe-cold-spell-us">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
