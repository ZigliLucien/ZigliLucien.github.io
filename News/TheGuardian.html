Donald Trump presented his proposal as one rooted in a concern for the safety of Palestinians: it was time to find many of the residents of Gaza somewhere else to live. “I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,” he said. “You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’”</p><p>That was more than stream of consciousness: Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/trump-repeats-suggestion-palestinians-should-leave-gaza-for-egypt-and-jordan">doubled down on his comments</a> on Monday. But the idea of “cleaning out” Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing.</p><p><em><strong>Kumbh Mela festival</strong></em> | <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/india-crowd-crush-kumbh-mela-religious-festival-death-toll-injuries-prayagraj">Dozens of people are feared to have died</a> in crowd crushes at India’s Kumbh Mela festival, local officials have said, as vast crowds went to bathe at one of the holiest sites of the Hindu gathering.

As a reminder, Israel has ordered the UN agency to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem by Thursday, after the country’s parliament passed a law in October <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/what-is-unrwa-and-why-has-israels-parliament-voted-to-ban-it">banning its operations</a> in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Israel’s ban only directly covers Israeli territory, which Israel considers East Jerusalem to be. Unrwa also operates in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, but it was unclear how the law will affect Unrwa’s work there.</p><p>The international development committee, which scrutinises the aid policy of the British foreign ministry, has warned that the Unrwa ban could cause the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to “deteriorate rapidly, possibly irreparably” and would “almost certainly lead to further conflict and increased displacement”.</p><p><em>Let us be clear: this ban will be devastating for Palestinian refugees across the region. Food, water, education, even rubbish collection will all be affected.</em></p><p><em>In the strongest possible terms, I urge the UK government to do everything it can to get all parties round the table and ensure that Unrwa can fulfil its UN-mandated work. The success of the current ceasefire hangs in the balance if not.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
