Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters.</p><p><strong>How many have been charged?</strong> The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement.</p><p><strong>How </strong><strong>popular would the move be?</strong> For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_121124/">found</a> that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol.</p><p><strong>What do we know about the attack?</strong> Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle.</p><p><strong>What do authorities believe about the motive?</strong> Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
