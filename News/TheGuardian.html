The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India. The situation is therefore only expected to worsen, with a further 100-150mm falling through Thursday and Friday as rivers continue to remain at breaking point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/23/weather-tracker-deaths-and-displaced-in-north-east-india-floods">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
