Another strike with guided aerial bombs destroyed a hospital in the border town of Vovchansk.</p><p><strong>In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, Russian missiles killed four people, including a girl aged 10, and injured seven more</strong>, the governor, Oleg Kiper, said on Telegram. Ukraine’s energy ministry said two facilities in the south had been targeted in strikes during the night, causing power outages in two regions.</p><p><strong>In Russia, a Ukrainian drone attack on Wednesday killed three people, including two children</strong>, in the Kursk border region, the local governor said. The drone fired a rocket at a civilian car in a village in Korenevski district, the governor, Roman Starovoyt, said on Telegram.</p><p><strong>The US top general in Europe has told Congress Ukraine will be outgunned 10 to one by Russia within a matter of weeks if more ammunition and weapons are not sent to Kyiv soon.</strong> “The Russians fire five times as many artillery shells at the Ukrainians than the Ukrainians are able to fire back. That will immediately go to 10 to one in a matter of weeks,” Gen Christopher Cavoli said. “We’re not talking about months. We’re not talking hypothetically.”</p><p><strong>Joe Biden on Wednesday urged the US House of Representatives to vote immediately on the $60bn Ukraine bill.</strong> “There’s overwhelming support for Ukraine among the majority of Democrats and Republicans. There should be a vote now,” the president told reporters.
