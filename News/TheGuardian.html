It does not say enough to reflect the totality of the UN Security Council resolution nor does it say enough about the totality of what should be Australia’s clear, unequivocal moral conviction in this conflict.</p><p>That is why I present and seek leave to move amendments in this chamber, which would better reflect the UN Security Council resolution—namely, that the call for a ceasefire was for an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan, a ceasefire that would secure the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and that that can then lead to a sustainable ceasefire.</p><p>I know that this motion may not reflect every aspect of all our positions on these issues, but there is enough here to agree on. I ask senators to look for the points that are in front of them. Whether senators consider themselves a friend of Israelis or Palestinians or both, as I do, we should be able to come together in agreeing on the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. When hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are starving, we should be able to come together to underline the urgency of an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan leading to a sustainable ceasefire as per the UN Security Council resolution; we should be able to come together to demand Hamas comply with the Security Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages; and we should be able to come together to demand that the Netanyahu government comply with the Security Council’s demand that all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale are removed.</p><p>If the divided United Nations Security Council could come together on these issues then we ought to be able to do likewise. If countries as different as Algeria, Ecuador, France, the United Kingdom and others can agree on these points, then we ought to be able to do likewise. Not a single country voted against this resolution, and we should recognise what it means that not one of the permanent five members of the Security Council stood in the way. Right now we are faced with reports from the United Nations that 650,000 Palestinians in Gaza are starving and well over a million are at risk of starvation. Right now more than 1.7 million people in Gaza are internally displaced.</p><p>There are, as I have said, increasingly few safe spaces to go. Right now there are more than 130 hostages still being held by the terror group Hamas, and we condemn Hamas’ actions as we have always done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/mar/27/australia-politics-live-question-time-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-bill-shorten-ndis-fuel-efficiency-immigration-detainees-bushfire-assange">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Scholars must accept the principles of the ruling party of country B, and direction from country B’s government via consular staff. Depending on the circumstances, these arrangements may undermine free speech and academic freedom at University A. If so, that university is likely to have to terminate or amend the scholarship agreement.</p><p>If it means that there are people who are employed by an institute who are preventing legitimate protests or shutting down lecturers from covering certain kinds <em>of</em> content regarding that country for instance, or that country’s foreign policy … If that behaviour amounts to a restriction <em>of</em> <em>freedom</em> <em>of</em> <em>speech</em> within the law, and someone brings a complaint to us, then we may find that the complaint is justified and then we make recommendations …</p><p>If there are problems, universities will have to do everything they can to act compatibly with their <em>freedom</em>-<em>of</em>-<em>speech</em> duties. Insofar as that means a rethinking <em>of</em> their relationship with other countries, obviously that’s something that would be a good idea for them to start thinking about now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/mar/26/rishi-sunak-national-insurance-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
