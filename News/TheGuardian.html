Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among those <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/rwandan-and-congolese-leaders-join-summit-on-eastern-drc-conflict">who took part in a regional summit</a> aimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_84fd8896-d3e0-40bb-ac16-14475454f836">a lull in the fighting yesterday</a>, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war.</p><p>Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control.

The play will open in September in Chichester’s smaller Minerva theatre. “We are imagining that Old Hamlet [the prince’s father] has let the kingdom decline,” says Audibert, whose production will explore the “leadership vacuum” that comes from an older generation “clinging on to power for a really long time”. Hamlet’s father “has definitely got some Biden vibes” says Audibert, and the director has also been reflecting on the succession of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad from his father, Hafez.

Ravenhill said he had been attracted to the “generosity of spirit and comic energy” of the scenarios. “They are sexually frank, with the women given as much agency as the men. They are socially acute, depicting the newly rich mixing with the urban poor and new migrants from the countryside. They are grounded in money, sex and the body.” Collectively, the storylines depict a world “in which we are all fools and we all need to find a way to get along”. His aim, Ravenhill said, was not to make a historical reconstruction but “to write plays that allow contemporary audiences to laugh and to celebrate our shared humanity”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/feb/13/mark-ravenhill-reveals-10-new-plays-to-be-performed-over-two-days">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
