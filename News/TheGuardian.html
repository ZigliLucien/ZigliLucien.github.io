The report also references a supreme court ruling expanding presidential immunity, which complicated the case, and Trump’s repeated legal attacks, which took up time and resources to fight.</p><p><strong>How did Trump respond?</strong> In a social media post, Trump called the special counsel a “lamebrain prosecutor”.</p><p><strong>What do we know about the terms of the potential deal?</strong> Reuters reports that negotiations are advanced over releasing 33 of 98 hostages still in Gaza in the first stage of the deal, citing an Israeli official. In return, Israel will free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Palestinian source close to the talks, who said the first phase would last for 60 days.</p><p><strong>While negotiators meet, is the war still raging?</strong> Yes. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, and Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/first-thing-special-counsel-jack-smith-trump-convicted-2020-election">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
