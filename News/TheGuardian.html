A contract for facial recognition software, worth up to £20m, was put up for grabs last week by a police procurement body set up by the Home Office, reigniting concerns about “mass biometric surveillance”.</p><p>The Department for Work and Pensions has been using generative AI to read more than 20,000 documents a day to “understand and summarise correspondence” after which the full information is then shared with officials for decision-making. It has automated systems for detecting fraud and error in universal credit claims, and AI assists agents working on personal independence payment claims by summarising evidence. This autumn, DWP started deploying basic AI tools in jobcentres, allowing work coaches to ask questions about universal credit guidance in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of conversations with jobseekers.</p><p>The Home Office deploys an AI-powered immigration enforcement system, which critics call a “robo-caseworker”. An algorithm is involved in shaping decisions, including returning people to their home countries. The government describes it as a “rules-based” rather than AI system, as it does not involve machine-learning from data. It says it brings efficiencies by prioritising work, but that a human remains responsible for each decision. The system is being used amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/22/uk-asylum-backlog-rose-before-election-despite-sunak-pledge">a rising caseload</a> of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, now at about 41,000 people.</p><p>Several police forces use facial recognition software to track down suspected criminals with the help of artificial intelligence. These have included the Metropolitan police, South Wales police and Essex police. Critics have warned that such software “will transform the streets of Britain into hi-tech police line-ups”, but supporters say it catches criminal suspects and the data of innocent passersby is not stored.</p><p>NHS England has a £330m contract with Palantir to create a huge new data platform. The deal with the US company that <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-and-the-nhs-dd1362982fa9">builds AI-enabled digital infrastructure</a> and is led by Donald Trump backer Peter Thiel has sparked concerns about patient privacy, although Palantir says its customers retain full control of the data.</p><p>An AI chatbot is being trialled to help people navigate the sprawling gov.uk government website.
