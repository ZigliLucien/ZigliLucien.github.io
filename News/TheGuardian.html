Say like USAid, right? We authorized that. That’s a creature of Congress. If they try to do something like that, then you’re going to get into a constitutional argument or crisis.</p><p>Before making cuts rashly, the administration should be studying and staffing to see what the consequences are. Measure twice before cutting. They have had to backtrack multiple times.</p><p>We all want efficiencies, there is a way to do it, and the way these people have been treated has been awful in many cases. Awful.</p><p>Dozens of Alaskans – potentially over 100 in total – are being fired as part of the Trump administration’s reduction-in-force order for the federal government.</p><p>Many of these abrupt terminations will do more harm than good, stunting opportunities in Alaska and leaving holes in our communities. We can’t realize our potential for responsible energy and mineral development if we can’t permit projects. We will be less prepared to manage summer wildfires if we can’t support those on the front lines. Our tourism economy will be damaged if we don’t maintain our world-class national parks and forests.</p><p>Congress can’t do anything except complain about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/19/trump-musk-ukraine-executive-orders-doge-politics-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
