It does not say enough to reflect the totality of the UN Security Council resolution nor does it say enough about the totality of what should be Australia’s clear, unequivocal moral conviction in this conflict.</p><p>That is why I present and seek leave to move amendments in this chamber, which would better reflect the UN Security Council resolution—namely, that the call for a ceasefire was for an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan, a ceasefire that would secure the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and that that can then lead to a sustainable ceasefire.</p><p>I know that this motion may not reflect every aspect of all our positions on these issues, but there is enough here to agree on. I ask senators to look for the points that are in front of them. Whether senators consider themselves a friend of Israelis or Palestinians or both, as I do, we should be able to come together in agreeing on the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. When hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are starving, we should be able to come together to underline the urgency of an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan leading to a sustainable ceasefire as per the UN Security Council resolution; we should be able to come together to demand Hamas comply with the Security Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages; and we should be able to come together to demand that the Netanyahu government comply with the Security Council’s demand that all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale are removed.</p><p>If the divided United Nations Security Council could come together on these issues then we ought to be able to do likewise. If countries as different as Algeria, Ecuador, France, the United Kingdom and others can agree on these points, then we ought to be able to do likewise. Not a single country voted against this resolution, and we should recognise what it means that not one of the permanent five members of the Security Council stood in the way. Right now we are faced with reports from the United Nations that 650,000 Palestinians in Gaza are starving and well over a million are at risk of starvation. Right now more than 1.7 million people in Gaza are internally displaced.</p><p>There are, as I have said, increasingly few safe spaces to go. Right now there are more than 130 hostages still being held by the terror group Hamas, and we condemn Hamas’ actions as we have always done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/mar/27/australia-politics-live-question-time-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-bill-shorten-ndis-fuel-efficiency-immigration-detainees-bushfire-assange">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Here’s what chair <strong>Jaime Harrison</strong> had to say about Lands’s victory:</p><p>Today’s election – one of the first since the devastating decision by the Alabama supreme court that stopped IVF care – was a referendum on Maga Republicans’ out-of-touch extremism on reproductive rights. Marilyn Lands’ victory demonstrates that voters aren’t going to sit idly by while Maga Republicans lay the groundwork for a national abortion ban.</p><p>Last month, Alabamans lost access to fertility treatments because of Donald Trump. Tonight, the voters in Alabama’s 10th house district elected a pro-choice champion in Marilyn Lands, sending Trump and extreme Maga Republicans a clear message: they know exactly who’s to blame for restricting their ability to decide how and when to build their families and they’re ready to fight back. Trump overturned Roe vWade, paving the way for attacks on women’s freedoms like we saw in Alabama – now he’s running to ban abortion and gut access to IVF nationwide. Tonight’s results should serve as a major warning sign for Trump: voters will not stand for his attacks on reproductive healthcare. This November will be no different.</p><p><strong>Six construction workers </strong>working on Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key bridge when it was struck by a container ship and collapsed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/27/baltimore-bridge-workers-names">are presumed dead</a>, after rescuers spent most of yesterday attempting to locate them.</p><p><strong>Ronna McDaniel</strong>, the former Republican party chair known for spreading <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s election lies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/26/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc-rnc">was axed</a> by NBC after an outcry.</p><p><strong>Americans</strong> once narrowly supported Israel’s campaign in Gaza, but are now generally opposed to it, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642695/majority-disapprove-israeli-action-gaza.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">new polling</a> from Gallup shows.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/mar/27/trump-biden-latest-republican-democrat-win-alabama-ronna-mcdaniel">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
