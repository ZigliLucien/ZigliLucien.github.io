In a filing late last week, the bureau cited the risk of AI-generated deepfakes as one of the reasons it refuses to release audio of the president’s interview with special counsel Robert Hur. The conversation about Biden’s handling of classified documents is a source of heated political contention, with Republicans pushing for release of the recordings and the White House moving to block them.</p><p>The justice department’s filing, which it <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000018f-d4ba-d1c4-a3ff-feffcde20000">released late on Friday night</a>, argues that the recording should not be released on a variety of grounds including privacy interests and executive privilege.
