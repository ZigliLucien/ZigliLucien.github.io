When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and “execution after birth”, Davis responded: “There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.”</p><p><strong>Another boost for Harris:</strong> After the debate concluded, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady">Taylor Swift endorsed Harris</a> on Instagram, signing the post as “childless cat lady” in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/first-thing-kamla-harris-comes-out-swinging-in-presidential-debate-donald-trump">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
