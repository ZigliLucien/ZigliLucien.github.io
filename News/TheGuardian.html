President Trump has proven that he will fight for rural Americans, stand up to China, support our farmers, ensure fair trade deals for workers, and defend our ideals across the globe.</p><p>Rural America is ready to help get vice president Kamala Harris elected to the White House! Together, we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully our neighbors and continue to let stereotypes that Trump and JD Vance perpetuate go unanswered or unchecked about our strong rural communities … The Trump Republicans have weird obsessions and outdated ideas about our reproductive health, public schools, immigrants, and veterans. We know our towns better than the consultants propping up Vance and Trump and that is why we endorse Kamala AND are committed to turning out 5% more rural voters for Democrats up and down the ballot!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/02/harris-trump-election-campaign-fundraising-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
