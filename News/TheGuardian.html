In a Sunday interview <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/-i-m-in-a-good-place-with-pete-hegseth-but-potential-accusers-have-to-come-forward-sen-graham-227109957528">with NBC News</a>, Graham said that Hegseth “told me he would release her from that agreement”.</p><p>I’m in a good place with Pete unless something I don’t know about comes out. These allegations are disturbing, but they’re anonymous. I asked him point blank, were you drunk in a bar and got up and said, let’s kill all the Muslims. He said, no. There’s one allegation on a police report about sexual assault, that person has the right to come forward to the committee. But about mismanagement of money, about, you know, having a drinking problem and saying inappropriate things, all of these are anonymous allegations.</p><p>He’s given me his side of the story. It makes sense to me, I believe him. Unless somebody’s willing to come forward, I think he’s going to get through.</p><p>Ms. Gillibrand has pleaded her E.R.A. case at every available opportunity. The third-term New Yorker has met with Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House chief of staff, and Anita Dunn, a former top adviser to Mr. Biden. Her request is for a five-minute meeting with Mr. Biden himself. She has used passing 30-second interactions in photo lines to personally pitch the president, so far to no avail.</p><p>Ms. Gillibrand has presented White House officials with fat binders full of legal research and polling, which have on the cover a printout of Mr. Biden posing as if he is on a Taylor Swift Eras Tour poster.
