Accounts claiming to speak for IS have falsely claimed responsibility for atrocities in the past.</p><p>Earlier, police detained a 15-year-old at his parents’ home in the early hours of Saturday, which prosecutors said was on suspicion of failing to report a crime. Public prosecutor Markus Caspers said of the 15-year-old that he was alleged to have spoken to the perpetrator “shortly before the crime”.</p><p>A second arrest was made following a police operation at a home for refugees in Solingen, a police spokesperson said.

They said they had had no indication in the run-up to the festival that there was a security threat.</p><p>Three people – two men, aged 67 and 56, and a woman, 56 – were killed on Friday night during a festival of diversity to mark the city of Solingen’s 650th anniversary, which began on Friday and was supposed to run through to Sunday.

The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India.
