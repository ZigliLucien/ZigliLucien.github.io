During the early years of the coalition, five ambitious backbenchers co-authored<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19300051"> a book </a>called Britannia Unchained saying British workers were “among the worst idlers in the world”.

I think had my suggestions been listened to a bit earlier, then there was a there’s a much higher chance that [the mini-budget] would have worked.
