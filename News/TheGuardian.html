<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>Landmark ruling could shape historical narrative of key event in anti-government protests</p><p>A Hong Kong judge has convicted seven people, including a pro-democracy former lawmaker, of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/hong-kong-mass-china-extradition-bill-demonstrations-protestors">anti-government protests in July 2019</a>.<br><br>
 Prosecutors accused the former legislator Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/26/hong-kong-pro-democracy-lawmakers-arrested-over-2019-yuen-long-protests">provoking members of a group of about 100 men</a> armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station. The men, all clad in white shirts in contrast to the black worn by protesters, claimed to be protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong‘s New Territories.<br><br>
 Dozens of people, including Lam, were injured in the violence, a key chapter that escalated the protest movement as the public criticised police for their delayed response. The landmark ruling could shape the city’s historical narrative of the incident.<br><br>
 Judge Stanley Chan ruled that Lam was not acting as a mediator as he had claimed, but rather was trying to exploit the situation for political gain. He said Lam’s words, directed at the white-shirted men, had “fanned the flames”.<br><br>
 The seven defendants are expected to be sentenced in February. Several members of the public sitting in the gallery cried after hearing the verdicts. Others waved at the defendants, with one shouting to Lam, “Hang in there, Ting!” <br><br>
 The prosecution alleged the defendants had either berated the white-shirted men, used obscene hand gestures, hurled objects or shot jets of water at them with a hosepipe.<br><br>
 The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the rioting charge.<br><br>
 During the trial, Lam said he chose to go to Yuen Long because he hoped his then position as a lawmaker could pressure the police to act quickly. He said he could not leave the scene while fellow residents were in danger. Some defendants who targeted the white-shirted men with a hosepipe argued that they were trying to stop the attackers from advancing.<br><br>
 Chan, the judge, rejected the arguments of some defendants that they acted in self defence.<br><br>
 The 2019 protests were sparked by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/the-last-fight-for-hong-kong-activists-gear-up-to-protest-extradition-law">proposed extradition law</a> that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city’s leaders and police accountability.<br><br>
 The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/china-passes-controversial-hong-kong-national-security-law">national security law in 2020</a>, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile.<br><br>
 In November, Lam was sentenced to six years and nine months in jail in the city’s biggest national security case.<br><br>
 More than 10,000 people were arrested in connection to the protests for various crimes, such as rioting and participating in an unauthorised assembly. About 10 white-shirted men were convicted in other cases related to the mob violence in July 2019, local media reported.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/12/hong-kong-judge-convicts-former-pro-democracy-lawmaker-and-six-others-over-2019-riots">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
