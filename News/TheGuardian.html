He writes for the news network:</p><p>Israeli artillery units have been relentlessly pounding the Nuseirat refugee camp – in the northern part of that densely populated area – where thousands of Palestinians are. They have also been taking a systematic approach to destroying residential buildings in al-Mughraqa.</p><p>Here in Rafah in the south, the situation is also dire.

International bodies like the ICC arose in the wake of the Holocaust committed against the Jewish people. They were set up to prevent such horrors, to prevent future genocides.</p><p>This ICC attempt is an attempt to paralyze Israel’s very ability to defend itself.
