And I just question whether there has been any slackening of the process, whether there has been any compromise on the security checks, and whether it’s in our country’s best interests for people to receive citizenship before the proper security checks have been undertaken, or people have had – within the home affairs department – the time to be able to conduct the searches that we would expect to be conducted.”</p><p>What would you like to happen to be assured that the processes are being followed?”</p><p>There needs to be transparency.

Why would you bring people in from a war zone without the requisite checks, on a tourist visa, without precedent?
