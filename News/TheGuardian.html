 The tanker was also carrying cattle in the Agaie area in north-central Niger state, at least 50 of which were burned alive, Abdullahi Baba-Arab, director-general of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, said. He added that search and rescue operations were under way at the scene of the accident.<br><br>
 Baba-Arab said initially that 30 bodies were found, but in a later statement said an additional 18 bodies of victims who were burned to death in the collision were found. He said the dead had been given a mass burial.<br><br>
 Mohammed Bago, the governor of Niger state, said residents of the affected area should remain calm and asked road users to “always be cautious and abide by road traffic regulations to safeguard lives and property”.<br><br>
 In the absence of an efficient railway system to transport cargo, fatal truck accidents are common along most of the major roads in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.<br><br>
 In 2020 alone, there were 1,531 gasoline tanker crashes, resulting in 535 fatalities and 1,142 injuries, according to Nigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/08/nigeria-dead-after-explosion-fuel-tanker-truck-collision">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India. The situation is therefore only expected to worsen, with a further 100-150mm falling through Thursday and Friday as rivers continue to remain at breaking point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/23/weather-tracker-deaths-and-displaced-in-north-east-india-floods">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Margaret Thatcher is no longer with us, but for Conservative party members she is still the one figure from the party’s recent past whose authority is more or less unquestioned and <strong>Peter Lilley</strong> has written<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/kemi-badenoch-engineer-fix-britain-dcnw7frrv"> an article</a> claiming that Badenoch would be a worthy inheritor of her mantle. He says Thatcher was a scientist, and Badenoch is an engineering graduate. Like Thatcher, Badenoch is focused on facts, and what works, he says. He goes on:</p><p>Leadership candidates are under great pressure to make popular pledges, to abolish specific taxes or set a numerical limit on immigration. Kemi, rightly in my view, has <a href="https://archive.is/o/wWsCE/https://www.thetimes.com/article/kemi-badenoch-uk-integration-xxznv27vq">refused to do so</a>. Voters want lower taxes and much less immigration (as do I), but they have seen every glib promise broken. To convince them, a new leader will need to show first, that policies have been rigorously worked out in practical terms and second, that we truly believe in them rather than adopting them to win votes. As Margaret Thatcher said: “To carry conviction, you must have conviction.”</p><p>Conviction is the fruit of hard-nosed scepticism. Kemi’s approach is similar to Margaret Thatcher’s, for whom I once worked. When ministers took a policy to her which was in line with all her prejudices, expecting instant approval, she would tear into it, challenging every weakness. Only when satisfied that a policy was totally robust would she take it on board – but then she pursued it with unwavering conviction. Kemi is likewise willing to challenge, criticise and <a href="https://archive.is/o/wWsCE/https://www.thetimes.com/article/blue-ambition-unauthorised-biography-kemi-badenoch-michael-ashcroft-review-brnm22n9q">expose weaknesses</a>, which does not endear her to everyone. But we cannot afford to go on adopting half-baked, unworkable policies.</p><p>We can rage at Labour’s actions, but the public won’t listen to our narrative – unless we have a leader who can communicate.</p><p>Kemi Badenoch is that person. She is blessed with that rare gift in politics: the X-factor that means she can not only communicate but achieve all important ‘cut-through’, so that the public actually notice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/09/winter-fuel-payment-vote-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
