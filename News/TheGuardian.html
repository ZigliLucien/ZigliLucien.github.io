Analysts suggest a wider war could suit Netanyahu by keeping allies onside, after Israel came under pressure over the scale of civilian casualties in Gaza. Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s wartime unity government, said Israel would build a regional coalition and retaliate against Iran “in the fashion and timing that is right for us”.</p><p><strong>How is the Biden administration acting?</strong> Iran’s attack has forced the US to reiterate its commitment to Israeli security while simultaneously distancing itself from a full-scale conflict. A senior administration official told reporters on Sunday the US was “committed to defending Israel” but “would not be a part of any response they do”, adding that the goal was to de-escalate regional tensions.</p><p><strong>This is a fast-moving story. </strong>Netanyahu is scheduled to speak at 9am ET. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/apr/15/middle-east-crisis-live-news-iran-drone-attack-israel-latest-updates">Follow the Guardian’s live coverage here</a>.</p><p><strong>What are the details of the case?</strong> Trump faces <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/14/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-timeline">34 felony counts</a> of falsifying business records in connection to a $130,000 payment he made in 2016 to Daniels.
