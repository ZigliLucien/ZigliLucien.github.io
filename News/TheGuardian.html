In intercepted messages, Perlin referred to the missile attack on Budanov as a “big bird” and the drone as a “small bird”. He emphasised: “The order is rocket, drone, rocket.”</p><p>The SBU said it <strong>recovered drones, warheads and mines</strong> from one of the arrested Ukrainian alleged accomplices. He and others face charges of treason and terrorism. One of the alleged agents was a <strong>colonel serving in Ukraine’s state guard service</strong>,<strong> </strong>said to have met Kornev secretly before 2022 in a neighbouring European country.</p><p>Ukrainian prosecutors say they have examined debris from 21 of around 50 North Korean ballistic missiles launched by Russia between late December and late February. The office of the chief prosecutor, Andriy Kostin, told Reuters <strong>the missiles’ failure rate appeared to be high</strong>: “About half of the North Korean missiles lost their programmed trajectories and exploded in the air; in such cases the debris was not recovered.”</p><p>Use of North Korean missiles by Russia threatens a nearly two-decade consensus among permanent members of the UN security council on <strong>preventing North Korea expanding its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes</strong>. Russia recently vetoed the annual renewal of UN sanctions monitoring of North Korea.</p><p><strong>Russia has been shipping refined petroleum to North Korea</strong> at levels that appear to violate the mandates of the security council, a US official said on Thursday, adding that the US was planning new sanctions in response. The US would continue working with other countries to impose sanctions “against those working to facilitate <strong>arms and refined petroleum transfers between Russia and the DPRK”</strong>.</p><p>Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, has said he is <strong>open to discussing sending a Patriot system to Ukraine</strong> after German appeals to EU and Nato member states.<br>Iohannis met with the US president, Joe Biden, at the White House on Tuesday.</p><p>Ukrainian forces on Tuesday <strong>attacked an oil storage depot and sparked a large fire</strong>, injuring five people, on the outskirts of the <strong>Russian-held city of Luhansk</strong> in eastern Ukraine, the region’s Russia-installed leader said. There was no official Ukrainian statement on the incident. Separatist fighters backed and financed by Russia seized control of large chunks of Luhansk and Donetsk regions in eastern Ukraine in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-lviv-attack-putin-zelenskiy-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
