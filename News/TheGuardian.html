I don’t really want to get into a debate here that misses the point over whether it’s a national emergency or a national crisis. But <strong>an emergency declaration by state or territory governments kicks in immediate one-off actions by the federal government. What we need here is not one-off actions. What we need here is a concerted plan.</strong></p><p>The organisers throughout the country deserve credit for organising these rallies.<strong> I was happy not to speak. I was happy to speak,</strong> it was about raising awareness of the issue, but a call to action by all governments, quite clearly, we need to do more.</p><p>It’s not enough to just have empathy. The fact that one a woman dies every four days, on average, at the hand of a partner, is just a national crisis. So I’ll be convening the national cabinet on Wednesday. We’ll talk about what more we can do. Clearly governments need to do more, but as a society as well, we need to acknowledge that we need to change behaviour. We need to change attitudes. We need to change culture, because it is completely unacceptable.</p><p>I’m focused on the issue, Karl. It was an emotional day for people and I get that, on what is an emotional issue. Because women were saying yesterday, enough is enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/apr/29/australia-news-live-male-violence-online-misogyny-anthony-albanese-women-safety-yoorook-terrorism-attacks">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
