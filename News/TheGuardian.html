Persistent heavy rain from Monday to Wednesday resulted in several rivers exceeding danger and extreme danger marks, leading to widespread flooding that has caused the deaths of 10 people as well as displacing more than 34,000.</p><p>The southern Tripura districts had the worst of the floods and the 34,000 displaced people were being sheltered in the north of the region. There were 24-hour rainfall totals on Wednesday of 375.8mm recorded in Bagafa and 324.4mm in Belonia. The flooding and heavy rain led schools to shut down on Wednesday and Thursday, while Tripura University suspended all regular classes on Wednesday. The heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system situated over Bangladesh that is slowly moving westwards into north-east India. The situation is therefore only expected to worsen, with a further 100-150mm falling through Thursday and Friday as rivers continue to remain at breaking point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/23/weather-tracker-deaths-and-displaced-in-north-east-india-floods">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

They do not use their current powers and have incentivised water companies not to invest, while turning a blind eye to large dividend payments to shareholders. Asking Ofwat and the EA to use their existing powers doesn’t require new legislation, nor does doing things like taking away the Tory-introduced growth order which asks Ofwat to prioritise growth over the environment.</p><p>He thinks that the government should be more serious about putting failing water companies in special measures, and that if they are put in special measures then the shareholders who have made money out of the mismanagement of water companies should pay for it, not the taxpayer. In fact, this new bill is going to make it so operating costs on special administration get passed to billpayers if the sale of the water company does not cover these costs - and if Thames is sold for a very low price after going into special administration and this may need to happen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/05/grenfell-report-angela-rayner-labour-tories-uk-politics">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
