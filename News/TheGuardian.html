She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time – or only if she became president in 2027.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jul/01/euro-dollar-sterling-bond-markets-france-election-marine-le-pen-french-hung-parliament-manufacturing-ecb-business-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

In that scenario, President Emmanuel Macron – who called the snap poll three weeks ago after his party came a distant second to the RN in the European elections – would have to share power.
