We’re continuing the original retention bonus after your initial service obligation for three years and beyond that. There will be another bonus for people who stay in the defence force after that. And that’s really targeting those who are in their seventh, eighth, ninth years of service, which gets to the middle ranks where we’ve got an issue. And we’re also going to grow the active reserves so there are more opportunities for people in the reserve to do full-time or part-time work in the defence force.</p><p>This original plan goes back seven or eight years and it was about having two or three satellites above Australia to deliver that capability. Since then, we have seen technologies develop which can shoot satellites out of the sky but we have also seen technologies develop where you have thousands of micro satellites in a more distributed way providing the same effect and we are seeing that with Starlink above Ukraine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/05/australia-news-live-interest-rates-inflation-rba-melbourne-cup-weather-heatwave-defence-cash-bonuses-abortion-cost-of-living">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
