This is a no go.”</p><p><strong>The Kremlin continues to blame Ukraine for the attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, calling them “very dangerous”, but a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer has denied Kyiv’s involvement.</strong> The Guardian is unable to independently verify either account.</p><p><strong>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Beijing on Monday to display the strength of ties with close diplomatic ally China</strong>, amid Moscow’s war against Ukraine. Despite its backing of Russia in the Ukraine war, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters Monday that “China has an objective and fair position on the Ukraine issue … We have been actively promoting peace talks and political solutions. China is not a creator or party to the Ukraine crisis, and we have not and will not do anything to profit from it.”</p><p><strong>The US Treasury Secretary has threatened sanctions on China’s banks which aid Russia’s military capacity, amid Russia’s diplomatic visit to China.</strong> She told reporters, as she wrapped up four days of talks with China, that “any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia’s defence industrial base expose themselves to the risk of US sanctions.”</p><p><strong>The Kremlin has warned that a planned German military presence in Lithuania would escalate tensions.</strong> The Nato military alliance and EU member Lithuania, which borders Russia and its ally Belarus, said earlier it would partly finance permanently hosting of 5,000 German troops from 2027.</p><p><strong>More than 10,400 homes across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> have been flooded, triggering record water levels in the Ural mountains, Russia’s emergency ministry have said. </strong>“An increase in air temperatures, active snow melt and river openings are predicted,” Russia’s emergency ministry said. “More than 10,400 residential buildings remain flooded in 39 regions.” Russia’s government declared a federal emergency on Sunday over flood-hit areas, state media reported.</p><p><strong>A member of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) accused of taking money from a pro-Russian media site has denied any wrongdoing.</strong> German magazine Der Spiegel and Czech newspaper Denik N reported that Bystron had received money from the portal Voice of Europe, which was sanctioned by the Czech government late last month due to suspected Russian influence. Petr Bystron, a member of the German parliament and an AfD candidate in European parliament elections set for June, has “vehemently denied” the allegations, an AfD spokesperson told Reuters.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> said on Monday, after four days of talks with China, that she has warned the country’s banks and exporters of aiding Russia’s military capacity.</p><p>I stressed that companies, including those in the PRC, must not provide material support for Russia’s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do.
