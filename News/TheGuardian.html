Elsewhere, a wild temperature fluctuation in Iberia</p><p>Brazil was hit by devastating floods over the weekend that have so far claimed 20 lives in the resultant landslides and mudslides. There was heavy rainfall in parts of the south-east, including Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis and the larger Espírito Santo region, with hourly rainfall totals of about 20mm recorded in places. Cumulative totals from Friday through Sunday were close to 250mm, particularly along the coast: this is far higher than the monthly average.</p><p>Landslides and mudslides occurred across the region, and a number of houses collapsed. Rescue operations are under way to look for people who may have been stranded by the floods. Although there may still be a few showers over the following days, the worst of the rain has now passed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/25/weather-tracker-floods-brazil">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
