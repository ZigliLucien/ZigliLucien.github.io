In the southern Appalachians, where Helene dropped nearly 800 mm of rain, some weather stations have since reported no measurable precipitation. As of 28 October, data indicates that an eighth of the US experienced zero rainfall that month, affecting major cities such as New York, Houston, and San Francisco.</p><p>Compounding these dry conditions, high temperatures across the US have further stressed already parched landscapes. For example, in the High Plains and the south, temperatures soared 6 to 7C above normal during the last week of October. As a result, according to the National Drought Center, 77.8% of the US population were experiencing “abnormally dry” or “drought” conditions by the end of the month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/04/us-weather-tracker-zero-rain-unseasonable-heat-flash-droughts">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
