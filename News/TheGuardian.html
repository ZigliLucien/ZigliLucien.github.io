But if growth at any cost is the mantra, the costs will soon become painfully clear. Why pledge to be clean and green, only to undermine that commitment with a Heathrow expansion promise six months later? Burning the furniture to stay warm doesn’t signal confidence – it reeks of panic.</p><p>Regardless of the motivation, Labour has crossed the Rubicon. Approving Heathrow expansion is an irreversible break with our pre-election pledges. In 2021, Reeves stood in front of the Labour party conference and declared that she would be the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2021/sep/27/rachel-reeves-i-will-be-uks-first-green-chancellor-video">first-ever green chancellor</a>”.
