Here is what we know so far:</p><p><strong>Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israeli-military-says-it-may-have-killed-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar">military said it had killed Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza</a>. </strong>In a statement, the IDF said: “After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.”</p><p><strong>The statement came shortly after the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, also said Sinwar had been killed. </strong>“Mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of 7 October, was killed today by IDF soldiers,” Katz said in a statement.</p><p><strong>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Sinwar’s death as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-israel-war">“the beginning of the end”</a> but warned the “task before us is not yet complete”. </strong>In a press conference, Netanyahu said Israel will continue to work until the end of the war.</p><p><strong>To the people of Israel, Netanyahu said that there are “a lot of challenges still facing us” and that “we have to</strong> remain resilient” and “stand firm on our ground and to continue to fight”. He added: “We will not stop the war. We will go into Rafah.”</p><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden said Israeli reports that Sinwar had been killed marked a “good day” for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, the US and the world and compared it to how Americans felt after Osama bin Laden’s death.</strong> Biden said in a statement that DNA tests confirmed Sinwar’s death. Biden reportedly spoke to Netanyahu and they agreed to work towards a deal to free the remaining hostages.</p><p><strong>Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, said “justice has been served” after Sinwar’s death was announced.</strong> She said “this moment gives us an opportunity to end the war in Gaza” and stressed the need to end suffering in Gaza.</p><p><strong>Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has commended the Israeli military, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and the security services for the killing of </strong><strong> Sinwar. </strong>In a post to X, Herzog described Sinwar as the “mastermind” behind the 7 October <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> attacks on Israel and for being “responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians” for years. He added: “His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East.”</p><p><strong>In a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said that no hostages were believed to have been present at the site</strong> of the killing in the Gaza Strip, where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said “three terrorists were eliminated”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/hunt-for-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-prime-target">Some in the defence establishment had believed that Sinwar was likely to have surrounded himself with human shields as he sought to evade Israeli troops.</a></p><p><strong>Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has recently spoken with his US counterpart, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, according to a US official. </strong>The call came moments after Katz announced Sinwar was dead, the official said. According to CNN, Austin was passed a note about Sinwar’s death during a Nato meeting in Brussels earlier today.</p><p><strong>Israel’s Kan Radio reported that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> leader</strong><strong> was killed “by chance”, and not as a result of intelligence gathering.</strong> The station also said the bodies found at the site were found with large amounts of cash and fake IDs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israel-says-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-is-dead-what-we-know-so-far">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
