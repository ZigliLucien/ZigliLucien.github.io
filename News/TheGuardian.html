Meanwhile, Trump advisers who know he needs at least some moderate voters to win will be hoping he can tone down his most virulent rhetoric, such as saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country”.</p><p><strong>What have the candidates been saying ahead of the debate?</strong> Trump has unleashed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/26/trump-biden-presidential-debate">a fusillade of baseless accusations</a> against Biden and CNN moderators in a familiar rehash of tactics used in previous campaigns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/27/first-thing-biden-and-trump-prepare-for-tv-debate">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
