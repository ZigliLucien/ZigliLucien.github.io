Among those: weakening the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), ending policies that consider the effects of climate change – and eliminating the US dietary guidelines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/15/project-2025-food-farming-policies">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

About 7,000 students from the class of 2028 will be affected this year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/15/california-university-ucsd-climate-change-course-requirement">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
