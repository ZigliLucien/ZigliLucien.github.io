 The prosecutor’s office in the western city of Mendoza – where the alleged assault took place last Sunday following the French team’s test match against the Argentinian Pumas – ordered the two players, Oscar Jegou and Hugo Auradou, to remain in detention until trial. <br><br>
 After being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/09/france-hugo-auradou-and-oscar-jegou-arrested-on-sexual-assault-charges-rugby-union">arrested in Buenos Aires</a>, Jegou, 21, and Auradou, 20, were transferred 1,000km (620 miles) to Mendoza on Thursday for their first court appearance. They chose not to testify in Friday’s hearing. <br><br>
 The French Rugby Federation had previously said that the players admitted to having consensual sex with the alleged victim and denied any acts of violence. <br><br>
 The prosecutors said the court would soon decide whether to grant the defendants’ request for house arrest. <br><br>
 The account of the assault – provided by Natacha Romano, the lawyer of the victim – has drawn outrage in France and caused a stir in Argentina, where recent scandals involving professional athletes have prompted questions within the greater sports community about misogyny and sexual violence. <br><br>
 The woman says that after meeting the players at a nightclub, she was taken to their hotel room and subjected to violent, non-consensual sexual acts and prevented from leaving. After escaping the hotel room, Romano said the victim filed a police complaint and underwent physical examinations. <br><br>
 The charges of aggravated sexual assault in Argentina carry the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The mandatory minimum is eight years. <br><br>
 Authorities said that they would move the defendants to another jail later on Friday.</p><p><em>Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.
