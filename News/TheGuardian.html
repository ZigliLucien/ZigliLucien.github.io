Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks and trees. More than 10 people were injured and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected.</p><p>Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/weather-tracker-indonesia-flash-floods-landslides-dozens-dead-sumatra">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

 Jim Himes, Joe Courtney and John Larson all reported that their homes were the subject of bomb threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of a bomb on the lawmakers’ properties.<br><br>
 This happened a day after a number of Donald Trump’s most prominent cabinet picks and appointees reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-cabinet-bomb-threats">they had received bomb threats and “swatting attacks”</a>, in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretences.<br><br>
 Courtney’s Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said.<br><br>
 Himes said on Thursday morning he was notified of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The US Capitol police and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded.<br><br>
 Himes extended his family’s “utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety”. He added: “There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.”<br><br>
 Larson also said on Thursday that East Hartford police responded to a bomb threat against his home.<br><br>
 The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/trump-safe-gunshots-golf-course">a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally</a> in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing him in the ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/trump-assassination-attempt-suspect-not-guilty">a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course</a> in Florida, when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing.<br><br>
 Among those who received threats on Wednesday were New York representative Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the next ambassador to the UN; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/28/bomb-threats-target-democratic-congress-members-from-connecticut">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
