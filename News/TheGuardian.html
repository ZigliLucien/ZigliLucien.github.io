Milton has the potential to become “one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida”, the National Hurricane Center said.</p><p><strong>What are the hardships facing those evacuating? </strong>For some, fleeing home to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/hurricane-milton-evacuation-logistics">avoid a disaster is simply not possible</a>. The Federal Reserve has estimated that nearly 40% of Americans would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense in cash, while a 2021 study found that people who evacuated from the Texas Coastal Bend during Hurricane Harvey spent about <a href="https://southerlymag.org/2021/06/23/people-are-wiped-out-costs-pile-up-as-hurricane-season-begins/">$1,200 on average</a> on evacuating – more if they had to stay in hotels.</p><p><strong>What have local officials done to ease evacuation efforts?</strong> Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, lifted tolls on major highways and ordered breakdown lanes open but traffic levels were still above 150% of normal, with accidents blocking some routes. “Unfortunately every storm we see traffic fatalities because people wait until the last minute to leave,” Florida’s transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said.</p><p><strong>How has Trump responded to the allegations?</strong> Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said: “None of these madeup stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man … clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/first-thing-the-scramble-to-flee-florida-ahead-of-hurricane-milton">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
