In October 2021, a boat carrying dozens of Tamils trying to find their way to Canada sprung a leak. They were rescued by the British navy and brought to Diego Garcia, a tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that was under the control of the British government, and which hosted a US military base. But their saviours became their captors – and they found themselves in rat-infested camps, largely deprived of their liberty and caught in legal limbo with no obvious way out.</p><p>The authorities on Diego Garcia maintained that the asylum seekers were free to leave whenever they wanted, and that any restrictions on their movements there were lawful and necessary. Yesterday, a judge said that case <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/16/judge-finds-uk-unlawfully-detained-tamils-stranded-on-diego-garcia">had “not come close”</a> to being made. She ruled that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained in conditions that one of them described as “hell on earth”. The ruling amounts to a crushing defeat for the British government, and a wholesale vindication for an almost forgotten group of people whose fate has been subjugated to geopolitical forces far beyond their control.</p><p><em><strong>Espionage</strong></em> | The alleged Chinese spy with links to Prince Andrew and who made connections at the heart of the UK establishment has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/16/alleged-chinese-spy-linked-to-prince-andrew-named-as-yang-tengbo">been named as Yang Tengbo</a>, a businessman also known as Chris Yang.
