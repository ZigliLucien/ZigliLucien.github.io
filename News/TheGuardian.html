In this case, any (new) government would not get much done.</em></p><p><em><strong>Worse than gridlock:</strong> Although the united left and RN are polar opposites on issues of migration, culture and identity, they have all opposed Macron’s pro-growth reforms. As a result, we see a risk that Le Pen’s party and parts of the left may still join forces in a hung parliament on a few select issues to soften Macron’s pension reform and enhance the “purchasing power” of citizens, for instance through lower VAT on energy products or via additional subsidies.</em></p><p><em><strong>Marine Meloni:</strong> With a significantly lower probability than the first two scenarios, Le Pen’s party may still win a majority of seats and install RN boss Jordan Bardella as prime minister. If so, she would probably focus on winning the 2027 presidential election, staying on the more moderate track which she has signalled during the campaign. She may concentrate on some signature policies (e.g. being tough on immigration) rather than on expensive or disruptive fiscal promises. Put differently, Le Pen may try to largely follow the example of Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni. To do so, she may possibly explain to RN voters after a lengthy fiscal review that most of her original fiscal ideas could only be implemented slowly over time – or only if she became president in 2027.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jul/01/euro-dollar-sterling-bond-markets-france-election-marine-le-pen-french-hung-parliament-manufacturing-ecb-business-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The US National Weather Service has issued excessive heat warnings and heat advisories for the days between Tuesday and Saturday due to “dangerously hot conditions” with temperatures likely to soar into the triple digits fahrenheit.</p><p>Temperatures have already been building across the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys this past weekend, but will continue to rise through this week. One of the hottest cities will likely be Fresno, where maximum temperatures could exceed 110F (43C) across multiple days. Death Valley may also get close to 130F (54C) towards the end of the week; a temperature that has been reached only three times – in 1913, 2020 and 2021. Temperatures more widely will reach 100-110F (38-43C) between Tuesday and Saturday, although peak temperatures could reach 115F (46C), which would be 5-10C above the climatological average. In addition to the high daytime maximum temperatures, there won’t be much relief overnight, with minimum temperatures dropping into the mid-60s F to low-80s F (around 18C-28C).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/scorching-temperatures-across-us-threaten-heat-records">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
