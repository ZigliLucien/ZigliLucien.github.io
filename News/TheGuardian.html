So not only a large amount – so for example, a $3m fine for an offence and ongoing fines, but a percentage of turnover as well.</p><p><strong>We know that the revenues of some of these online platforms exceed those of some nations and so it needs to be a meaningful and substantial penalty system that’s put in place.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/apr/18/australia-news-live-stabbing-bondin-junction-westfield-wakeley-riot-sydney-terror-attack-anthony-albanese-daniel-andrews">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
