We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s <strong>Israel-Gaza war</strong> coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">here</a> and on the <strong>Middle East</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast">here</a>.</p><p>Here is a recap of the latest developments:</p><p><strong>Protests aimed at pressuring the Israeli government to reach a hostage deal with Hamas began across Israel on Sunday,</strong> with demonstrators blocking roads and picketing at the homes of government ministers. The demonstrators took to the streets, blocking rush hour traffic at major intersections across the country. They briefly set fire to tires on the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway before police cleared the way. Another Palestinian official, with knowledge of the ongoing ceasefire deliberations, said Israel was in talks with the Qataris. “They have discussed with them Hamas’ response and they promised to give them Israel’s response within days,” the official told Reuters on Sunday. Israel’s government made no immediate comment on the timing of its deliberations.</p><p><strong>In Gaza, Palestinian health officials said at least 15 people were killed in separate Israeli military strikes on Sunday.</strong> An Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Zawayda, in central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, killed at least six people and wounded several others, while six others were killed in an airstrike on a house in western Gaza, the health officials said. Tanks deepened their raids in central and northern areas of Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. Health officials there said they had recovered three bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the eastern part of the city.</p><p><strong>Hamas is waiting for a response from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> on its ceasefire proposal, two officials from the Palestinian group said on Sunday.</strong> This comes five days after it accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month war in Gaza. “We have left our response with the mediators and are waiting to hear the occupation’s response,” one of the two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> officials told Reuters, asking not to be named.</p><p><strong>Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement fired another 20 rockets at northern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, leaving one person injured there</strong>, the latest cross-border attacks launched in solidarity with Gaza’s Palestinian militant group Hamas. Hezbollah said that “in response to the attack and assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out”, it had targeted “one of the main bases” in northern Israel, west of Tiberias, with “dozens of Katyusha rockets”.</p><p><strong>At least 38,153 Palestinians have been killed and 87,828 injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7,</strong> Gaza’s health ministry said on Sunday.</p><p><strong>Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/06/iran-reformist-masoud-pezeshkian-extends-lead-in-presidential-election-count">won Iran’s runoff presidential election</a>,</strong> beating hardliner Saeed Jalili by promising to reach out to the west and ease enforcement on the country’s mandatory headscarf law after years of sanctions and protests squeezing the Islamic Republic.</p><p><strong>The British Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond was returning to Portsmouth on Saturday after six months in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden </strong>helping to protect shipping from attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The warship shot down nine drones and a Houthi missile, sailing nearly 44,000 miles (71,000km) and spending 151 days at sea, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jul/07/israel-gaza-war-live-live-news-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
