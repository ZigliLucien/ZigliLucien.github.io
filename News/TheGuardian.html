Last night, both sides appeared to have accepted the outlines of a deal, with Reuters reporting that once Israel delivers maps showing how its forces will withdraw from Gaza, Hamas will give its response.</p><p>“It’s closer than it’s ever been before,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said yesterday. “But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we’ll remain on the brink.”</p><p><em><strong>Economy</strong></em> | UK inflation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/15/surprise-fall-in-uk-inflation-to-25-eases-pressure-on-rachel-reeves">unexpectedly fell in December</a>, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after a week of turbulence in financial markets.
