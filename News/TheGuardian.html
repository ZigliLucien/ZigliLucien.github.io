Plus, ICJ set to rule on Israel’s Gaza offensive</p><p>Good morning,</p><p>Senate Democrats have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/23/trump-oil-industry-money-investigation">launched an investigation</a> into an alleged quid pro quo offer from Donald Trump to fossil fuel executives. At a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago home and club last month, the former president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/09/trump-oil-ceo-donation">reportedly told</a> oil bosses he would immediately roll back dozens of environmental regulations if elected, and requested $1bn in contributions to his campaign. It would be a “deal” for the executives because of the costs they would avoid under him, he reportedly said.</p><p><strong>What did the senators say?</strong> “As Mr Trump funnels campaign money into his businesses and uses it as a slush fund to pay his legal fees, big oil has been lobbying aggressively to protect and expand its profits at the expense of the American taxpayer,” they wrote.</p><p><strong>Meanwhile, what’s Trump doing?</strong> He’s continued to ask fossil fuel companies for campaign funding amid scrutiny of his relationship with the industry. On Wednesday he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/trump-oil-industry-campaign">joined a fundraiser</a> hosted by three oil bosses at a five-star hotel in Houston, including two from companies reportedly involved in the Mar-a-Lago meeting.</p><p><strong>What could be the ICJ ruling’s impact?</strong> ICJ decisions have in the past been ignored, as the top UN legal body has no way to enforce its decisions, but they carry international weight. A ruling against Israel could add to its political isolation after a series of setbacks this week. Israel says it would defy any order to stop fighting.</p><p><strong>Is this </strong><strong>different from the ICC arrest warrants case?</strong> Yes. The ICJ and ICC, although both located in The Hague, are different bodies. The US is not a signatory to the ICC but does recognize the ICJ, which is part of the UN.</p><p><strong>What is the humanitarian toll of the war?</strong> After Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage on 7 October, Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed 36,000 Palestinians – mostly women and children – and decimated the strip’s infrastructure, displacing about 80% of the population.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/24/first-thing-senate-investigates-trumps-reported-deal-with-oil-companies">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
