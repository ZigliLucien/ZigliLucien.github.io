We need to do better. There’s no question about that.</strong></p><p>We need to look at bail laws. <strong>More importantly,</strong> <strong>we actually need to look at how we can keep women, or victims and children in the home environment and force the perpetrator to leave.</strong> We have a program in NSW called the Staying Home: Leave Violence program. There are over 138 LGAs in this state at the moment, only 91 have access to that program, even though we know it is incredibly effective. We need programs like that funded immediately, not just across NSW but across the country.</p><p>I am optimistic about who we are as a country and our capacity to take responsibility for ourselves. The time of us to do this is now. <strong>We don’t have three months, which is what the government is suggesting, to wait and see what happens next.
