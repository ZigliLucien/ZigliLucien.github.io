She is expected to cast Trump as a divisive figure who will spend his term consumed by vengeance, leveraging the power of the presidency against his political enemies rather than in service of the American people.</p><p><strong>Don’t miss important US election coverage. <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/kamala-harris-turn-the-page-trump">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
