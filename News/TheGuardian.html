In excerpts of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-zelenskyy-ukraines-war-russia-closer-end-appeals/story?id=113936136">an interview</a> with ABC News’ Good Morning America, set to be broadcast in full on Tuesday, the president said: “I think that we are closer to the peace than we think … We are closer to the end of the war.” He added: “That’s why we’re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It’s very important.” Zelenskyy told ABC that Vladimir Putin is “afraid” of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/revealed-russia-anticipated-kursk-incursion-months-in-advance-seized-papers-show">Ukraine’s Kursk operation</a>, in which it has taken more than 1,000 square km of Russian territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy is in the US to attend sessions at the UN general assembly as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/biden-letting-ukraine-strike-deep-within-russia-key-to-ending-war-zelenskyy-says">to present a “victory plan”</a> to US President Joe Biden and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.</p><p><strong>After a bipartisan meeting with members of the US Congress, Zelenskyy said “decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year”.</strong> The US played a “critical role” in protecting freedom around the world, he said in a Telegram post, and praised the US Congress and both main parties for their “unwavering commitment to this cause”.</p><p><strong>His comments came as Republican presidential candidate Trump suggested Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the November election</strong>. “I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,” Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. “He wants them [the Democrats] to win this election so badly.” Trump said if he wins the election, he would call Putin and Zelenskyy and urge them to reach a deal to end the war.</p><p><strong>Zelenskyy also held talks in New York with German, Indian and Japanese leaders on Monday trying to shore up support for Kyiv’s war efforts.</strong> “We talked about how to make a just peace closer,” Zelenskiy said on his Telegram messaging app after meeting with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. “The main thing is to maintain unity.” He said he had discussed energy aid with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and that Delhi and Kyiv were “dynamically developing” their relations after a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi.</p><p><strong>Jails controlled by Russia are deliberately withholding medical care for Ukrainian prisoners, with doctors in one prison even taking part in what it called “torture”, according to a commission mandated by the UN rights council</strong>. The commission, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, had already concluded that Moscow’s occupying forces were using torture “systematically”. But in his oral report to the council, commission chair Erik Mose said torture had become a “common and acceptable practice”, with Russian authorities acting with “a sense of impunity”.</p><p><strong>Russian forces launched the latest of a series of strikes on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday evening, killing one person, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said</strong>. A city official, quoted by public broadcaster Suspilne, put the injury toll at five, including a 13-year-old girl. Strikes on the city earlier in the day and the previous night wounded at least 23.</p><p><strong>Russian forces have begun storming the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a stronghold that has resisted Russian attack since the beginning of the war, according to Russian war bloggers and state media</strong>. Russian state media said the hilltop town in the Donetsk region, which some cast as a fortress due to its enduring resistance to Russian attack, was caught in a pincer movement by Russian forces and that battles were under way in the east of the settlement.</p><p><strong>Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UN general assembly,</strong> <strong>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said</strong> <strong>it was clear that Russia was receiving new weapons, including Iranian missiles despite Tehran’s repeated denials.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The headline says: “The writing is already on the wall for Labour’s floundering government.” In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Curtice distanced himself from that headline, saying “floundering” wasn’t what he wrote. But his assessment in the article is still quite negative.</p><p>Curtice said that Labour won the election, not because voters were enthusiastic about the party, but because they were determined to get rid of the Tories. Reform UK, not Labour, gained most from this, he said. He went on:</p><p>Nearly one in four 2019 Conservative voters switched to Reform compared with just one in eight who backed Labour.</p><p>As a result, Labour won just 35 per cent of the vote – in an election where only three in five voted. Never before has a party won an overall majority with so low a share of the vote. Consequently, the pool of voters willing to give it the benefit of the doubt is unusually small.</p><p>The trouble is, Sir Keir entered 10 Downing St having conspicuously failed – in contrast to Tony Blair or David Cameron – over the previous four years to impress himself favourably on voters. It was never going to take much of a slip for Sir Keir’s post-election halo of success to disappear.</p><p>One key weakness underlay his lack of popularity before entering office – an apparent inability to articulate a clear vision of the kind of country he wants to create. <a href="https://archive.is/o/8G5jU/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/07/05/labour-party-pledges-manifesto-general-election-voters/">Labour’s slogan in July was “Change”</a> – and at this week’s conference it is “Change Begins”. Neither makes the intended destination clear.</p><p>The truth is that if we take tough long-term decisions now, if we stick to the driving purpose behind everything we do: higher economic growth - so living standards rise in every community; our NHS facing the future - waiting lists at your hospital down; safer streets in your community; stronger borders; more opportunities for your children; clean British energy powering your home; making our country more secure ... then that light at the end of this tunnel, that Britain that belongs to you, we get there much more quickly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
