Such actions, the doctrine says, will be considered a joint attack.</p><p>In addition, a nuclear response from Russia is possible in the event of a critical threat to its sovereignty, even with conventional weapons, in the event of an attack on Belarus as a member of the Union State, [or] in the event of a massive launch of military aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, other aircraft and their crossing the Russian border.</p><p>Each time these discussions about an individual weapon type are considered, freighted with great significance, the reality has been they’ve only made an incremental difference in the battlefield. From Ukraine’s perspective, it is better to have them than not, but ultimately, no single weapon type is decisive in a complex war like this.</p><p>Each of these weapons comes along months, maybe years, after Ukrainians asked for them. It’s quite an agonising process. They are clearly military useful, they have a psychological and deterrent effect but in terms of an actual destructive effect, not so much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
