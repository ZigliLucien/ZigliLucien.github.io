She was the sixth candidate to declare (the others are Tom Tugendhat, James Cleverly, Mel Stride, Priti Patel and Robert Jenrick), and no one else is expected to come forward before the deadline for nominations closes this afternoon. Badenoch is the bookmakers’ favourite, and her article is less platitudinous than some of the equivalent ones from her rivals. Here are the main points.</p><p><strong>Badenoch says the Tories deserved to lose the general election. </strong>She says:</p><p>The electorate did not make a mistake. We deserved to lose because the past decade saw us twist and turn in the wind, unsure of who we were, what we were for and how we could build a new country …</p><p>Some will argue our loss was down to this policy, that person or some decision. The truth is our policy offer was incoherent, and we could not articulate why conservatism should matter to our fellow man. We thought we could just be managerially better at governing than the other side – a weak foundation at the best of times. Too often, we were led by focus groups.</p><p><strong>She says the last Tory government was too leftwing. </strong>“We talked right yet governed left,” she says. In particular, it was too liberal, she argues.</p><p>We sought to build an increasingly liberal society. But liberalism has been hacked. Our empathy with those fleeing persecution has been exploited to create an asylum system that is effectively open borders to anyone willing to lie about their circumstances. Legislative improvements ensuring that everyone can be treated equally, irrespective of their race, sex or religion have morphed into a nasty identity politics that seeks to divide based on these characteristics.</p><p>Under the guise of politeness and good manners, free speech and the freedom to dissent is curtailed, exemplified by Labour scrapping the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act. In its place we have a coarsening of language and promotion of a postmodernism that can best be described as joyless decadence. We must renew.</p><p><strong>Badenoch says the Conservative party needs to rediscover what it stands for.</strong> She says:</p><p>It would be easy to give in to the fatigue we all feel. To just focus on being a credible opposition or lose ourselves debating individual policy positions, as if we remain in government. But there is a bigger question of what it means to be a conservative today. If there wasn’t, the Reform party would not exist. It is not enough to call for “unity to win”. We need to ask ourselves, what are we uniting around? What are we winning for?</p><p><strong>Badenoch says she wants the state to do less than it does now.</strong> She says:</p><p>We will renew by starting from first principles: we can’t control immigration until we reconfirm our belief in the nation state and the sovereign duty it has, above all else, to serve its own citizens. Our public services will never fully recover from the pandemic until we remember that government should do some things well, not everything badly.</p><p><strong>She says she wants to renew capitalism. </strong>She says:</p><p>The wealth of our nation is built upon our historic ability to capture the ingenuity and industry of our people, and the willingness of many to trade risk for reward. It’s become a dirty word, but our renewal must also mean a renewal for capitalism.</p><p><strong>She suggests she wants to let members play a bigger role in making policy. She says:</strong></p><p>Presidential politics don’t work in the UK. Conservatism must become a team effort once again as we renew our party from top to bottom. A new respect for our members who, in their daily lives, are the backbone of communities across our country but are sneered at and pilloried by elitist commentators. We need to do right by our local councillors, many who ran successful councils but lost their seats because of behaviours in parliament.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/jul/29/rachel-reeves-statement-treasury-taxes-public-finances-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
