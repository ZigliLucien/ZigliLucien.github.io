(“Growing up, Goodfellas taught us a lot,” he added. “It was <em>helpful</em>.”) He set the stage for the event by expressing everything Mean Streets means and has meant to him, part of the longstanding mutual admiration between gangster cinema and hip-hop. As a restless young man in search of a dollar wherever he could get it, he saw an aspirational figure in De Niro’s hot-tempered hustler Johnny Boy, and as a budding artist using the modest means available to convey his raw vision of authentic drama at street-level, he came to see himself in Scorsese. The film, released exactly one month after Nas’ birth, “taps into something fundamental about the city’s essence, the hustle, the spirit,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/17/to-me-manhattan-is-the-universe-scorsese-and-de-niro-reunite-on-stage">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

 The blaze, named the Post Fire, started Saturday and was burning near the Interstate 5 freeway in Gorman, about 62 miles (100km) north-west of Los Angeles, according to the California department of forestry and fire protection.<br><br>
 California state park services evacuated 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley recreation area in Gorman and both Hungry Valley and the Pyramid Lake reservoir were closed as a result of the fire threat, the Los Angeles county fire department said.<br><br>
 The flames broke out at around 1.45pm, authorities said. The cause isn’t known.<br><br>
 No homes were threatened by the fire but two commercial buildings have been damaged, the Los Angeles county fire department said Sunday.<br><br>
 The fire was moving south-east toward Pyramid Lake and crews were constructing perimeter fire lines while aircraft worked against limited visibility to stop the fire’s progress, the fire department said. Fire lines had been built around 2% of the perimeter as of Sunday morning, the Los Angeles county fire department said.<br><br>
 Strong winds will impact firefighting efforts, especially after 8pm, the department said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/16/california-post-fire-evacuation">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
