We have a sensible proposition to put to the Australian people and I know that when we talk about nuclear people are starting to tune in, understanding that <strong>if 19 of the 20 biggest economies in the world are using nuclear, if it makes sense for cleaner baseload power, because it’s zero emissions, if it helps us get to 2050 net zero, if it does all of the things that we want it to do in terms of emissions, and in terms of securing affordable cheaper power for Australians … why would people not consider it?</strong> And I believe they will.</p><p>Now, the government says it’s renewables only. We can see that that’s actually not going to happen. The government talks about hydrogen, it’s not at scale. It’s not even something they can demonstrate works in that short timeframe and they talk about batteries that aren’t going to provide the storage for their renewables.</p><p>So, they are in a complete mess over this, and they need to be put on the sticky paper and asked what they are going to do for families, households and manufacturing businesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/jun/19/australia-news-live-peter-dutton-nuclear-coalition-china-south-sea-li-qiang-anthony-albanese-renewable-energy">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
