You can read more on the US presidential debates here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/15/biden-trump-debate-date">Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree to two US presidential debates</a></li></ul><p>In a letter to <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s re-election campaign, top <strong>Donald Trump</strong> advisers <strong>Chris LaCivita</strong> and <strong>Susie Wiles</strong> said the former president had accepted their invitation to participate in two debates, while demanding further face offs between the two candidates.</p><p>“Today is a good day for America’s voters, now that Joe Biden has FINALLY accepted President Trump’s debate challenge. President Trump and our campaign have been requesting this for months with a consistent message: ANY TIME! ANYWHERE! ANY PLACE!” Wiles and LaCivita write.</p><p>We believe there should be more than just two opportunities for the American people to hear more from the candidates themselves. With the soaring inflation of Bidenomics costing America’s hardworking families at the grocery store and at the gas pump, with our border being totally overrun, with chaos at home, chaos across the world, chaos on our college campuses, we should have one debate per month.</p><p>Therefore, we propose a debate in June, a debate in July, a debate in August, and a debate in September, in addition to the Vice Presidential debate. Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate.</p><p>Crooked Joe Biden is the WORST debater I have ever faced - He can’t put two sentences together! Crooked is also the WORST President in the history of the United States, by far. It’s time for a debate so that he can explain to the American People his highly destructive Open Border Policy, new and ridiculous EV Mandates, the allowance of Crushing Inflation, High Taxes, and his really WEAK Foreign Policy, which is allowing the World to “Catch on Fire.” I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September. I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds - That’s only because he doesn’t get them. Just tell me when, I’ll be there. “Let’s get ready to Rumble!!!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/may/15/biden-trump-election-house-republican-democrat-politics-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
