There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. “The UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,” <strong>Serhiy Popko</strong>, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said. “The air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.”</p><p>Ukraine’s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said.</p><p>Russian media is reporting that colonel general <strong>Gennady Anashkin</strong>, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war.

They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance’s joint fight against terrorism.</p><p>Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia’s <strong>Kursk</strong> region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters.<strong> </strong>The source, who is on Ukraine’s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv’s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller.
