Even so, a Mel Stride appearance during this election has developed a strong flavour of all those mornings in Groundhog Day when Bill Murray’s clock radio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD2ZC11pPPQ">lurches into life</a> halfway through I Got You Babe.

As the long days have passed, these listeners have worked their way through all the emotions: disbelief, anger, resignation, smash radio, restart cycle. Just hearing that Stride is “joining us after the headlines” or “up next” produces a Pavlovian response: a million-yard stare and the realisation that it is the general election again – it is somehow still the general election – and, indeed, it may always and for ever be the general election.</p><p>And yet, to lightly adapt the words that <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/why-always-me-balotelli-famous-slogan-meaning-history-explained/bltb717f14c0dab3994">once graced</a> Mario Balotelli’s base layer: “WHY ALWAYS MEL?” Even broadcast interviewers playing the Sonny to Mel’s Cher have begun to ask where the rest of the cabinet are.
