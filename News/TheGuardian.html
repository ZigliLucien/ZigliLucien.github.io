On the positive side, investments in infrastructure and planning reforms should create a more business-friendly environment; an improved health service should help bring people back to work as current inactivity remains mainly linked to people who are off sick; and education and childcare investments should improve workers’ skills in the long term. Nonetheless, reaping those potential benefits will also depend on whether the spending is deployed in an effective way.</p><p>A hypothetical scenario in which public spending is permanently higher but the quality and accessibility of public services still doesn’t improve enough, could further complicate policy trade-offs in the future.
