We lowered costs for Marketplace coverage by an average of $800 per year for millions of Americans, and more Americans than ever before have signed up for health insurance through the law.</p><p>At a time when contraception access is under attack, Vice President Harris and I are resolute in our commitment to expanding access to quality, affordable contraception. We believe that women in every state must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family. We will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore reproductive freedom and safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/21/kamala-harris-donald-trump-rallies-us-election-politics">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
