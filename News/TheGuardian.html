 Salukvadze has competed at every Summer Olympics since 1988 – when she won gold as a 19-year-old Soviet citizen. She set her latest record when she stepped into the shooting range for qualification in the women’s 10m air pistol on Saturday.</p><p>Salukvadze finished 38th and didn’t advance to Sunday’s final, but she gets another chance at a medal on Friday in qualification for the 25m pistol event.<br><br>
 In a career spanning five decades, Salukvadze has competed on three different Olympic teams – first with the Soviet Union in 1988, then the Unified Team in Barcelona in 1992 after the Soviet Union collapsed. For the last eight Summer Olympics, she has represented Georgia.<br><br>
 Salukvadze was in the spotlight again in 2008, when Russia fought a brief war with Georgia during the Beijing Olympics. Salukvadze won bronze and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsshooting.olympics2008">embraced Russian silver medalist Natalia Paderina</a> on the podium in what was widely seen as a gesture for peace.<br><br>
 “Why did this gesture surprise everyone? We are athletes, there is no conflict between us,” she said at the time.<br><br>
 In 2016, Salukvadze and her son Tsotne Machavariani, who is also a pistol shooter, <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/mother-and-son-team-up-for-a-games-first">became the first mother-and-son duo</a> in Olympic history to compete at the same Games. Salukvadze had considered retiring after the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, but was persuaded to continue by her father and coach Vakhtang, who died this year.<br><br>
 Salukvadze already had the record for most Olympic appearances by a female athlete and is now tied with Canadian showjumper Ian Millar for the most for any athlete.<br><br>
 Salukvadze is the only Olympian to compete at 10 Summer Games in a row, unlike Millar, whose appearances weren’t consecutive because Canada boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/georgian-shooter-nino-salukvadze-becomes-first-10-time-female-olympian">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
