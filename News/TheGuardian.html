At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube.

It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
