Scholars must accept the principles of the ruling party of country B, and direction from country B’s government via consular staff. Depending on the circumstances, these arrangements may undermine free speech and academic freedom at University A. If so, that university is likely to have to terminate or amend the scholarship agreement.</p><p>If it means that there are people who are employed by an institute who are preventing legitimate protests or shutting down lecturers from covering certain kinds <em>of</em> content regarding that country for instance, or that country’s foreign policy … If that behaviour amounts to a restriction <em>of</em> <em>freedom</em> <em>of</em> <em>speech</em> within the law, and someone brings a complaint to us, then we may find that the complaint is justified and then we make recommendations …</p><p>If there are problems, universities will have to do everything they can to act compatibly with their <em>freedom</em>-<em>of</em>-<em>speech</em> duties. Insofar as that means a rethinking <em>of</em> their relationship with other countries, obviously that’s something that would be a good idea for them to start thinking about now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/mar/26/rishi-sunak-national-insurance-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
