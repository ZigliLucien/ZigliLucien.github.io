Citing sources, Dutch outlets NOS and RTL reported that Hungarian prime minister <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong> did not reiterate his demand for an apology from Rutte for what Orban described last month as “problematic” opinions on Hungary. The apology had been one of the two conditions Hungary had put forward for approving Rutte as the successor to <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong> at the helm of Nato. The other – the guarantee that Hungary would not have to provide funding for Ukraine or send personnel to the war-torn country – was met last week by Stoltenberg, Reuters reported.</p><p>A Russian occupation official said on Monday that fighting was gripping parts of Ukraine’s north-eastern <strong>Kharkiv</strong> region, with Ukraine’s military pouring men and equipment into the contested area. “There is fighting still going on in the Kharkiv sector. The fiercest clashes are in Vovchansk and near Lyptsy,” Vitaly Ganchev told Russian news agencies.</p><p>Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, said Ukrainian forces were gradually pushing Russian troops out of parts of Kharkiv they have fought over since May. His top commander, <strong>Oleksandr Syrskyi</strong>, predicted the Russians would try to press forward pending the arrival in Ukraine of sophisticated western equipment, including US-made F-16 fighter jets. Syrskyi also said Russian forces were concentrating their firepower on the Donetsk region, particularly on the Pokrovsk front.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jun/18/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-in-north-korea-visit-pyongyang-kim-jong-un-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
