He told listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme:</p><p>We’ve been very, very clear – even before the election was called – that we want the burden of taxes to come down on working people. That’s why we’ve supported the last two cuts to national insurance and why we’ve been consistent in saying we have no plans, no expectations to increase taxes on working people.</p><p>Of course, I would love to do lots of other things that cost lots of money, but I can’t because the Conservatives have crashed the economy, debt has gone through the roof, the cost of the national debt is a huge burden on the Treasury.</p><p>Let’s be crystal clear, in the autumn of 2022 I took the very difficult decisions, yes, to increase taxes. And now in my budget, and in the autumn statement last year, I have started to bring them down.</p><p>Have I been able to cancel out all those tax rises? No. But I can absolutely undertake that the threshold freeze that we introduced until 2028 will not continue after that. It means that we’re not going to increase it beyond the levels it is currently set at, nor national insurance. In fact, we hope to bring down national insurance.</p><p>In an election campaign, it is legitimate to be concerned about a Labour party that doesn’t seem to be able to make up its mind on these basic issues. Four times this week Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves had the chance to deny that they were going to increase VAT, and they chose not to until late last night. On national insurance cuts they said they were in favour of it, and now they say they are against further cuts to national insurance</p><p>When you have an economy that since 2010 has created more jobs, attracted more investment, and grown faster than nearly any other European economy it is a big risk to hand that to a party that can’t make up its mind on basic issues. Because when the Labour can’t make up their mind, taxes go up, as sure as night follows day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/may/30/uk-general-election-conservatives-labour-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-jeremy-hunt-politics">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
