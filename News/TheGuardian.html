 Jim Himes, Joe Courtney and John Larson all reported that their homes were the subject of bomb threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of a bomb on the lawmakers’ properties.<br><br>
 This happened a day after a number of Donald Trump’s most prominent cabinet picks and appointees reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-cabinet-bomb-threats">they had received bomb threats and “swatting attacks”</a>, in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretences.<br><br>
 Courtney’s Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said.<br><br>
 Himes said on Thursday morning he was notified of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The US Capitol police and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded.<br><br>
 Himes extended his family’s “utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety”. He added: “There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.”<br><br>
 Larson also said on Thursday that East Hartford police responded to a bomb threat against his home.<br><br>
 The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/trump-safe-gunshots-golf-course">a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally</a> in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing him in the ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/trump-assassination-attempt-suspect-not-guilty">a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf course</a> in Florida, when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing.<br><br>
 Among those who received threats on Wednesday were New York representative Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the next ambassador to the UN; Matt Gaetz, Trump’s initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/28/bomb-threats-target-democratic-congress-members-from-connecticut">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
