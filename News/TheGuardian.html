What we know on day 884</p><p><strong>The Pentagon has found $2bn worth of additional errors in its calculations for ammunition, missiles and other equipment sent to Ukraine</strong>, increasing the improperly valued material to a total of $8.2bn, a US government report revealed on Thursday. In 2023, the Pentagon said staff used “replacement value” instead of “depreciated value” to tabulate the billions in materials sent to Ukraine. The $6.2bn error created a path for billions more to be sent to Kyiv.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has called on Hong Kong to prevent Russia and Russian businesses from using the region to circumvent sanctions</strong>. Kuleba met with Hong Kong leader John Lee as part of a visit to China. He called on the administration to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong to circumvent restrictions resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine, according to a statement from the Ukrainian foreign affairs ministry. “These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s potential to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” the statement said.</p><p><strong>Russia attacked Ukrainian energy facilities in two regions with drones, causing disruptions to electricity supplies</strong>, the national power grid operator said on Friday. Ukrenergo said power supplies had been already restored to most consumers in the northern Chernihiv and Zhytomyr regions. Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector have intensified since the spring, resulting in blackouts in many regions and forcing Kyiv to start large-scale electricity imports from the European Union.</p><p><strong>A court in Moscow on Thursday ordered the head of a defense ministry’s construction division to be detained for two months</strong> on suspicion of abuse of power, Russian news agencies reported, the latest in a series of arrests of high-ranking ministry officials this year. Andrei Belkov heads the Military Construction Company, which builds bases, hospitals, schools and other facilities for the military, according to its website.</p><p><strong>Russian and Chinese bombers flew together for the first time in international airspace off the coast of Alaska</strong>, in a new show of expanding military cooperation that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday raises concerns. The flights Wednesday were not seen as a threat but it was the first time that Chinese bomber aircraft have flown within the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone. And it was the first time Chinese and Russian aircraft have taken off from the same base in northeast Russia.</p><p><strong>The Turkish navy intercepted a marine drone in the Black Sea off Istanbul</strong>, authorities said, with media reporting that it contained explosives and might be Ukrainian. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of <strong>Ukraine</strong> in February 2022, a number of mines suspected of having floated down from the conflict zone have been spotted off the Turkish coast. The public prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation.</p><p><strong>Debris from what is believed to be a Russian drone landed in a rural area of Romania</strong>, the country’s Defense Ministry said Thursday, in the latest apparent incident of drone wreckage from the war in neighbouring Ukraine falling on to the Nato member’s soil.</p><p><strong>The Netherlands and Denmark are to deliver 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine</strong> “before the end of summer”, the Dutch defence minister announced Wednesday, saying Kyiv “urgently” needed more military support.
