This included an incident when staff were oblivious to a prisoner in crisis who had self-harmed in his cell until inspectors brought it to their attention.</p><p>Increasing overall rates of violence, including serious assaults, and higher use of force than at most other reception jails.</p><p>More than half of men saying it was easy to get drugs. The smell of cannabis was ubiquitous, the report said. The most recent tests found 44% of prisoners were using drugs.</p><p>Severe overcrowding, with 80% of men sharing cells designed to hold one person. Living conditions were very poor, with damaged flooring and furniture, broken windows and leaking fixtures being common, the report said. Many cells had no screening around the toilet, despite holding two men.</p><p>Poor maintenance and filthy conditions. At the time of the inspection, the prison had more than 900 outstanding jobs in its facilities log, inspectors said. The prison was dirty, with persistent vermin problems, and inspectors found rodent faeces and urine in cells.</p><p>About three-quarters of men claiming to spend more than 22 hours a day in their cells. Inspectors carrying out two random roll checks were unable to verify this because record-keeping was so poor.</p><p>Managers not being able to account for prisoners during the working day, despite the terror suspect Daniel Khalife’s escape from the south London prison in September. Khalife was recaptured three days later.</p><p>Most leaders at the prison being temporarily promoted, and new staff learning from inexperienced frontline managers.</p><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
