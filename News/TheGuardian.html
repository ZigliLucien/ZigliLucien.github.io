When he was asked about the report in an interview, <strong>David Lammy</strong> said the UK’s position had not changed. “We are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,” he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy.</p><p>Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area <strong>half the size of Greater London</strong> over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow’s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. “Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,” independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said.</p><p>Ambassadors from <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Nato’s</strong> 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/putin-says-russia-fired-experimental-ballistic-missile-into-ukraine">firing last week</a> of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new <strong>Oreshnik</strong> missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato’s earlier insistence that Moscow’s deployment of the new weaponry will not “deter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine”.</p><p>A new Nato mission located in <strong>Wiesbaden</strong> will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU – Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine – has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump. Europeans will step up military support for Ukraine, Pistorius pledged, after talks in Berlin with his British, French, Italian and Polish counterparts. “Our target must be to enable Ukraine to act out of a position of strength,” Pistorius said after hosting a meeting of the five leading nations in European defence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-record-russian-drones-ukraine-kyiv-nato">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
