The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_84fd8896-d3e0-40bb-ac16-14475454f836">a lull in the fighting yesterday</a>, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war.</p><p>Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control.
