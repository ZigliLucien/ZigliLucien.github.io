Files, a plugin for Cockpit that allows file management on your server

Cockpit Files was initially started by Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
student <a href="https://github.com/MahmoudHamdy02">Mahmoud Hamdy</a>
and is now under active development by the Cockpit team. The goal is
to replace the functionality of the <a
href="https://github.com/45drives/cockpit-navigator/">cockpit-navigator</a>
plugin from 45Drives and include automated testing per commit, a
standard PatternFly-based interface, and consistency with the rest of
Cockpit.

<p>Development builds for Fedora are available via <a

CentOS Linux&nbsp;7 was allowed to serve out its

there's no direct upgrade path. Users and organizations looking for a lifeline might want to consider
AlmaLinux's <a href="https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/">ELevate</a>
