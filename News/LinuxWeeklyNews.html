Specifically, the SIG is looking for guidance on whether pre-trained weights for

<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">license approved</a> by the
<a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI),
does it matter what data the models were trained on? The issue was quickly

writes</a> about the current problems with writing secure C++,
and his personal opinion on next steps to address this while maintaining
backward compatibility.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<strong>If there were 90-98% fewer C++ type/bounds/initialization/lifetime
vulnerabilities we wouldn't be having this discussion.</strong> All languages have CVEs,
C++ just has more (and C still more); so far in 2024,
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=rust">
Rust has 6 CVEs</a>, and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=c++">
C and C++ combined have 61 CVEs</a>. So zero isn't the goal; something like a 90%
reduction is necessary, and a 98% reduction is sufficient, to achieve security
parity with the levels of language safety provided by MSLs [memory-safe languages]… and has the strong
benefit that I believe it can be achieved with <em>perfect backward link
compatibility</em> (i.e., without changing C++'s object model, and its lifetime
model which does not depend on universal tracing garbage collection and is not
limited to tree-based data structures) which is essential to our being able to
adopt the improvements in existing C++ projects as easily as we can adopt other
new editions of C++. — After that, we can pursue additional improvements to
other buckets, such as thread safety and overflow safety.

Serialization is the process of transforming Python objects into a sequence of

<tt>pickle</tt></a> is Python's native serialization module. It can store complex Python

custom serialization code. For example, <tt>pickle</tt> is an integral component of
<a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/ml-file-formats">several file

	The technique works because although silicon looks opaque at

	this wavelength; thus, IRIS is a low-cost and effective technique
	for confirming the construction of chips down to block level. For
	example, IRIS can readily help determine if a chip has the correct
	amount of RAM, number of CPU cores, peripherals, bond pads,
