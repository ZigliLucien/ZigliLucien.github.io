blog post</a> to answer questions that users have raised since the release of <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/989629/">Vanilla OS 2</a>. The post has information about the update strategy for the distribution,
an <a href="https://vanillaos.org/enterprise-support">enterprise
version with support</a>, and plans for an experimental version called
Vanilla OS Vision.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>We are not planning for a potential Vanilla OS 3 because it is not
yet necessary. As previously explained, our focus right now is on bug
fixing and making the system as solid as possible, especially in light
of collaborations with OEMs. We're all excited about laying the
foundation for a third version of Vanilla OS, but we have
responsibilities to attend to first.</p>

<p>This does not mean that there will never be one, nor does it mean
that Orchid will become stagnant. On the contrary, as previously
mentioned, our updates not only bring fixes but also updates to system
components, improvements to existing features, and updates to
components like GNOME (we are planning the release of GNOME 47 soon,
for example).</p>
