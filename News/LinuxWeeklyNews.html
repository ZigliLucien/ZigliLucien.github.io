Danilo Krummrich gave a talk at Kangrejos 2024 focusing on the question of how
the Rust-for-Linux project could improve at getting device and driver
abstractions upstream. As a case study, he used some of his recent work that
attempts to make it possible to write a PCI driver entirely in Rust. There
wasn't time to go into as much detail as he would have liked, but he did
demonstrate that it is possible to interface with the kernel's module loader in
a way that is much harder to
screw up than the current standard approach in C.

<blockquote class="bq">
Countering the threat of global mass surveillance and censorship to a free Internet, Tor and Tails provide essential tools to help people around the world stay safe online. By joining forces, these two privacy advocates will pool their resources to focus on what matters most: ensuring that activists, journalists, other at-risk and everyday users will have access to improved digital security tools.
<p>
In late 2023, Tails approached the Tor Project with the idea of merging operations. Tails had outgrown its existing structure. Rather than expanding Tails's operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its larger and established operational framework, offered a solution. By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of The Tor Project.

href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">a
post on the Google Security Blog</a> on how switching to a memory-safe
language can quickly reduce vulnerabilities in a project, even if a large
body of older code persists.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	 This leads to two important takeaways:
<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
    <li> The problem is overwhelmingly with new code, necessitating a
    fundamental change in how we develop code. 
    <li> Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially, making the
    returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets
    older.
</ul>
<p>
For example, based on the average vulnerability lifetimes, 5-year-old code
has a 3.4x (using lifetimes from the study) to 7.4x (using lifetimes
observed in Android and Chromium) lower vulnerability density than new
code.
