lengthy discussion</a> about changing the rules (that some find counterintuitive) on
using <tt>break</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>, or <tt>return</tt> statements in
<tt>finally</tt> blocks. These are all ways of jumping out of a <tt>finally</tt>
block, which can interrupt the handling of a raised exception.
At the time, the Python developers chose not to change
things, because the consensus was that the existing behavior was not a problem. Now, after
<a href="https://github.com/iritkatriel/finally/blob/main/README.md">a

A compromised release was uploaded to PyPI after a project automatically processed a pull request with a flawed script.
The GitHub account 
<a href="https://github.com/openimbot">
"OpenIM Robot"</a>
(which appears to be controlled by
<a href="https://nsddd.top/">Xinwei Xiong</a>) opened
<a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/18018">a pull request</a> for the 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/">
ultralytics</a>
Python package. The pull request included a suspicious Git branch name:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq" style="">

</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, ultralytics uses the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target"><tt>pull_request_target</tt></a> GitHub Action trigger to automate some of its continuous-integration tasks. This runs a script from the base branch of the repository, which has access to the repository's secrets — but that script was vulnerable to a shell injection attack from the branch name of the pull request. The injected script appears to have used the credentials it had access to in order to compromise a later release uploaded to PyPI to include a cryptocurrency miner. It is hard to be sure of the details, because GitHub has already removed the malicious script.
</p>

<p>
This problem has been
<a href="https://nathandavison.com/blog/github-actions-and-the-threat-of-malicious-pull-requests">known</a> for several years, but this event may serve as a good reminder to be careful with automated access to important secrets.

<blockquote class="bq">
	Apertis relies on the Debian Free Software Guidelines to ensure all
	software shipped is open source or, in limited cases, at least
	freely distributable. However, for some customers this is not
	enough to be able to adopt OSS solutions as in their evaluations
	some provisions in common licenses like the GPL-3 are at odds with
	regulatory constraints they are subject to. Apertis does not set to
	solve this decades-long debate, and instead its goal is to increase
	the adoption of modern, maintained OSS solutions in markets where
	this has historically been a challenge. To enable this, Apertis
	supports avoiding the use of any software under some licenses (like
	the [GPL v3.0 license family) on target images, while still making
	them fully available for development and for customers that do not
	share those licensing concerns. To avoid these licenses, Apertis
	uses more modern alternatives instead of relying on outdated and
	unmaintained pre-GPL-3 versions. For instance, coreutils and
	findutils (GPL-3+) are replaced in Apertis by rust-coreutils and
	rust-findutils.
