provides insights into user profiles, typical usage, how the FreeBSD
project is viewed, as well as recommendations for expanding the
FreeBSD community and contributor base:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Currently fewer than half of users consider FreeBSD their daily
driver; Individuals are less likely than Corporate Users to consider
FreeBSD primary. The barrier seems to be less about software and more
about hardware support, particularly around Wi-Fi drivers (which are
at the top of the wish list for the Foundation to focus on in the
coming year). A relatively high number of those who don't consider
FreeBSD their main OS say they would consider doing so with hardware
support for desktops and laptops that was equivalent to Linux.
