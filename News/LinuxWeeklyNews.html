<a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>.
Andres Freund
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/20240329155126.kjjfduxw2yrlxgzm@awork3.anarazel.de/">
discovered</a> the backdoor by
noticing that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967194/">failed SSH logins were taking a lot of
CPU time</a> while doing some
micro-benchmarking, and tracking down the backdoor from there. It was introduced
by XZ co-maintainer "Jia Tan" — a probable alias for person or persons unknown.
The backdoor is a sophisticated attack with multiple parts, from the build
system, to link time, to run time.

	For our openSUSE Tumbleweed users where SSH is exposed to the
