href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/">posted
an article</a> announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.
<p>
	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<blockquote class="bq">
We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure.
Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations.

June 16, the first major release of the widely

there are performance improvements to several individual functions. There are only a few new
features, but several backward-incompatible changes, including a change to
NumPy's numeric-promotion rules. Changes to the Python API require relatively minor changes to
Python code using the library, but the changes to the C API may be more
difficult to adapt to. In
