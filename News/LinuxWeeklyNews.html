has <a
href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/04/29/amarok-3.0-castaway-released/">announced</a>
the release of version&nbsp;3.0, which is codenamed "Castaway".  It is the first
stable version using Qt&nbsp;5 and KDE Frameworks&nbsp;5, and the first stable
release since the final Qt-4-based&nbsp;2.9.0 in 2018.
<blockquote class="bq">
The road to 3.0 has not been a short one. Much of the Qt5/KF5 porting was done in 2015 already, but finishing and polishing everything up has been a slow, sometimes ongoing and sometimes stalled process ever since. 3.0 Alpha was released in February 2021 and has been since used by many people, as have been nightly builds of git master available for various distributions. Now in the past few months, an effort was made to get everything ready for a proper 3.0 release.
<p>
Common usecases should work quite well, and in addition to fixing KF5 port
related regressions reported in pre-releases, 3.0 features many bugfixes
and implemented features for longstanding issues, the oldest such
documented being from 2009. However, with more than 20 years of development
history, it is likely that not every feature Amarok has been tested
thoroughly in the new release, and specifically some Internet services that
have changed their API in recent years are not available, at least for
now. It might well be that getting them in better state wouldn't require
huge effort, however, so if you know your way with Qt and KDE Frameworks
and your favourite Internet music service does not work with Amarok 3.0,
you are extremely welcome to join in and help!
