Jeff Xu has been working on
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20241125202021.3684919-1-jeffxu@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that makes certain mappings in a process's address space
impossible to change, sealing them against tampering. This has some potential
security benefits — mainly, making
sure that someone cannot relocate the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscall and
vDSO mappings</a> — but some kernel developers haven't
been impressed with the patches.
While the core functionality (sealing the mappings) is sound, some of the
supporting code for enabling and disabling the new feature caused concern by
going against the normal design for such things. Reviewers also questioned
how this feature would interact with checkpointing and with sandboxing.

"<q>First, I'd like to thank Equinix Metal for the years of support they gave us. They were very kind and generous with us and even if it's a shame we have to move out on a short notice, all things come to an end.</q>"

<p>
The current cost for the services, much of which is for 50TB of <strike>bandwidth</strike> data transfer
per month and a half-dozen beefy servers for running continuous-integration
(CI) jobs, comes to around $24,000 per month.  Tissoires believes that the
project should start paying for service somewhere, in order to avoid
upheaval of this sort, sometimes on short or no notice. "<q>I personally
think we better have fd.o pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors
chip in. This way, when a sponsor goes away, it's technically much simpler

being discussed there, but any move is likely to disrupt normal services
for a week or more.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
