<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds at a price that won't break the bank; you want earbuds that come with mobile app support; adaptive active noise cancellation and other audio features are major selling points for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want a pair of earbuds with industry-leading battery life; you'd rather go with name-brand options from companies like Sony or Bose.</p><p>The second-generation Jabra Elite 10s are our pick for the best earbuds out there, so it's a real shame to see this company exit the consumer headphone space. For one, these offer high-quality audio at a price tag that's lower than most name-brand offerings, and this extra discount doesn't hurt either. These come with all the features a modern user typically needs in headphones, including a powerful adaptive ANC, spatial audio, head tracking, the easy-to-use Sound Plus app for ultimate customization, and a durable and long-lasting charging case.</p><p>The battery life is about six hours between case charges, or you can get between 24 and 32 hours total when using the charging case intermittently. Bluetooth capabilities in these offer up to 32 feet of range, and you can also use the included cable and charging case to listen via wired Bluetooth LE Audio.</p>

<ul><li>Initially exclusive to Pixel 7 and newer devices, VPN by Google expanded to older Pixel models in June, but the Pixel Tablet was left out—until now.</li><li>For a brief time, the Pixel Tablet had access, even showing up on the Play Store, but a server update cut it off.</li><li>If you’ve kept or sideloaded the app, it’s back after the November Android 15 update, with automatic connection and a working settings page.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has finally rolled out its VPN service to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. If you’re on stable Android 15, you can now download it and enjoy an extra layer of security.</p><p>VPN by Google has mostly stuck to Pixel 7 and newer phones since it launched on older Pixel models last June. However, the Pixel Tablet was left out. But now, signs point to that changing soon.</p><p>The VPN service started as a standalone app but got baked into Android after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-one-vpn-will-be-sunset-later-this-year">demise of the Google One app VPN service</a>. The December 2022 Pixel Feature Drop introduced the app to the Pixel 7 and newer devices.</p><p>For a short time, the Pixel Tablet had access too—it even showed up on the Play Store. But a server-side update quickly cut it off.</p><p>If you kept access to VPN by Google or sideloaded it recently, it’s back up and running after the Android 15 November update, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/18/pixel-tablet-google-vpn/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The fact that the VPN now automatically connects after a restart and has a working settings page is a good sign. But it still leaves us wondering if full, stable support for the Pixel Tablet will have to wait until 2025.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman previously pointed out in a report for Android Authority that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/vpn-by-google-could-finally-come-to-the-pixel-tablet-in-android-15-qpr2">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 automatically downloads and installs VPN by Google on Pixel Tablets</a>.</p><p>In a surprising twist, the VPN is now fully working on the Pixel Tablet—no need for the Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1. According to 9to5Google, users who haven’t sideloaded the app can now grab it straight from the Google Play Store.</p><p>Even though Google hasn’t officially confirmed it or updated its support documents, there’s plenty of evidence that the VPN app is now available for download on devices running stable Android 15 and works as it should.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most brands are starting to roll out their flagships earlier this year; the Find X8 Pro is now available globally, the Vivo X200 is set to make its debut shortly, and other phones aren&apos;t far behind. Vivo sub-brand iQOO is also getting in on the action, launching the iQOO 13 a month early.</p><p>The iQOO 13 retains a similar design as its predecessor, but it comes with a bigger 6.82-inch panel — the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, incidentally — and you get all-new cameras at the back alongside the latest Qualcomm hardware, and a massive 6,150mAh battery with silicon-carbon tech.</p><p>Clearly, iQOO is making a habit out of delivering significant upgrades on a yearly basis, and while I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a> extensively throughout the course of 2024, the iQOO 13 is considerably better in key areas. Thankfully, what hasn&apos;t changed is the brand&apos;s value-focused positioning — the iQOO 13 is the most affordable phone powered by Qualcomm&apos;s new silicon, and that alone makes it worthy of consideration.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-pricing-and-availability"><span>iQOO 13: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DHGXtA8VaydFu877DbCM8Y" name="iqoo-13-7.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DHGXtA8VaydFu877DbCM8Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iQOO 13 was unveiled in China on October 30, and the phone made its global debut on November 28. It is now available in Indonesia, and will be making its way to India on December 3. The global variant is available in 12GB/256GB and 16GB/512GB editions, and both models feature LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>I&apos;ll have details of Indian pricing shortly, but in Indonesia, the iQOO 13 costs 9,999,000 IDR ($630) for the 12GB/256GB version, and 11,999,000 IDR ($757) for the 16GB/512GB edition.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-design"><span>iQOO 13: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ps2daR8PqVWEoViFKGxhpZ" name="iqoo-13-3.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ps2daR8PqVWEoViFKGxhpZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iQOO 13 is virtually indistinguishable to its predecessor in terms of the design. Both phones share the same overall aesthetic, and you even get the same camera island, albeit with a few minor differences. The biggest change at the back is that the LED flash module now sits within the camera island, creating a cleaner overall look.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="54ne48n4Rgay7VEZdfrRbW" name="iqoo-13-1.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/54ne48n4Rgay7VEZdfrRbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, the iQOO branding and the brand&apos;s tagline — Fascination Meets Innovation — alongside the BMW M livery is now positioned on the left. Outside of these two changes, the design is identical. The camera island is marginally bigger on the iQOO 13, but you&apos;ll only notice that if you&apos;re using it alongside the iQOO 12.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="59YxRfDYp8fRsgFVkxjoiX" name="iqoo-13-5.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59YxRfDYp8fRsgFVkxjoiX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t mind that iQOO retained the same design this time; the iQOO 13 looks just as elegant as its predecessor, and the white color variant (it&apos;s called Legend) is striking. While the phone still has flat sides, it has subtle bevels where it meets the back, and that makes using the phone much more comfortable. It&apos;s a small thing, but you easily notice the difference when switching between the iQOO 12 and 13.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5fm6keLdTxr9kZmt6CXyWY" name="iqoo-13-11.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fm6keLdTxr9kZmt6CXyWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides are made out of aluminum, and the glossy coat isn&apos;t to my liking. Thankfully, the glass back has a matte texture that feels great, and it doesn&apos;t pick up smudges. The phone itself is a smidgen wider than the iQOO 12, and that&apos;s because it has a larger 6.82-inch panel. Considering the increase in size, it&apos;s good to see iQOO retaining similar dimensions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xWjChLyEkBQVkeo8stxWvY" name="iqoo-13-8.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xWjChLyEkBQVkeo8stxWvY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the most impressive achievement is that the phone is 0.4mm thinner while still featuring a massive 6,150mAh battery — 1,150mAh more than the iQOO 12. It is 10g heavier, and while you notice the added heft, it isn&apos;t unwieldy, and it&apos;s still 8g lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro XL while giving you a much bigger battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8DzYtdR6nLqABzzLEyPzxW" name="iqoo-13-9.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8DzYtdR6nLqABzzLEyPzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are on the right, and you get the USB-C port and SIM card tray at the bottom. The iQOO 13 has stereo sound, and you get a dedicated channel up top that makes a considerable difference. The IR blaster is also located at the top, and it holds up just as well as other Vivo and iQOO phones I used.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cVeSupdPk5DWFiDjECowLX" name="iqoo-13-10.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVeSupdPk5DWFiDjECowLX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, iQOO went with an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor this time around, and unlike the module on Samsung phones, it is actually usable and fast. It&apos;s using a Goodix sensor — like Vivo phones — and I didn&apos;t see any issues with authentication. Notably, it is positioned just right to access one-handed, unlike several devices I tested this year (looking at you, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>).</p>
<p>Another area where the iQOO 13 has a considerable advantage is ingress protection; the device has IP68/IP69 dust and water resistance as standard, and that&apos;s on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones.</a> On the whole, the iQOO 13 is one of the better-looking devices around, and while you don&apos;t get a brand-new design, the device is still stylish.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-display"><span>iQOO 13: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vMpCoYQWPueHMREmz8y8dh" name="iqoo-13-14.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMpCoYQWPueHMREmz8y8dh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the design itself hasn&apos;t changed, an area where the iQOO 13 has a considerable upgrade is the screen. You now get a bigger 6.82-inch AMOLED panel, and the refresh rate is increased to 144Hz, but that&apos;s in select use cases — most of the time, it&apos;s down to the standard 120Hz. The panel is noticeably brighter than last year — going up to 1800 nits in HBM mode — and while it doesn&apos;t quite match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> in this regard, there are zero issues using it under harsh sunlight.</p><p>What&apos;s great about this generation is that the bezels are even thinner, and that is easily noticeable when viewing the iQOO 13 next to its predecessor. The razor-thin bezels make gaming and streaming content that much more immersive, and on that note, I didn&apos;t see any issues with HDR content in Netflix or YouTube.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZiNEioYAMP4kgdhPhUPuFb" name="iqoo-13-17.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiNEioYAMP4kgdhPhUPuFb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s stereo sound as well, and it gets loud and detailed enough that I didn&apos;t see any issues in regular use. Color vibrancy is decent out of the box, although the hues on my unit tended to skew a little cooler. Thankfully, you get the ability to manually adjust color warmth, and switch to Bright or Professional modes. You even get the ability to dynamically adjust colors based on ambient light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FzuUGsBvTSJqQfnqVjmqGd" name="iqoo-13-18.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FzuUGsBvTSJqQfnqVjmqGd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel has QHD resolution this time (3168 x 1440), and the increased pixel density makes a difference in daily use — you get two additional lines of text while browsing. Another trait I like is the suite of eye protection features iQOO is rolling out with this generation; the iQOO 13 has 2592Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels, making it a great choice if you&apos;re sensitive to DC dimming. It also has something called anti-fatigue brightness adjustment, which basically tweaks brightness levels over time to reduce strain.</p>
<p>There&apos;s also a circular polarized tech, which claims to reduce dry eyes and fatigue by decreasing the glare coming from the panel. As is the case with all phones in this category, you get LTPO as standard, and the panel is able to go down to 1Hz when viewing images or in always-on mode. On that subject, you get always-on styles similar to most Vivo phones running Funtouch OS, but there are a few unique to iQOO.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-performance-and-battery"><span>iQOO 13: Performance and battery</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="phHFeaq2Y3ceuiDUWd9tyf" name="iqoo-13-22.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/phHFeaq2Y3ceuiDUWd9tyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, a big selling point of the iQOO 13 is that it comes with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. Although most phones powered by the silicon cost upwards of $1,000, the iQOO 13 has the distinction of being the most affordable of the lot, coming in at the equivalent of $630.</p><p>Without burying the lede too much, what I can tell you right now is that the iQOO 13 is a performance beast. It blazes through daily use cases without breaking a sweat, and it handles demanding games just as well. I didn&apos;t see any issues with overheating, and while the phone is on the conservative side with thermals, it doesn&apos;t throttle anywhere as early as its predecessor.</p>

<p>The iQOO 13 scored significantly higher than the Dimensity 9400-based Find X8 Pro in Geekbench 6&apos;s single and multi-core tests, and it was twice as fast in Geekbench AI. While it doesn&apos;t quite measure up in 3DMark tests, it managed a better stability score of 75.9% in the demanding Steel Nomad Light stress test, and didn&apos;t go beyond 42 degrees Celsius.  </p><p>While most games are still locked to 60fps, there are select titles that go up to 90fps and beyond. Interestingly, iQOO uses a custom Q2 chip to upscale games and boost framerates, and it does a great job in this regard. What I like the most is that it reduces jitter by maintaining a steady framerate, with the feature similar to what NVIDIA and AMD offer with G-Sync and FreeSync.</p><p>I&apos;m using the 16GB/512GB model of the iQOO 13, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues with the storage or memory. Multitasking is handled effortlessly, and the software is stable and optimized to take advantage of the silicon. You get the entire suite of AptX codecs, and there&apos;s Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and dual-band GPS.</p><p>The vibration motor has been overhauled, and it delivers much better feedback this time around. You can adjust the intensity of the feedback, and while the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X100 Ultra still have an edge in this area, there is a noticeable difference over the iQOO 12.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="voUL655c7KbKoYN8gRFzib" name="iqoo-13-23.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/voUL655c7KbKoYN8gRFzib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iQOO 13 comes with a huge 6,150mAh battery, although the Indian variant has a slightly smaller 6,000mAh battery. The increased battery size along with the efficiency gains of Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon means you get a huge uptick in battery life, and I got at least two days of use between charges. Even with heavy use, I didn&apos;t have to charge the iQOO 13 within the two-day window; it is one of the best devices I used in this regard.</p><p>The increase in battery size is attributed to the switch to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon anode</a>. Going this route allows brands to increase battery density, and that&apos;s why most Chinese-branded phones in 2025 have heady gains in this area. The limitation is that there&apos;s a single cell, but as the iQOO 13 uses Vivo&apos;s 120W charging tech, it takes just 34 minutes to fully charge the device.</p><p>It went up to the 50% mark in just 14 minutes, taking another 20 minutes to get the rest of the way. Honestly, if you need two-day battery life and the best charging tech currently available, the iQOO 13 is hard to beat.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="W3Kn6NEa8gFis86xcoCvMZ" name="iqoo-13-6.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W3Kn6NEa8gFis86xcoCvMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iQOO 13 gets a trio of 50MP cameras at the back, including a 50MP Sony IMX921 with 1/1.56-inch sensor and OIS, 50MP Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens with autofocus, and a 50MP Sony IMX816 telephoto with 2x optical zoom and OIS. If that sounds familiar, it&apos;s because the cameras are identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">Vivo V40 Pro</a> — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a>. The front camera is different, and it&apos;s using a 32MP module.</p><p>The camera interface itself is identical to last year; you get the shooting modes in a grid at the bottom, and you can easily switch between the various lenses. The phone has a Humanistic street mode that boosts the contrast and adds a heavy vignette to the shots, resulting in images that look very different to what you get from the regular modes.</p><p>When it comes to videos, all the lenses at the back can shoot 4K60, and that&apos;s good to see. There&apos;s decent stabilization, and while the resultant footage isn&apos;t quite on the same level as other flagships I used, it is better than the iQOO 12.</p>

<p>The iQOO 13 takes fantastic photos in daylight scenarios, producing shots with great dynamic range and color accuracy. Just like the V40 Pro, foliage doesn&apos;t have the best definition, but outside of that, I don&apos;t have any issues with the camera as such. The phone does just as well in low-light shots, and while you don&apos;t get quite the same color vibrancy as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>, Find X8 Pro, or other flagships, it delivers usable photos.</p><p>The wide-angle lens also does a great job in its own right, as does the 2x lens. Obviously, having a 3x zoom lens would be ideal, but you miss out on that, and while I got usable shots at up to 5x, it isn&apos;t the same as having a dedicated optical zoom lens with a greater zoom factor. The auxiliary lenses don&apos;t quite measure up at low-light, and this is where you see the biggest difference to the likes of the X100 Pro.</p><p>Ultimately, the iQOO 13 posts a strong showing, and while I put the phone one tier below other flagships, it does a much better job than its predecessor, and it is one of the best in this category. Yes, you&apos;ll get better photos out of the Vivo X100 Pro or the Find X8 Pro, but you&apos;ll also need to shell out much more cash.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sRjtSqHn9uRZrBAqit4Kxe" name="iqoo-13-20.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRjtSqHn9uRZrBAqit4Kxe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much to talk about on the software front. The iQOO 13 runs Vivo&apos;s Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and while it is technically new, the UI is visually unchanged to last year. You get the same notification pane, similar styling throughout, and the same customizability.</p><p>That said, the interface is fluid, and notably, it doesn&apos;t feel quite as iOS-esque as ColorOS 15, and that&apos;s an ironic turnaround considering the software&apos;s roots. Anyway, what you need to know is that the styling isn&apos;t cumbersome, and you get useful extras, including floating windows, a smart sidebar, and easy multitasking.</p><p>Interestingly, there&apos;s an RGB LED ring around the rear camera island dubbed Monster Halo, and it can be used for anything from notification and call alerts to battery notifications, and an atmospheric mode that cycles lighting effects. Look, I&apos;m all-in on RGB lighting, but I didn&apos;t use this feature as much as it involves putting the phone face-down on a table, and I don&apos;t do that. But I&apos;ll have to admit that it is very cool, and you can customize colors and effects by going into the settings — it&apos;s called Dynamic light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4cF52w2N5NHRNz46xF7RWg" name="iqoo-13-19.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4cF52w2N5NHRNz46xF7RWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only annoyance I ran into is that Funtouch is still a bit aggressive with memory management, so you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to disable optimization to get timely push notifications. Outside of that, I didn&apos;t see many problems. As is the case with every phone, you get a suite of AI-enabled features, and these mostly involve image editing — similar to Magic Eraser on the Pixels.</p><p>There&apos;s good news on the update side of things as well, with iQOO guaranteeing four Android OS updates alongside five years of security updates to the iQOO 13. That&apos;s one platform update more than what the iQOO 12 will pick up, and it&apos;s good to see iQOO matching Vivo in this regard. The phone picked up two software updates with stability tweaks and the latest security update, and it&apos;s good to see iQOO&apos;s phones getting the same level of attention as their Vivo siblings.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-the-competition"><span>iQOO 13: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mgad5mVFFLSKfnarJ3eJtd" name="iqoo-13-24.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgad5mVFFLSKfnarJ3eJtd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2025 launch cycle is about to heat up, and the iQOO 13 is going up against the OnePlus 13. That device also has a massive battery and 6.82-inch AMOLED panel, and it should take better photos. It comes down to what it costs in countries like India, but it is unlikely to deliver the same value as the iQOO 13.</p><p>Although the X100 Pro is considerably more costly, it has one of the best camera packages of the year. If that&apos;s a key consideration, I&apos;d recommend getting the X100 Pro instead; otherwise, the iQOO 13 is the better bargain by a long shot.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-13-should-you-buy-it"><span>iQOO 13: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GzSQV4NWeSHFAHFbqWeTKa" name="iqoo-13-2.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzSQV4NWeSHFAHFbqWeTKa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the latest Qualcomm hardware</li><li>You need the best battery life</li><li>You want a phone for gaming</li><li>You need a big AMOLED panel that's eye-friendly</li><li>You want good cameras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best telephoto lenses</li><li>You want the best low-light photos</li></ul>
<p>Ultimately, the iQOO 13 reinforces the fact that you don&apos;t need to spend north of $1,000 to get flagship-tier quality. The phone has the latest Qualcomm hardware, a high-quality AMOLED display with useful features, fluid software, and it will pick up long-term software updates.</p><p>The phone does a brilliant job at gaming, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why — iQOO is clearly targeting a younger audience with the device, and the unique additions allow you get stable framerates without worrying about overheating. On that note, the battery life is the best of any device I used this year, and you&apos;ll only need to charge the phone every two days on average.</p><p>There are decent upgrades with the cameras as well, and while the iQOO 13 doesn&apos;t quite measure up to the Find X8 Pro or Vivo X100 Ultra, it is much better than its predecessor in this regard, and that&apos;s an achievement in and of itself. Overall, if you need the best hardware but don&apos;t want to shell out quite as much cash, the iQOO 13 is the best choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>After a year with the amazing Onyx Boox Palma, I was looking forward to seeing a big Black Friday sale so I could recommend it as the go-to e-reader this holiday season. Unfortunately, Amazon only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CHF746JZ/"><strong>slashed the price by 12%</strong></a>, meaning it's not much cheaper than the Boox Palma 2 that just came out.</p><p>While I normally would recommend picking up a year-old device for a great discount, the Palma 2 is the better buy even though it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DGLJD69S/">currently $279</a>. How does this make any sense? Simply put, newer can be <em>notably</em> better in the world of cheap e-readers for a few hidden reasons, most of all is software support.</p><p>The Boox Palma 2 runs Android 13 while the original Palma is still on Android 11 and likely won't get updated to anything newer. Aside from some nice new features, that means the Palma 2 can run apps for at least two years longer than the original Palma because there's going to be a point where apps no longer support Android 11. Considering apps are THE reason to pick a Boox over other e-readers, this is enough for me to recommend the newer unit.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're looking to give your eyes a rest from your phone's harsh display, or you just want a more pocketable e-reader that's capable of running full Android apps.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You only read books through Amazon's Kindle service. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P"><strong>cheaper Kindles</strong></a> that are less than half the price of this.</p><p>I called the original Onyx Boox Palma "the perfect bedtime device" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">in my review</a>, and the second iteration improves the experience in a few small ways. Onyx didn't try to reinvent the wheel or radically alter the experience for the Palma 2, but it did include a faster processor, better speakers, and a fingerprint reader nestled in the power button.</p><p>The processor improvement makes everyday computing a little quicker and just generally improves the overall experience. Onyx also added a few extra new features to the device including an AI assistant that can answer questions, keeping your phone in your pocket (or in a cabinet) while you stay as distraction-free as possible.</p><p>The Palma 2 features the same amazing super fast refresh e-ink display as the original, which means it's perfect for scrolling through web pages, books, and plenty of other apps without having that classic e-reader refresh jank. Plus, it's super friendly on the eyes with no nasty PWM dimming or flickering backlight.</p><p>And while the Palma 2 is certainly capable of playing games, you're probably going to want to stick to crossword puzzles or Wordle-type games because it's tough to play most modern games on the black-and-white display. There's a reason the original GameBoy had simplistic games, so stick to those if you really want that from this device.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a new Chromebook, but prefer to have a premium tablet that doubles as a laptop.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook with more RAM and storage, or if you want to enjoy the variety of Chromebook Plus features.</p>
<p>This deal is for the base model, which includes 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-duet-gen-9-11-inch-mediatek/len101l0047">8GB/256GB version</a> isn't discounted, we suspect that might change at any time.</p><p>Ever since Lenovo released the original Chromebook Duet, the company has largely dominated the ChromeOS tablet space. While there have been a few competitors here and there, none of them have really been able to match up to the Duet line.</p><p>With this latest release, the MediaTek Kompanio 838 handles the heavy lifting, while still being efficient enough to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Chromebook Duet 11</a> last for up to 12 hours on a single charge. And while it might not carry the "Chromebook Plus" moniker, the Duet 11 still provides plenty of power to handle your daily workload.</p><p>The only major downside to this deal is that while you get the Folio Cover and keyboard, this specific bundle doesn't include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/stylus-pens-and-supplies/pens/4x81q72383">Lenovo USI Pen 2</a>. On the bright side, the Chromebook Duet 11 is compatible with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">best USI pens</a>, so even if you don't already have one, it's easy to get a stylus for your new Chromebook.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a fast, reliable smartwatch with great features and loads of battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d prefer a smartwatch from a bigger name like Samsung or Google; your daily routine relies heavily on Google Assistant.</p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ticwatch-smartwatches">best Ticwatch</a> that money can buy today, the biggest selling point of the Pro 5 is probably its incredible battery life. With Mobvoi&apos;s proprietary Essential Mode feature, you can personalize your watch&apos;s battery life to conserve energy for when you need it the most. Essential Mode drops the watch into ultra-low power settings that still give you access to the most crucial information, such as the time, date, heart rate tracking, and more. It&apos;s the kind of innovative feature that we hope to see on more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in the future. </p><p>Of course, like any device, the Ticwatch Pro 5 isn&apos;t perfect. There&apos;s no onboard Google Assistant support, for one, and the design may be a bit bulky if you have a smaller wrist. But still, if you&apos;re in the market for a new smartwatch this holiday season, 40% off the Ticwatch Pro 5 is a deal worth considering. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've been on the lookout for the thinnest and lightest Chromebook, or just want a bright and vibrant OLED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook that has a touchscreen or one with a convertible form-factor.</p>
<p>The biggest selling point for the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is that it's the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus model currently available. It measures 11.8mm thin, just a smidge thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (when folded.)</p><p>Once you lift the lid, you're presented with a beautiful 15.6-inch AMOLED display, complete with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. It's no slouch in the power department either, as its powered by the Intel Core 3 100U SoC, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>

<p>Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that this is the first Chromebook to be released with the brand-new Quick Insert key. This replaces the "Everything" key found on every other Chromebook and makes it easy to access various files or interact with Gemini without needing to switch apps or Chrome tabs.</p><p>If there's one thing that kind of bugs me about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, it's that there aren't any other configurations to choose from. This means that if you want more RAM or storage, you're just out of luck. Even still, it doesn't take away from the overall experience.</p>

The company makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">best smartphones</a>, which you've probably never used, and ships its products worldwide. We give Xiaomi pretty high marks when it comes to features, cameras, and performance.</p>

<p>The latest rumor says that the company is about to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-pursues-in-house-developed-phone-chip-report">start making its own chips</a>, which is a great idea. It would allow the company to make chips that do what it needs to do better than an off-the-shelf solution ever could. It's what we see from Apple and Google, and it works very well.</p><p>There's one more reason why Xiaomi can go its own way here: it doesn't rely on North American carriers to sell its phones so it doesn't have to build phones that use a chip and a network that were designed to <em>only</em> work best when paired with each other. The bulk of the company's sales are in Asia where things are a bit more general when it comes to network tech and customizations. Building its own chip is a win all around.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">an industry leader</a> when it comes to making chips for smart things, especially when those chips need to connect to the outside world. The company has worked hard to develop and manufacture products that are best-in-class when used with other equipment designed to work the same way.</p><p>Chances are you're in the U.S. or Canada because that's where the bulk of Android Central's web traffic comes from. Your phone almost certainly has a Qualcomm processor inside of it. There's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Qualcomm thought ahead when it came to designing a cellular modem. The company builds great products and holds patents that have changed the mobile landscape when it comes to phones, but it also works to make sure the chips powering other things — like equipment used by your phone carrier — are great. too.</p><p>If you build both sides of a network you have the chance to make it work better than anything else. In North America, Qualcomm did exactly that. Whether you use Rogers, AT&T, or T-Mobile, a Qualcomm-powered phone is going to perform better than one that uses another company's chip and relies on Qualcomm's networking patents to even work at all.</p>
<p>You need only look at Samsung. Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback" target="_blank">makes its own chips</a> and sells many products that use them, but the phones it sells in North America almost all use a Qualcomm processor.</p><p>That's not a bad thing for you and me. Qualcomm processors are great. They're powerful, battery-efficient, and work well with our phone company. However, it gives Qualcomm a lot of leverage over any company that relies on sales in North America. Like Samsung.</p><p>After licensing fees, logistics, and supply-chain wizardry it's probably cheaper for Samsung to use Qualcomm chips than to use its own. That means it might not spend the time and R&D money it should to make Exynos chips better because Qualcomm chips can do everything it needs them to do.</p>

<p>Qualcomm chips can not do everything Google wants them to do. A Snapdragon chip is better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g3-leaked-details-rumors">Google's Tensor chip</a> at a lot of things, but when it comes to AI acceleration Qualcomm is playing catch up. Google was working on AI while Qualcomm was working on everything else, so this makes sense.</p><p>Google decided to pay those licensing fees and work around other issues to sell phones that are great at AI because it thinks AI is that important. Pixel phones are lacking when it comes to performance, battery life, and connectivity at the expense of AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision" target="_blank">Google is fine with that</a>.</p>
<p>If Xiaomi decides to build its own chips, it can take a page out of that playbook with the advantage that it doesn't have to build phones to please Verizon; it can build phones that please its own executives and, hopefully, its customers, using custom chips. Cell providers in China or Indonesia are different than one in Ontario or Texas and there shouldn't be a downgrade when it comes to network performance for the majority of Xiaomi's customers.</p><p>Using Qualcomm chips (or MediaTek chips for that matter) is fine and Xiaomi phones are awesome because of them. Xiaomi has a chance to make them even better.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series was spotted rolling through the FCC for its required certification.</li><li>Per the files, the S25 Ultra is confirmed to feature 45W wired fast charging, an S Pen, Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, and more connectivity support.</li><li>The S25 Plus is confirmed to stick close to the Ultra; however, the base S25 model might see a sharp drop in wireless charging strength to 9W.</li><li>Samsung is expected to launch the next series in January 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next flagship series is reportedly grabbing U.S. certification and confirming several key points.</p><p>The Korean OEM's Galaxy S25 series was spotted in the FCC certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-fcc-certification/">91Mobiles</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-fcc-listing-3503726/">Android Authority</a>). Per the FCC's documents, the Galaxy S25 Ultra was confirmed as U.S. model number SM-938U. The device's files state it will continue to feature its S Pen. Additionally, the publication discovered the phone's charging capabilities.</p><p>According to the listing, the S25 Ultra's "travel adapter" features model number EP-T2510. More digging shows Samsung intends for the device to support 45W wired fast charging capabilities. We can breathe a sigh of relief as this means we won't see a change from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>Other specifications show the S25 Ultra will feature support for Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, 5G connectivity, GNSS, and NFC.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus with U.S. model number SM-936U will contain the same connectivity specifications as its Ultra sibling. Additionally, the listing confirms that it will also retain its 45W wired fast charging as its adapter's number matches the Ultra.</p><p>The base Galaxy S25 model (U.S. number SM-931U) snags the same connectivity specs, but its charging capabilities are where things differ from last year. The database states the phone will continue to support 25W wired fast charging, but its wireless function takes a hit. The S25 will reportedly support up to 9W wireless charging, down from the S24's 15W strength.</p>

<p>There are other specifications that haven't been confirmed, mostly those regarding its internal and physical aspects. However, the series is expected to rock Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Another expected aspect is for the Galaxy S25 series to take on a flatter design. The Galaxy S25 Ultra was tipped to ditch those sharp corners for softer, rounded corners to help with its handheld use. We've since seen a short <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaks-on-video">hands-on video</a> about the device leak, giving us a slight glimpse at its new form and flat sides. Joining that is a series of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/additional-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-7-images-leak">alleged live images</a> of the phone, which showcased its flatter design, thin bezels, and a bit of One UI 7.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">a South Korean report</a> claims Samsung's executive might bet big on the Galaxy S25 series topping its 2024 trio. The company was reportedly preparing to begin production of the new series to have roughly 2 million phones ready by December. Another 5 million are supposedly primed to come off the line in January. Samsung is also interested in funneling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">even more AI</a> into its next-gen devices.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut the Galaxy S25 series in January.</p>

There are still a lot of vehicles without that luxury, which is why there's been a steady stream of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories" target="_blank">adapters and dongles</a> to bridge the gap.</p><p>Carlinkit is one such brand that's been doing it for a while. Hence, the Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) is a successor to previous models, each one designed to be simpler and smoother than the last.</p><p>Plugging this in the first time means you should be up and running every time you turn on the ignition thereafter. Is that how it turns out? It only takes a few trips to find out.</p>

<h2 id="cutting-the-cord-2">Cutting the cord</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9b4gzxH9SFA2fFJdjgLRuL" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-unbox" alt="Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) unboxed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9b4gzxH9SFA2fFJdjgLRuL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Carlinkit 5.0's simplicity is obvious once you unbox it. It's just the adapter itself with two cables, one USB-C-to-USB-C and one USB-C-to-USB-A, ensuring you can connect to your car regardless of which USB port it has. You could be a little confused since the adapter also has both USB-C and USB-A ports, except the latter is meant for updating the device. More on that later.</p><p>Once you first bring it into your vehicle, you only need to plug it in after turning on the ignition. Built-in LEDs behind the Carlinkit logo on the unit indicate status, with pink showing up and flashing blue indicating the adapter has power. It then turns solid pink during the setup phase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UMo9aZ99aovLyG4bnEcYB" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-setup" alt="Holding Carlinkit 5.0 adapter with logo flashing pink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMo9aZ99aovLyG4bnEcYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The included manual has instructions for setting up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Apple CarPlay, though both generally follow the same type of sequence. The Carlinkit unit should appear in your phone's Bluetooth menu (as "AutoKit" or something similar). Select it to start the pairing process and it will work in the background to establish the connection.</p><p>It flashes blue as it works to do so but you'll only know that pairing was successful when you see Android Auto pop up on your infotainment screen. If you've set up Android Auto from your phone before — even if you used another dongle/adapter like this — you shouldn't have to go through the introductory setup. It literally picks up where you left off the last time you connected.</p><p>Subsequent connections usually see the platform appear on your vehicle screen in about 10 seconds, though I've found that isn't a hard and fast rule with this device. There were times when it took mere seconds to do it, and others where it seemed to struggle a few times before finally making it happen.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="agoZPZRX6uLnvsjvyYKCtW" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-Android-Auto-screen" alt="Android Auto home screen after connecting with Carlinkit 5.0 adapter." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/agoZPZRX6uLnvsjvyYKCtW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More often than not, Carlinkit 5.0 does its singular job well. You get in the car, start it up, and eventually carry on with whatever content you were listening to before you got in. If you've never experienced wireless Android Auto for yourself, the liberating feeling is immensely satisfying, even more so because you don't lose the platform's integration while also letting you wirelessly charge your phone if you're using a dock supporting the feature.</p><p>Whether streaming music, making phone calls, getting a route in Waze, or talking to Google Assistant, this adapter doesn't make any of those features feel difficult. Once it connects, it stays connected. On top of that, it remains steady in that it's not all that buggy, either.</p><p>The problem is when it doesn't necessarily connect properly, it becomes obvious. There may be false starts or intermittent cutouts, the latter of which I attribute to bad reception because it's happened to numerous wireless Android Auto dongles I've tested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FkKnEgxJNgf3jhHA8shbEe" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-connected" alt="Holding Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) in hand with successful connection." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FkKnEgxJNgf3jhHA8shbEe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also some other caveats along the way that can prove challenging. If you share the vehicle with a spouse or partner, they may run into trouble trying to connect to the device, and Carlinkit's poor documentation and instructions don't really add a lot of confidence. That can happen whether they're using Android Auto or CarPlay.</p><p>Carlinkit 5.0 doesn't offer a seamless way to switch users the way certain others do, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/carsifi-review" target="_blank">Carsifi</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories" target="_blank">AAWireless</a>, for instance. It's not that you can't, but to do it, the one who first connects has to disconnect the Bluetooth connection and let the other connect in order to make it work. It's clunky and not exactly ideal.</p><p>You also have the benefit of firmware updates to keep the adapter current, albeit without a clearer path to install them. I'm nitpicking here, but I'm doing so because I can see where users who aren't as savvy with these types of devices might feel lost. There is no Carlinkit app on the Play Store, forcing you to run through a process of connecting to the device's Wi-Fi signal and typing in an IP address (noted in the manual) in your phone browser to find and install the update. It's worth doing because updates do come out, but it won't feel smooth.</p>
<h2 id="simply-getting-the-job-done-2">Simply getting the job done</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aXjeDQVaBnMwEpbRt7LaxF" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-Android-Auto-next" alt="Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) adapter next to Android Auto on infotainment screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXjeDQVaBnMwEpbRt7LaxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) has a regular price of $90 but you'll often find it selling for less online. At its discounted price, it's hard to argue with the role it plays, particularly if your needs and expectations are fairly basic. When you just want to cut the cord and go wireless running Android Auto, this gizmo can cover that well.</p><p>The rest of the experience is partly hindered by the confusing manual. Carlinkit would establish some trust with consumers if it suggested updating the firmware as one of the <em>first moves</em> to make upon setting it up. An app would then make the update process far smoother than it currently is. Put those things in place, and there's very little to find fault with on this thing.</p>
