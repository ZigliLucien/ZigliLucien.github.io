<ul><li>A new female voice for Gemini is apparently being tested, providing users with two voice options now.</li><li>The new voice feature is currently only available for Android users, not iOS or web.</li><li>The new voice options are in a limited trial phase and are not yet globally available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been tweaking its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> language model, and the next update might be a brand-new voice interface.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> currently offers a variety of voice options, but Google&apos;s new AI assistant, Gemini, which might replace Assistant, has only had one voice so far. However, a recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/gemini-new-voice/#more-631041" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> suggests this is about to change as Google is working on adding more voice options for Gemini.</p><p>At this year&apos;s Google I/O conference, the company announced plans to roll out a wider selection of realistic voice options for users to choose from.</p><p>Then, about a month ago, early signs indicated that Google was working on a new voice setup for Gemini, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-new-voices-3452126/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Back then, the feature was still in its early stages, meaning it wasn&apos;t operational at the time.</p><p>9to5&apos;s report reveals that Google is experimenting with a new female voice for its Gemini AI. Now, users can choose between two different voices. The new voice sounds much more natural compared to the previous, more mechanical-sounding option.</p><p>Unfortunately, this improved voice experience is only available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> right now, with iOS and web users unable to access the new voice yet. Plus, there&apos;s no option to switch back to the original voice.</p><p>Furthermore, it looks like this voice enhancement is in a limited trial phase and isn&apos;t available to users worldwide yet.</p><p>Having multiple voice options might not be groundbreaking, but it definitely improves the user experience. These kinds of improvements can boost user adoption since voice personalization is a common expectation for digital assistants nowadays.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest move seems like a direct response to OpenAI&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more-tools-to-chatgpt-free/" target="_blank">recent new voice features for GPT-4o</a>. The fierce competition in the generative AI field has sped up development timelines, and Google&apos;s quick release of extra voice options for Gemini shows just how fierce the race is.</p>

As just one example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon is offering 40% off the Google Pixel 7a</strong></a><strong>  </strong>right now, representing $200 off the phone&apos;s normal list price. Released last year, the Pixel 7a offers an excellent camera, a pretty design, and a good-looking 90Hz AMOLED screen. It comes with 128GB of storage, and the powerful Google Tensor G2 processor that makes performance smooth and fun to use.</p><p>All in all, this economy-priced phone looks even more appealing at almost half off, especially for those who like the Pixel ecosystem.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> is 40% off at Amazon right now, making it an even cheaper price than this affordable phone usually is. From its high-quality camera and 6.1-inch display to its beautiful design and haptics, the 7a offers a great Pixel experience—and $200 off doesn't hurt, either.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Pixel-7a-5G-128GB-8GB-6-1-Fully-Unlocked-GSM-Verizon-Excellent-Used/2535247999" target="_blank">Walmart - $302.99</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-7a-5g-128gb-unlocked-charcoal/6539915.p?skuId=6539915" target="_blank">Best Buy - $299.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="09820b71-3b48-40e5-9aa8-80adfb1f6eaa" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 7a: $499.00" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 7a: $499.00">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> having a phone with a high-quality camera is a selling point for you; you want something that offers many years of software updates; you&apos;re already a fan of or own other Pixel products.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d prefer to spend a little more on extra battery life; you need a phone with more than 5W charging; you&apos;d prefer the newer Pixel 8a. </p><p>Despite being a last-gen device, the Pixel 7a remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> available today. We like it for its high-quality photo- and video-taking capabilities and features, as well as its aesthetically pleasing 6.1-inch AMOLED screen. The Pixel 7a also comes with five years of Pixel updates, super smooth performance due to the Tensor G2 chipset, which is also shared by the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. Beyond that, users like that it offers IP67 water and dust resistance, and the 7a generally performs better than its more affordable smartphone peers.</p><p>To be sure, the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> is the better midrange Pixel phone, but if you&apos;re looking at a budget of around 300 bucks, you&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find a deal better than this. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung spent a while teasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, after previewing it at the first Unpacked of the year and showing it off in more detail at Mobile World Congress. However, it was far from certain that the smart ring would be a success. There were rumors about an expensive pricing model that could&apos;ve featured a high upfront cost <em>and</em> a subscription. Plus, Samsung was going against brands like Oura and others which have a lot more experience in the space.</p><p>It seems like even Samsung might&apos;ve doubted how much of a hit the Galaxy Ring would be. The smart ring sold out just a few days after pre-orders opened up, and far before the ring&apos;s official release date. Third-party retailers kept accepting Galaxy Ring preorders but made no official estimation of when they might ship. </p><p>As of late last week, the Galaxy Ring became available again, albeit with long shipping windows. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/18/samsung-galaxy-ring-restock-delayed-shipping/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first discovered the restock and noted that some sizes are still hard to get, even after Samsung started accepting preorders for the Galaxy Ring again. In fact, some combinations of sizes and colors are still sold out completely. </p><p>The official release date for the Galaxy Ring is July 24, but buyers who place a preorder now will have to wait significantly longer than that. Some uncommon sizes and colorways are available sooner than the more popular ones. You can get a Galaxy Ring in size six and the titanium silver color for delivery on July 26, just a few days after the release date. However, sizes 10 and 12 come with Aug. 7 delivery dates, and you won&apos;t get a size 11 ring until Aug. 21.</p><p>If you need a size 13 ring, you&apos;re completely out of luck. Delivery is "unavailable" for a Galaxy Ring in that size — for any colorway — and you&apos;re not able to place a preorder at all. </p>

<p>We don&apos;t know how many smart rings Samsung made in its initial production run, so it&apos;s hard to call the Galaxy Ring a resounding success this early. It is clear that demand has exceeded supply, and that does tell us one of two things. Either the company played it safe, testing the waters before placing high-volume production orders. Or, it underestimated the demand for the Galaxy Ring entirely, and was surprised by the overwhelming amount of preorders. </p><p>Regardless of which possible scenario is actually true, it&apos;s still impressive that the Galaxy Ring sold out so early. You have to consider that the initial wave of preorders came before most initial reviews of the Galaxy Ring were live. That means early buyers were mostly going off of Samsung&apos;s claims and the media&apos;s first impressions, and enough people bought in based on that alone. </p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-galaxy-ring-so-popular-2">Why is the Galaxy Ring so popular?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-hands-on-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I ended up placing a preorder for the Galaxy Ring, though I bought mine <em>after</em> it sold out, so I don&apos;t have a delivery date at all currently. As an early buyer, I think there are two main reasons why the Galaxy Ring has been so popular already despite not even being officially released yet. The first one is that smart rings are the real deal. It&apos;s easy to say they&apos;re a gimmick because they have basic sensors and no on-device interface. But that&apos;s far from the case. </p><p>The benefit of a smart ring is that you can wear it all the time. With a smartwatch, you have to keep it charged, and it&apos;s bulky. I can&apos;t wear a smartwatch to bed — it&apos;s just too clunky and uncomfortable — and I lose out on sleep-tracking insights as a result. Even a slim tracker like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0</a> is too disruptive. That&apos;s where a smart ring comes in. You can wear it in the shower, during your day-to-day life, and to bed. With long battery life and quick charging, you can wear a smart ring almost every hour of every day. </p><p>Now, the second reason the Galaxy Ring is a hit is because it&apos;s the first smart ring to deeply integrate with a smartphone ecosystem. It&apos;s true that devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">Oura Ring</a> work on both iOS and Android, but they don&apos;t have deeper integration, and people want that deep integration. There&apos;s a reason Apple users buy an Apple Watch, Pixel users buy a Pixel Watch, and Galaxy users buy a Galaxy Watch. It just creates a better experience. </p><p>Samsung is quietly building a compelling health ecosystem with the Galaxy Ring and the Galaxy Watch at the forefront. It&apos;s appealing to me, and apparently, it&apos;s appealing to many others. We shouldn&apos;t discount how impressive it is that the Galaxy Ring sold out in the preorder stage, and we definitely shouldn&apos;t discredit smart rings in general.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the anticipation building for Google&apos;s latest hardware, the tech giant is already teasing a special offer for early Pixel 9 Pro pre-orders.</p><p>If you&apos;re in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, or Singapore, you can get a free “limited-edition collectible” with your Pixel 9 Pro pre-order. This news comes straight from some teasers at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/tw/magazine/google_pixel_9_pro?hl=zh-TW&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Store</a> in Taiwan, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/pixel-9-pro-pre-order-gift/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The report reveals that this special item will come in a square box decorated with the iconic Google "G" logo and Google Store branding. Considering Google&apos;s trend toward compact packaging for its Pixel devices, there&apos;s speculation that this outer box might contain the regular Pixel retail package, with the collectible tucked inside, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-pro-pre-order-mystery-collectible-box/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>.</p><p>Google is fueling the excitement about the box&apos;s contents by hinting that it’s tied to Pixel&apos;s design legacy.</p><p><em>"Own a piece of Google Pixel design history, exclusively for the first orders of our new Pixel 9 Pro phones. Limited time while supply lasts—be quick."</em></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1509px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.15%;"><img id="bJosWpHdm74YpvV9ndMeG4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-collectible.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro collectible teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJosWpHdm74YpvV9ndMeG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1509" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Store (Taiwan))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though Google hints that the collectible is a piece of Pixel design history, the exact item is still a mystery. Sadly, its vague description also rules out the possibility of it being a Pixel Watch or Buds.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>&apos;s pre-order campaign last year offered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> as a complimentary incentive to early adopters.</p><p>Nevertheless, consumers usually see a bunch of limited-time incentives on launch day. These often feature discounts and Google Store credit for accessories.</p><p>The teaser popped up a few days after Google showed off some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">previews of the Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold in its latest promo videos</a>.</p><p>Sadly, this special pre-order bonus is only available in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, leaving Pixel fans in other regions disappointed.</p><p>Choosing those Asia-Pacific countries for the exclusive pre-order incentive is an interesting move by Google. This targeted approach seems to be a deliberate effort to boost sales and market presence for the premium Pixel 9 Pro in these regions.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Marketing for the new OnePlus Watch 2R styles it as a sporty, long-lasting Wear OS watch for "inspiring an active lifestyle," with a lighter design for "those who value all-day fitness" tracking. I love watches that cater directly to me, but my colleagues who tested the OnePlus Watch 2 bashed its health data as its Achilles&apos; heel. So I decided to test the Watch 2R accuracy for myself.</p><p>With the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, our reviewer Harish complained that it "just isn&apos;t reliable at daily step counts or activity tracking," that it misjudged burned calories after workouts, and that its stress data was artificially elevated. </p><p>Meanwhile, my colleague Nick did a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">one-week OnePlus Watch 2 test</a> and had similar complaints about underestimated steps and significantly lower HR numbers during anaerobic workouts. Both Nick and Harish suspected that the watch used its low-power RTOS coprocessor to handle health and fitness sampling and that it wasn&apos;t fast or consistent enough to get proper readings.</p><p>This made me leery about testing the OnePlus Watch 2R, a fitness watch that theoretically couldn&apos;t handle fitness all that well. So, just like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> last week, I strapped on two smartwatches to see how the Watch 2R could match up against my Garmin Forerunner 965 for heart rate and dual-band GPS accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="my-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test-2">My OnePlus Watch 2R fitness test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-versus-Garmin-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2R (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus&apos; OHealth companion app doesn&apos;t let you export TCX/GPX files like Samsung Health, and I had some issues getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> to send my data properly, so I couldn&apos;t do my usual HR or GPS charts for a direct comparison; I&apos;ll use tables as an alternative for now.</p>

<p>For my first jog, the OnePlus Watch 2R stayed mostly on track with the Garmin Forerunner 965. I spot-checked heart rates at ten different timestamps, and the 2R matched the 965 four times and was 1bpm short six times, which dovetails with the 1bpm-lower average.</p><p>GPS accuracy mostly remained on point. It&apos;s difficult to say if OnePlus&apos; dual-band accuracy is more or less reliable than Garmin&apos;s since both maps had me straying off the sidewalk at odd moments, but I appreciated that both fell into the same general ballpark for a run with some signal-blocking foliage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-running-form-stats.jpeg" alt="Running form data on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for running dynamics, the OnePlus Watch 2R synced pretty well for stride length and average vertical ratio, but measured my vertical oscillation as 1cm shorter and average ground contact time as 18ms longer.</p>

<p>I ran eight 400m laps for my second track run, and Garmin predictably stayed on point because it uses saved track maps to judge your likely location. OnePlus had more issues: the Watch 2R buzzed my wrist with lap or mile times at about the 350m mark, consistently. It was as if the starting point was completely wrong, but then the GPS was pinpoint-accurate when I hit that incorrect spot. Still, it threw my calculated pace off by a decent margin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-and-Garmin-Forerunner-965.jpeg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2R (left) and Garmin Forerunner 965 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I figured the heart rate for a hard-paced track workout would be the sticking point, but its HR average was more accurate than the Galaxy Watch Ultra during my track workout last week. It certainly fell short of Garmin&apos;s results — typically 1–3 bpm short at a given moment — but typically leveled out to the correct number given enough time. Certainly, the Watch 2R did much better than the Watch 2 in this area.</p><p>Again, OnePlus&apos; running dynamics data diverged from Garmin in small ways. I don&apos;t quite get how OnePlus said I took more steps per minute while leaving my feet on the ground for longer. However, I realized after my run that OHealth had my height listed as 5&apos;7 (I&apos;m 6&apos;1), so maybe that skewed the results for things like vertical oscillation. Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form data isn&apos;t worth obsessing over</a>, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="overall-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-impressions-2">Overall OnePlus Watch 2R fitness impressions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-heart-rate-summary.jpeg" alt="Post-run heart rate average and max on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This might simply be a case of low expectations skewing my impressions, but the OnePlus Watch 2R feels like a strong budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>. It has a comfortable weight for its display size, three-day battery life with Wear OS 4, Google Assistant, and a $229 price tag that I&apos;d expect from an Amazfit watch — not something with proper app support.</p><p>OHealth provides some in-depth and surprisingly accessible data for running, offering detailed context for certain stats like training effect, running dynamics, VO2 Max, and recovery time — though Garmin wants me to rest an extra day and has my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> slightly lower. </p><p>That said, it&apos;s still quite basic compared to other tie-in fitness apps. OHealth provides a lot of individual run data, but its long-term training load and workout summary data is on the simplistic side. If I used the Watch 2R long-term, I&apos;d most likely auto-sync the data to Strava and rely on that instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR" name="oneplus-watch-2-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OnePlus Watch 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Circling back to my colleagues&apos; complaints about the original OnePlus Watch 2, my final step count across both runs was 11,670 for the Forerunner 965 and 11,560 for the Watch 2R. </p><p>Garmin watches beat every other brand in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">first</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">second step-counting tests</a>, so I&apos;ll treat the first number as an accurate control group. About 100 steps off across 11,000 steps is almost a rounding error, and significantly better than the OnePlus Watch 2 vs. the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> across the same distance (1,860 short). The same goes for my recent Galaxy Watch Ultra test against the Forerunner 965 after 10,000 steps (348 steps short).</p><p>OnePlus did underreport my burned calories compared to Garmin, but to be honest, I&apos;ve <strong>never</strong> seen any two watch brands agree on how many calories you&apos;ve burned. I don&apos;t know what goes into that algorithm and how to tell which ones flatter or sell you short. So I&apos;m not too fussed about it looking like OnePlus is on the low end, since it&apos;s just an estimate.</p><p>Really, my biggest complaint with the OnePlus Watch 2R is the same one I have with the Galaxy Watch Ultra: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">lack of a crown</a>. OnePlus gave the Watch 2 an inactive crown that spins and does nothing, while the Watch 2 has two simple buttons, one of which pulls up workouts by default unless you change the shortcut. I do appreciate that, but the sweaty-stained displays in the pics above should show why I don&apos;t like relying on swipes during workouts. Give me up/down buttons or a crown any day.</p><p>I need more time for a full OnePlus Watch 2R review that dives deeper into the health and sleep side of things. But I&apos;m much more bullish about its chances of being worthwhile for casual athletes than I was a week ago -- and matching up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a> for quality.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R has a Snapdragon W5 CPU, 500mAh battery, 1.43-inch display, dual-band GPS, NFC tap-to-pay, Google Assistant, and detailed post-run metrics. It's not as stylish or rugged as the original Watch 2, but it's much lighter, more affordable, and seemingly lacks the same HR issues.</p></p>

The Chinese company has been dipping its toes in the budget phone segment for the last several years, and now it has refreshed its Camon line with a new model.</p><p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G might not be the first device you think of when shopping for an affordable Android phone, but it&apos;s stepping into the ring regardless. Does it have the chops to challenge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">leading budget Android phones</a>? We&apos;re about to find out.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-price-and-availability"><span>TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-02-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G retails for roughly $350, although price varies by market. The company says it is available to purchase across more than 70 countries, except the Western markets such as the United States. TECNO&apos;s markets include Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-camon-30-premier-5g-what-i-like"><span>TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WQgdgSnNbVbmDxD2ws7hNa" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-13-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQgdgSnNbVbmDxD2ws7hNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s most compelling attribute arguably lies within its camera system. This really shows TECNO&apos;s determination to earn the title of "flagship killer."</p><p>The phone is packed with a powerful quad-camera system, led by a 50MP Sony IMX890 main sensor. Supporting it are three additional 50MP cameras: a wide-angle lens for stunning landscapes, a macro lens for detailed close-ups, and a portrait lens. For selfies, there&apos;s a 50MP front camera with autofocus and eye-tracking capabilities.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s innovative PolarAce technology powers this impressive setup, featuring the Sony CXD5622G imaging chip. This chip is the first to offer "end-side FP16 floating-point computing with the power of 4.6TFLOPS@FP16."</p><p>The technical specs might sound complex, so let&apos;s break down what they mean for you. This phone promises sharper videos even in low light, thanks to AI noise reduction and HDR for balanced lighting. However, it&apos;s not all roses (more on that later). Regardless, the 4K portrait video feature allowed me to take high-resolution close-ups with a blurred background.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-02-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G rear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uj7GjTPXT9JMLpanTrdpGe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO might be throwing around a lot of technical terms for its camera system, but the key takeaway is this: it uses a powerful dual-chip setup, featuring a Sony imaging chip, to deliver noticeably improved photos.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera tries to balance natural colors with vibrant ones. Most photos, especially landscapes, look great, but I noticed that the AI sometimes oversaturates scenes with lots of blue sky and green grass, making them look a bit unrealistic.</p><p>still, the handset&apos;s camera versatility shines here. Even without portrait mode, the main sensor achieves a beautiful depth of field. Furthermore, the 3x optical zoom delivers detailed close-ups, and HDR technology ensures balanced exposure in various lighting conditions. This phone&apos;s camera is a clear contender in its class.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The telephoto lens is exceptional with a dedicated 50MP sensor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One area where the Camon 30 Premier 5G punches above its weight is the telephoto lens. Unlike many budget phones, it boasts a dedicated 50MP sensor with 3x optical zoom, capturing crisp close-up shots without sacrificing detail. The ultra-wide camera, while not the absolute widest available, delivers impressive detail and good color fidelity that complements the main sensor.</p><p>The front-facing camera doesn&apos;t disappoint either. Autofocus, a feature typically found in premium phones, ensures sharp and detailed selfies. Additionally, the camera captures natural-looking skin tones.</p>

<p>While the Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera system delivers good results overall, there&apos;s room for improvement. A slightly lighter touch with image processing, particularly regarding AI saturation in certain scenarios, could elevate photo quality to even greater heights.</p><p>The phone&apos;s display is a also feast for the eyes. Sharp resolution and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate combine to create an immersive viewing experience that is perfect for devouring your favorite content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oKjAkkzwUpTEPj6LTtE7uf" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-11-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKjAkkzwUpTEPj6LTtE7uf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display boasts a fairly impressive 1400 nits of peak brightness, ideal for conquering glare in bright outdoor environments. However, enabling auto-brightness is necessary to access this level, and its reliability wasn&apos;t always perfect in my testing.</p><p>Thankfully, everyday tasks like social media scrolling, app launching, and web browsing felt smooth, with only occasional hiccups. Even demanding games like Genshin Impact ran decently at medium graphics with 60fps, though I experienced minor stutters in rare instances.</p><p>Endurance isn&apos;t a concern with the Camon 30 Premier 5G. Packing a generous 5,000mAh battery, it delivered more than eight hours of screen-on time during light use. This translates to ample power for all-day tasks.</p>

<p>The device ups the ante with a speedy 70W charger included in the box. In my tests, it fueled the phone from empty to more than 50% in just 15 minutes, with a full charge taking around 40 minutes. That&apos;s impressive for a phone in this price range.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s design hints at a company pushing boundaries. Unboxing it reveals a phone that aspires to a more premium aesthetic. While its flat-edged metallic frame follows current trends, the phone really shines with its unique "Tech-Art Leather" back. This material, featuring a snowy motif, integrates with the matte plastic texture and silver frame, creating a captivating interplay of textures and visual intrigue.</p><p>Its camera module also reminds me of classic cameras. It features a fixed zoom ring around the lenses, adding a nostalgic touch and helping with heat dissipation, according to TECNO. That said, it does not have any practical function at all.</p><p>Enhancing the premium feel, the Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts TECNO&apos;s strongest aluminum frame yet, housed in a remarkably high-quality case included in the box.</p><p>Despite weighing 210g, the Camon 30 Premier 5G feels surprisingly comfortable in hand. This is likely due to its well-thought-out design that ensures balanced weight distribution.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="aKJjP2goqSBTQfMdaFa9A8" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-10-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKJjP2goqSBTQfMdaFa9A8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts impressive specs for photo capture, video recording is an area for improvement. Despite offering 4K resolution at 30fps or 60fps, stabilization falls short, particularly in low-light conditions. Footage can appear shaky, and even daytime recordings lack the smoothness I expected, even with a gimbal.</p><p>However, the biggest downside of the phone is its software. TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 skin, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and the overall software strategy have several shortcomings that I can&apos;t overlook.</p><p>Although it&apos;s smooth and functional, the software is somewhat unattractive and cluttered with unnecessary apps, many of which can&apos;t be uninstalled. It&apos;s not just the number of apps but also the fact that most users won&apos;t recognize names like AHA Games, Ella, and Hi Theme.</p><p>Simply put, the old problem of bloatware is still present. You&apos;ll find the usual duplicate web browser, a custom voice assistant awkwardly running alongside Google&apos;s, and a separate app store.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 introduces a mandatory TECNO account sign-up process, which some users might find inconvenient. Additionally, swiping left no longer brings up the familiar Google Discover feed; instead, it displays TECNO&apos;s own selection of widgets. These widgets, which include recently used apps and phone usage stats, might not appeal to everyone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Software is functional but unattractive and cluttered with non-removable bloatware.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The company&apos;s update policy for the Camon 30 Premier 5G is also a concern. The phone is only promised two major OS upgrades, lagging behind competitors like Xiaomi, which offers three, and OnePlus, which offers four. Additionally, TECNO hasn&apos;t specified how often these updates will be released.</p><p>While the software experience has room for improvement, TECNO does introduce some interesting features. For instance, the built-in dialer app integrates a WhatsApp icon, allowing you to initiate direct messages without saving contacts beforehand.</p><p>TECNO pre-installs its Ella GPT AI assistant, too, offering an alternative to Google Assistant. While Ella GPT can handle basic tasks, it may not be suitable for complex instructions or extended conversations. Users seeking a more robust AI experience might prefer established options like Gemini or ChatGPT.</p><p>Another feature that caught my eye was the AI-powered wallpaper generator, similar to the one in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-note-40-pro-plus-review">Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus 5G</a> (this makes sense, given that both brands are owned by the same parent company). While many smartphone manufacturers are adding generative AI features, TECNO&apos;s approach is pretty unique, and I hope it becomes more popular.</p>

<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G is a solid choice in its price range. It packs features and performance that can go head-to-head with established models like the Samsung Galaxy A55 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a>, making it a great value for those watching their budget.</p><p>While boasting a slightly higher price point than the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G, the Samsung Galaxy A55 positions itself as a reliable option. It excels in battery life and display quality, effortlessly handling everyday tasks. However, its camera system might not be the absolute strongest in this price range, and the absence of wireless charging may be a drawback for some users. In the end, the Galaxy A55 focuses on practicality rather than flashy features, appealing to those who want a dependable, no-frills phone.</p><p>Xiaomi steps up its mid-range game with the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus. The phone exudes a more premium aesthetic with its improved design and exceptional display.  This iteration welcomes back the crowd-pleasing features of rapid charging and a powerful main camera but retains the brand&apos;s well-documented software shortcomings. Despite this, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus cements Xiaomi&apos;s position in the sub-$400 market, offering a solid option for budget-conscious consumers looking for a well-rounded device.</p>

The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G disrupts this norm by delivering a remarkably capable device brimming with innovative features, all at an exceptionally accessible price point. This phone changes the game, allowing budget-conscious consumers to enjoy flagship-level technology without the hefty cost.</p><p>However, the Camon 30 Premier 5G has a few drawbacks, like aggressive color processing from the AI and some limitations in low-light photography.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The 41mm base Pixel Watch 3 model with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is rumored to start at €399.</li><li>Meanwhile, the LTE version of the 41mm model might be priced at €499, which is €100 more than the Pixel Watch 2 LTE.</li><li>The rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL could start at €449 for the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth model and €549 for the LTE version, marking the first time Google offers two sizes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak from a French site reveals the prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> and Pixel Watch 3 XL, and it&apos;s not looking good.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/google-pixel-watch-3-et-3-xl-voici-les-prix-europeens-et-toutes-les-configurations-des-montres-connectees-a-venir-en-aout-55581" target="_blank">Dealabs</a> claims that the base model (41mm) with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is expected to start at €399, matching the launch price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> in other markets (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-watch-3-xl-pricing-leaked-not-going-like/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>The leak also hints at a price hike for the LTE version of the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, which is expected to be priced at €499. This is a bump up from the Pixel Watch 2 LTE&apos;s launch price of €399. So, we&apos;re looking at an increase of €50 to €100, which might not sit well with budget-conscious buyers.</p><p>These prices might seem pretty high on their own, and even more so when you compare them to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">leading Android smartwatches</a> on the market. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 starts at just €319 for the Wi-Fi model and €369 for the LTE version.</p><p>The rumored Pixel Watch 3 XL isn&apos;t helping the price concerns, either. According to Dealabs, the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth model might start at €449, while the LTE version could be €549. This would be a first for Google, offering the Pixel Watch in two different sizes, if the rumors are accurate.</p><p>Interestingly, Dealabs points out that the official name for the larger model is still uncertain. While most leaks call it the Pixel Watch 3 XL, there&apos;s no official confirmation yet.</p><p>Dealabs also gives us a glimpse at the potential strap colors. The 41mm model might come in Hazel, Obsidian, Pink, and Porcelain. Meanwhile, the 45mm model could have fewer options, with just Hazel, Obsidian, and Porcelain.</p><p>Even though these European prices might not match up exactly in the US, it&apos;s likely that we&apos;ll see a similar price increase for the Pixel Watch 3 when it launches in the country.</p><p>Whether the price hike is worth it depends on what the Pixel Watch 3 offers. Besides the new XL model, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">probably won&apos;t see major design changes</a>. There&apos;s supposed to be a new chipset and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-fcc-listing-detailed">ultra-wideband upgrade for Watch Unlock</a>, but it&apos;s unclear how much these will improve things.</p><p>The exact release date for the Pixel Watch 3 is still up in the air, according to this source. While the Pixel 9 Pro is expected to be unveiled at the Made by Google event on August 13, the smartwatch might be released later in the year, separate from the phone launch.</p>

First, Google posted a quick teaser on X, giving us a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> in a champagne gold-like color.

The device comes loaded with the  AI Toolbox, which helps users accelerate their workflows. The device comes with a large 9,510mAh battery and a flash charging tech that recharges the device within 81 minutes.  The sleek 6.49mm and 584g pad features a Nimbus Gray all-metal body. It comes with add-on accessories like the OnePlus Stylo 2 and the OnePlus Pad 2 Smart Keyboard.</p><p>Now coming to the Watch 2R— it features an "ergonomic" design with two physical buttons on the side of its face, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>. One button will quickly navigate to the user&apos;s stored watch apps, while the other is an "action" button for fitness tracking. The two-toned design theme, with its bezels, gives the device a classic wristwatch appeal. With a 500mAh battery, the wearable is said to deliver up to 100 hours of charge with regular use and comes with a 7.5W VOOC fast charger, which fully charges the device in 60 minutes. The watch is priced at $229 and comes in Forest Green and Gunmetal Gray colorways.</p><p>Lastly, the company also launched the Nord Buds 3 Pro, which comes with studio-grade audio with powerful bass tones and BassWave 2.0 technology. OnePlus stated that the earbuds "come with scenario-based Smart Noise Cancellation, which intelligently detects ambient sounds and selects the most suitable noise reduction mode in real-time to balance noise-canceling effectiveness and convenience." These affordable Buds have triple microphones that promise clear and stable audio while taking voice/video calls.  The new buds come in a pebble-shaped vertical case, which sports a matte finish with some metallic accents. They come in two colorways: Starry Black and Soft Jade.</p>

You probably weren&apos;t affected much (neither was I), but thousands of corporations and businesses were, including the airline and rail industry, bringing transportation and other services to a standstill. </p><p>Needless to say, it was messy and will end up costing the companies affected millions. Messy, expensive technical blunders are fascinating to me and one of the things I think is always worth exploring more. At the risk of sounding like the proverbial Monday morning quarterback, let&apos;s have a look at this one.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>While I think the overall blame must be laid at Microsoft&apos;s feet, the Redmond giant didn&apos;t cause this outage. An optional third-party Windows component from CrowdStrike—another Windows Security vendor—sent out an update that crashed the low-level systems of the affected computers and sent them into the famous Windows blue screen. The only thing Microsoft did wrong was build a system that allows this to happen, but this is also the most important part of what happened. </p><p>That should also be your biggest takeaway from this because the next time it happens—and there will be a next time—you could be affected, and it could be much worse. CrowdStrike may have caused this, but it was Microsoft&apos;s fault.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-cloudstrike-factor-into-all-of-this-2">How does CloudStrike factor into all of this?</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s talk a little more about what CrowdStrike is and why so many big companies use their products. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-us/">the company&apos;s website</a>, CrowdStrike has "redefined security", securing "the most critical areas of risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data." I am definitely not a Windows security professional but I can recognize a sales pitch when I see one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664" name="windows-blue-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A blue screen of death on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure the software offers an important service. I&apos;m equally sure that the decision to use what CrowdStrike offers is financially based as much or more than it is technically. Salesmen exist because they are good at selling a good or service and if the service is legitimate, it&apos;s a lot easier to do.</p>
<p>I have no problem with an entrepreneur finding a way to get the corporate world to buy into their product. I do find two things very concerning here.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, if CrowdStrike offers something so important, why is it not already a part of Windows Server? Microsoft is one of the biggest, and dare I say best, software companies in the world. If there is a legitimate need for a product like the ones CrowdStrike offers, Microsoft could provide it themselves. With Windows Server licensing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/FmEEbV4weBh2TVwpHWhhP7">being so expensive</a>, it probably <em>should</em> be provided.</p><p>My next concern is how an optional piece of software can get such low-level OS access and cripple a machine if it&apos;s corrupt or misconfigured. Microsoft should never allow software from another company to hijack its operating system this way.</p><p>This is why I&apos;ll place the blame for this particular outage on Microsoft even though the company did nothing to directly cause it. I&apos;m always going to hold the best companies to higher standards.</p>
<p>Neither of these ideas is crazy or new. I guarantee that engineers at Microsoft knew this could happen, looked at how it could be prevented, and analyzed what the company needed to do to "fix" them. It&apos;s trendy to hate on the company, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/using-android-microsoft-ecosystem">Microsoft is one of the best companies in the world</a> when it comes to computing, both at the edge and in the cloud. Even if you&apos;re not a fan of its products, you can easily see this. Critical infrastructure depends on Microsoft because it is so good at what it does.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-next-time-2">What about next time?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws" name="bricked-bootloader.jpg" alt="Things can go wrong when rooting your phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough with the amateur analysis, though. This is all concerning because we got off easy this time. Yes, your flight got canceled if you were traveling today, and maybe you had no cell service on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your new phone</a> for a few hours this morning. If you were lucky, you got to slack off instead of work at your office this morning. If you&apos;re unlucky, you get to spend the weekend repairing the damage the outage caused to your IT department.</p>
<p>What if, the next time, the national power grid goes down? Imagine an entire country in the dark for an extended amount of time because of a misconfigured kernel module from a third-party vendor. I know there are multiple fail-safes in place to prevent anything like this, but you should never say never. </p><p>More realistically, what if the next global outage affects mobile devices? Forget the inconvenience of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-not-just-you-gmail-youtube-and-other-google-services-are-down-right-now">Gmail</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158595/imessage-down-outage-iphone-apple-text-messages">iMessage</a> going down and instead imagine every Android or iPhone or Surface laptop crapping out for a few hours. It&apos;s easy to say it would be an opportunity to go outside and get some much-needed fresh air, but billions and billions of dollars would be lost, and entire companies would go bankrupt because of it.</p>
<p>I&apos;m certain that incidents like what happened this week are great educational tools and help prevent a more serious incident from happening. I hope the right people—the ones who control the purse strings—use them as a learning opportunity.</p>

Unfortunately, Google Maps is so ubiquitous that its recommendations can <em>cause</em> traffic-filled nightmares just as often as they help people escape them. </p><p>A few weeks back, I had a tech demo at Logitech&apos;s offices in North San Jose, which I scheduled early to beat the rush. I left at 1 pm with 50 miles and a little over an hour to get home. As I took off, I saw a warning about an accident on 680N, so I turned on an audiobook and got ready for a brief slowdown.</p><p>It took two and a half hours to make it back. I had traveled from 680 to 238 to 84, then onto surface streets for over ten miles, then to 580, 13, 24, and finally back to 680 before coming to my exit. <strong>Seven</strong> different highways (if you count 680 twice) full to the brim with rerouted Google Maps users.</p><p>Here&apos;s what happened. As I drove up 680, Google Maps warned me that the accident had caused a fifteen-minute slowdown and that exiting up ahead would save time. Since I didn&apos;t have anyone there to check Google&apos;s new route, I trusted the app&apos;s advice and exited. </p><p>So did everyone else, it turns out! The siren call of a "Faster route available" sent thousands of drivers onto a two-lane street with only one exit lane for a turn two miles down the road. Everyone crammed into that lane while all the drivers unfamiliar with this new route frantically cut in line miles ahead, causing a huge slowdown. After about 20 minutes to drive a couple of miles, Maps rerouted me again.</p><p>I won&apos;t bore you with a long, drawn-out description of a long, drawn-out drive. Suffice it to say that I very much regretted taking Google Maps&apos; advice instead of just sticking it out on the direct route. That would have probably saved me an extra hour of needless zig-zagging across the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Every friend or family member I&apos;ve asked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>&apos; "faster route available" had an immediate traffic horror story to share, where the app sent them on some obscure side-street route to avoid gridlock on a highway or expressway, only for things to slow to a crawl because a ton of other drivers took the exact same route on a road not designed for heavy use. I&apos;ve also seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1dr08ef/google_maps_rerouting_is_awful/">r/Google Maps</a> posts complaining about this.</p><p>Other times, people will carefully choose a specific route for a road trip or long haul with better scenery, more EV stations or rest stops, or better conditions for driving a large truck or RV — only for Google Maps to auto-reroute them to something "faster" unless you cancel the switch quickly enough. I&apos;ve found several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/161fw2d/google_maps_absolutely_needs_a_setting_to_turn/">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/15y4ger/how_to_stop_google_from_changing_to_fastest_route/">posts</a> criticizing this very issue, with people suggesting tricks like adding extra stops just to prevent auto-rerouting.</p><p>Google Maps occasionally suggests that I "exit hop" or "freeway jump" in congested traffic, meaning I take an exit but stay in the left lane and reenter the freeway a mile ahead. It&apos;s a jerk move that only slows traffic down in the long run, but it&apos;s never clear that&apos;s what you&apos;re agreeing to do when Maps reroutes you.</p>

<p>My main problem is that Google Maps&apos; algorithm doesn&apos;t seem to account for its own power to change the flow of traffic based on its wide reach. According to a MarketWatch study, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-popularity-united-states-study">70% of U.S. drivers use Google Maps</a> despite iPhones&apos; popularity here. So by observing that a road is empty, Maps changes that reality and shifts a ton of traffic to that new road, even though it ultimately won&apos;t be much faster for the <del>lemmings</del> drivers following its advice.</p><p>I emailed a Google Maps contact and asked them about the algorithm. Does it account for current traffic levels or a road&apos;s maximum capacity when it recommends a faster route? Are they aware of the drawbacks of the "faster route available" system—its engineers live in California, after all—and will Google&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> pivot lead to better recs down the line? As of yet, I haven&apos;t heard back.</p><p>Anecdotally, most of the people I&apos;ve asked about this say that they don&apos;t let Maps reroute them anymore. They choose a route when they leave, and if it slows down, they stick to the current route because they don&apos;t trust mid-route changes to pay off. Despite Google Maps&apos; smart reputation, this is one area where people have lost or are losing faith. </p><p>Many of Google&apos;s recent Maps updates have focused on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">UI overhaul</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-gen-ai-search-maps">GenAI recommendations on where to go</a>. But rather than have Maps telling me about "places with a vintage vibe in SF," I&apos;d rather it focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>In my mind, Google Maps needs the "with great power comes great responsibility" talk. Sending a simultaneous signal to every Google Maps driver to converge on some backroad detour is a recipe for bottlenecks and further accidents. If Google can figure out how to be more prudent with its "Faster route available" recommendations, that&apos;ll make everyone safer and happier.</p>
