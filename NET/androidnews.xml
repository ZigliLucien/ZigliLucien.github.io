<p>Screenshots are possible on all phones. Once you have all the necessary screenshots, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-quickly-find-screenshots-google-photos">access them in Google Photos</a>. It&apos;s good that you have different methods, just in case you&apos;re having issues with one.Â You might be using Google Photos more often since you might not resist taking many pictures of the latest Pixel 9 series phones, including the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL. Older-gen Pixels are spectacular at photography too, so this applies to Google phones universally.</p><p>If you want the Pixel with the best camera out of the series, you can choose the 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL. They have the same specs and share a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera with autofocus, and a 48MP telephoto camera. The Pixel 9 Pro lacks a 48MP telephoto camera.</p><p>To access your screenshots, you can take the long or short way byÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-new-screenshot-folder-shortcut" target="_blank">long-pressing on the Google Photos app icon</a>.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bluetooth and other types of mobile device trackers are great for being able to locate and retrieve your lost items. These small Bluetooth tags are designed to attach to keys or placed in wallets, purses, or backpacks to keep track of valuables. Some people even use them on pet collars. But they can also be used by people for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Individuals can place a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth tracker</a> in your personal belongings to be able to track your location, unbeknownst to you and without your consent. They can be hidden away in a jacket pocket, for example, in the depths of your backpack, or even in your vehicle. Thankfully, thereâs a way to verify this isnât being done to you. In fact, your smartphone automatically notifies you if it detects an unknown one so you can take the appropriate steps.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-unknown-tracker-alert-2">What is an unknown tracker alert?</h2>
<p>If you turn this feature on for your device, you will receive an alert on your phone advising you that someone elseâs tracking device is traveling with you. This is a good way to help someone find something they lost. Maybe your wife forgot she gave you her keys, for example, or she left her headphones with a tracker in your car. But it also alerts you if someone placed a tracker on your person as soon as the owner of said tracker has moved their device outside of the range of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, putting your phone into Airplane Mode, turning off Bluetooth, or even shutting down location services wonât stop the person from being able to follow you (and thus the tracker). Unknown tracker alerts are typically on by default, but you can double-check in your phoneâs settings.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your device.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Unknown tracker alerts</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Allow alerts</strong> if it isnât already on.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-manually-scan-for-unknown-trackers-2">How to manually scan for unknown trackers</h2>
<p>If you want to verify that no unknown trackers are near nor on or in your belongings and you havenât received an alert to indicate it, you can run a manual scan to be sure.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> on your device.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Unknown tracker alerts</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-find-an-unknown-tracker-2">What to do if you find an unknown tracker</h2>
<p>If you find an unknown tracker from a brand like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tile-bluetooth-trackers-review">Tile</a>, Apple, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-review">Samsung</a>, or others, and you believe someone has used it for the purpose of tracking you, tap the unknown tracker notification and a map will open. Here, youâll see where it has been following you. Select <strong>Play sound</strong> to emit an audible beep from the tracker, which will first help you find where it is. Continue to do this and follow the sound to locate the device. Once you find the tracker, select <strong>Next steps</strong>.</p><p>While you might be tempted to disable it right away, if you feel you could be in danger, contact local law enforcement first. Disabling the tracker could return the device to factory settings, which would remove the history of ownership. If you want to disable it for any reason (note that the owner would still be able to see your last location), this usually can be done by opening the tracker and removing its battery.</p><p>Some trackers, however, like certain Tile or Pebblebee models, donât have replaceable or removable batteries. In this case, only the owner can disable it. If youâre concerned, take a photo of the device, including its serial number, leave it behind, and head to a police station or contact local police or a trusted friend or family member for help.</p><p>Keep in mind as well that tracking is not foolproof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-responds-find-my-device-criticism">recent tests of Google&apos;s Find My Device network</a>, we found that while friends were alerted that unknown trackers were following them, the owner did not hear anything about the locations for weeks. What&apos;s more, Google Find My Device doesn&apos;t always show the exact location of the tracker on the map in the app. This means bad actors might not be able to follow you as well as they&apos;d like anyway.</p><p>So, since that system relies on kind-hearted people finding the tracker and getting in touch with the owner, it&apos;s set to work as intended. And it has less chance of being used for bad reasons. Google tells us the company is working on improving the crowdfunded network. As it gets more precise, you can be more diligent by learning how to determine if unknown trackers are following you.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">best Bluetooth trackers</a> are designed to help you keep track of lost or misplaced items. Sadly, sometimes people can use them for nefarious purposes. But keeping an eye on what trackers are near you if you ever feel unsafe is a good way to prevent that.</p>

<ul><li>Mobvoi has started rolling out its Wear OS 4 update, which has been a long time coming for TicWatch Pro 5 and Pro 5 Enduro owners.</li><li>The update offers two new features and several enhancements for TicExercise and TicMotion.</li><li>Mobvoi is a year late in bringing its Wear OS 4 update to Pro 5 owners, which sucks because everyone is getting excited about Wear OS 5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s finally here; Mobvoi has started rolling out its major Wear OS 4 update for all TicWatch Pro 5 series owners.</p><p>Mobvoi stated in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/au/blog/Wear-OS-4-Upgrade-and-Enhanced-Functionality-for-TicWatch-Pro-5-Series?_id=66d6bfb9a743410012e83485">a blog post</a> that its Wear OS 4 update is starting to arrive on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Pro 5 Enduro</a>. These devices have been rocking Wear OS 3.5 for a while now and this next OS release kicks things off with new features. Mobvoi states both watches are preparing to receive "Backup and Restore."</p><p>This will let users seamlessly "backup your data and settings from your old watch while keeping all of your data, settings, and watch faces in place." Phone Transfer is a lifesaver as users can easily swap their watch from one phone to another <em>without </em>factory resetting it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> update brings a long list of enhancements for the TicWatches, beginning with TicExercise. There are 25 new exercises users can start getting into with their devices. A few include hiking, pickleball, CrossFit, and stair stepper. Workout data for outside exercises will display more data like GPS, distance, and speed.</p><p>Customizable workout lists and auto-pause join alongside changes in the UI and "calorie calculation."</p><p>TicMotion picks up a few enhancements for cycling detection, enhanced data detection, and the ultra-low power display now shows a workout tile.</p><p>A few more updates are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Multi-language Translation Enhancements</strong>: Optimizations to the translation of multiple languages.</li><li><strong>Watch Face Customization</strong>: Customizable watch face styles, colors, and complications. (TicWatch Pro 5 owners)</li><li><strong>Custom Button Functionality</strong>: Side button now supports customization to open a user-defined app (default is the recent apps list). (TicWatch Pro 5 owners)</li><li><strong>Other Bug Fixes</strong>: General bug fixes and stability improvements.</li></ul>

<p>Mobvoi adds that its Wear OS 4 update brings the latest September 2024 patch for its two Pro 5 watches. More importantly, the update has started today (Sept 3); however, it may take some time before it hits your watch.</p><p>It&apos;s no hiding that Mobvoi TicWatch owners have become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-waiting-game">weary of the Wear OS waiting game</a>. The company was incredibly slow in rolling out the Wear OS 3 update and that continued as we&apos;re just getting Wear OS 4. Mobvoi kickstarted its beta period for the software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">earlier this year</a> in April.</p><p>TicWatch users were late to the party as Wear OS 4 originally launched a year ago. What makes things strange is that we&apos;re waiting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a> to start hitting more devices. It seems that Google is starting to get the memo and bring more consistency to its Wear OS ecosystem. This could mean we&apos;re in for major yearly Wear OS updates, though we&apos;ll have to see how things go.</p><p>This also means that Mobvoi will likely have to step things up as we progress.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's rumored Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim" device is now said to be called the "Special Edition," because even the premium variant isn't all that thin.</li><li>Perks of picking the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition over the standard model could include a better rear camera system and marginally-improved thickness.</li><li>Samsung will still have a hard time convincing users to pick the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition over the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the OnePlus Open.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> even officially launched, we were hearing rumors of a thinner and more premium variant set for release in the fall. At the time, it was being referred to as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim," due to it being a thinner version of the regular model. In the time since, both Google and Honor released similar foldables that are thinner than both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the unreleased model, per reports.</p><p>That&apos;s why Samsung may be switching up the name of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable</a>. Indications are now that it will be called the Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Special Edition," which seems like a better name than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. Samsung couldn&apos;t call its upcoming foldable the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim because it simply isn&apos;t thin enough, and it would&apos;ve been ridiculed. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">Honor already gloriously trolled Samsung</a> for the thickness of its latest foldable with a tiny message roasting the Galaxy Z Fold 6.Â </p><p>But for similar reasons, the Special Edition might not be very special. In fact, it may end up just being the Galaxy Z Fold 6 model that Samsung should&apos;ve released in the first place. The latest leaks come from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1828490254686237142" target="_blank">Evan Blass on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, although his account is currently private. They point to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition including a slightly slimmer form factor and an upgraded rear camera system.</p><p>That last bit could be crucial, because there isn&apos;t a single foldable available in North America that has a camera system capable of competing with those of flagships. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> has a worse camera than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a worse camera than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the OnePlus Open has a worse camera than the OnePlus 12. Samsung is the worst offender, because its $1,900 folding phone has the same rear camera system as the $800 base Galaxy S24. It&apos;s also going on its third year without changes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Xj3YsQESa6GgbXpfgX3a7H" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16x9.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xj3YsQESa6GgbXpfgX3a7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest report from Blass indicates that the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s 50MP main camera could be swapped for a 200MP sensor on the Special Edition. If you recall, the same was reported when a Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Ultra" model was rumored. This sensor might also support 2x optical zoom, and it&apos;s possible it is the same ISOCELL HP3 camera within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. For now, it&apos;s unclear whether the Special Edition might receive telephoto or ultrawide camera upgrades.Â </p><p>If the Special Edition indeed features a 200MP main camera sensor, and the marketing surrounds that change, it would make a lot more sense than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim branding.Â There have been mixed reports about the thickness of Samsung&apos;s next foldable, but the most recent figures are that it measures 11.5mm when folded. That still puts it considerably behind the Honor Magic V3 and even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.Â </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens-angled.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdQA2KorHMoyDwaUUqca7d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have no doubts that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition will be a better foldable than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the details surrounding both models underscore how far behind Samsung is in foldable technology. Neither the standard Galaxy Z Fold 6 nor the rumored Special Edition variant are set to challenge top foldables from Honor, Vivo, and others. It won&apos;t even top the charts in every area stateside, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> still dominating in their own ways.Â </p><p>If anything, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should become the budget Samsung foldable we&apos;ve always wanted, with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition becoming the premium variant. Samsung&apos;s current foldable is far too expensive for the features it offers, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition could be more worthy of that $1,900 price point. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t expect Samsung to shave dollars off the Galaxy Z Fold 6 price tag anytime soon. In fact, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition might be exclusive to Korea and China, so it won&apos;t meaningfully impact North American sales at all.Â </p><p>To really be competitive, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition would need a more powerful camera system, a much slimmer chassis, and a better form factor. Built-in S Pen storage would be an unlikely but significant feature. While the Special Edition might offer one or two of these, it&apos;s not going to offer all of them. Even Samsung&apos;s best is behind the curve in 2024 when it comes to foldables.Â </p>

<p>Before you do anything, you&apos;ll want to make sure you understand how to wear the Galaxy Ring correctly. While this sounds silly at first, the Ring&apos;s orientation on your finger actually does matter. That&apos;s because the sensors inside the Galaxy Ring are designed to be worn on the underside of your finger for the most accurate measurements.</p><p>When wearing your Galaxy Ring, ensure that the indicator line sits roughly at the mid-point on the underside of your finger. If you need a visual, the image above should help it make sense. Check on your ring periodically throughout the day to ensure this indicator line is on the underside of your finger to ensure the most accurate measurements.</p>

<p>One of the Samsung Galaxy Ring&apos;s coolest features is totally unique among the best smart rings available, but it&apos;s also only available when you pair a Galaxy Ring with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> running One UI 6.1.1 and higher. That&apos;s because Samsung bakes these features into its OS at the system level.</p><p>Gestures let you quickly dismiss an alarm with a double-pinch of your fingers. You can also take a picture remotely with the same gesture, making it easy to prop your phone against something and get a group photo with everyone in it.</p><p>Note that you cannot enable gestures on both the Galaxy Watch <em>and</em> Galaxy Ring, so you&apos;ll need to choose between the two. Here&apos;s how to enable gestures on your Galaxy Ring.</p>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Galaxy Wearables app</strong>. On Samsung phones, this app is just called <strong>Wearables</strong>.</li><li>If you have multiple Galaxy wearable devices, <strong>select Galaxy Ring</strong>. Otherwise, continue on to the next step.</li><li>At the bottom of the main screen, tap <strong>Gestures</strong>.</li><li>Select with gestures you'd like to enable by <strong>tapping the toggle</strong> next to each option.</li><li>To test out each feature, <strong>tap the name</strong> of the feature and follow the on-screen prompts.</li></ol>

<p>Another feature unique to the Samsung Galaxy Ring is the ability to remotely find it. The Galaxy Wearables app can be used to blink the LEDs on the undersideâmaking it easy to find if it got dropped under a couch or somethingâand pairing it with a Samsung Galaxy phone will even let you track the Ring&apos;s last known location.</p><p>On a Samsung phone, you&apos;ll want to make sure to open the <strong>Find app</strong> and walk through the initial setup process. This will let you find any Samsung device you lose.</p><p>If you lose your Ring, we have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring">how to find your lost Galaxy Ring</a>, but here&apos;s a brief synopsis:</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is built to be charged only once per week, but did you know that you can extend that time even further? When you wear a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch at the same timeâlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, for exampleâthe Samsung Health app will only use the sensors on the Watch.</p><p>Since many people take off their watches from time to time but typically leave their rings on, this ensures that 24/7 health tracking can take place without wasting the battery life of both devices. You don&apos;t need to configure anything for this to happen. Just ensure you have your Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Ring are paired to the same phone with the same Samsung account.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gUeamopS6V3k87J2ByfJpi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-charging-case-10.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring and its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUeamopS6V3k87J2ByfJpi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like a pair of wireless earbuds, the Samsung Galaxy Ring ships with a handy charging case to ensure you can easily keep it juiced up on the go. The charging case has its own battery that is designed to keep your Galaxy Ring charged for an extra two weeks beyond the one-week battery life of the Ring, but there are a few important things to know about the case.</p><p>When you open the case <em>without</em> the Galaxy Ring inside, a circular LED strip around the inside will light up to show the battery percentage. This is displayed in a circle, so a full circle is 100% charged while and empty circle is fully emptied. Pressing the button inside the middle of the Ring pedestal will also illuminate this charging LED ring in case you missed it while opening.</p>
<p>Opening the case with the Ring on the pedestal will illuminate to show the Ring&apos;s remaining battery percentage. We recommend closing the case, then opening it again to ensure that you&apos;re looking at either the Ring or the case&apos;s battery life.</p><p>I&apos;ve had a number of times where I put the Galaxy Ring in the case, only to come back an hour later and find that it hadn&apos;t charged. To ensure this doesn&apos;t happen to you, make sure you open the case, wait until the case LED battery lights turn off, then put your Ring in and wait for the case to show the Ring&apos;s battery life. Occasionally, I found that flipping the Ring over would help ensure that it&apos;s charging.</p>

<p>Like other wearables, the Galaxy Ring can be used to deliver notifications to periodically stand up or walk around every 50 minutes via the Samsung Health app. But these notifications can be frustrating when you&apos;re trying to work, are in a meeting or a class where you can&apos;t stand up and walk around, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-wasnt-built-for-people-in-wheelchairs">even downright offensive</a> if you&apos;re physically unable to stand up.</p><p>That&apos;s why configuring inactivity alerts is important. By default, they&apos;re enabled during "non-work hours," defined as 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You can customize this period to better fit your needs by following these steps:</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring isn&apos;t really built for working out, but it can be used to automatically detect some kinds of workouts.

<p>In our testing, we found that the Samsung Galaxy Ring was one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">the most accurate step-count trackers</a> you can buy. But while step tracking can be a fun game to play every day, it&apos;s <em>even more fun</em> when you can play it alongside friends. You can issue individual challenges to friends, either to get to a certain step count first or get the most steps in any given period of time.</p><p>Peer pressure <em>can</em> be good sometimes, and this is certainly one of them. Here&apos;s how to issue step challenges to your friends:</p>

<p>One of the key features of the Samsung Galaxy Ring is its ability to track sleep since it&apos;s so darn comfortable to wear to bedâunlike a smart watch. But only basic sleep tracking features are enabled out of the box. Things like blood oxygen monitoring, skin temperature during sleep, and even snore detection all have to be enabled manually.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to enable advanced sleep tracking on a Samsung Galaxy Ring:</p>

<p>At its core, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is a heart rate monitoring tool. While it can&apos;t detect AFib, it can alert you if your heart rate gets too low or too high unintentionally. By default, the Ring is designed to deliver a notification via the Samsung Health app when your heart rate stays above 120 BPM or goes below 40 BPM for longer than 10 minutes.</p><p>Since everyone&apos;s health is a bit different, you might need to customize these numbers, or you might want to turn the feature off entirely.

<p>The Samsung Health app is a powerful tool for organizing many different health metrics in one place, but it can be a bit overwhelming for new users. Samsung tries to make this better by asking you for your focus during the initial setup, and while that helps, not everything in the default layout will be useful for everyone.</p><p>That&apos;s why customizing the layout is great. If you&apos;re a runner or regularly work out, you might want the workout panel right up top so you can quickly see it eery day. Or maybe you just prefer to use your Galaxy Ring for sleep tracking and don&apos;t care about much else. Here&apos;s how to customize the Samsung Health dashboard:</p>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Samsung Health app</strong>.</li><li><strong>Press and hold any tile </strong>on the home screen to bring up the editing function.</li><li><strong>Press and hold any tile</strong> and slide it up or down in the list to move it around.</li><li><strong>Tap the minus button</strong> next to any tile to remove it from the list.</li><li><strong>Tap the plus button</strong> in the top right to add additional tiles to the list.</li></ol>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 is finally rolling out to Pixel phones soon and hitting other brands over the next few months.</li><li>The latest version of Android brings better media and camera features, like HDR management, improved audio, and low-light enhancements.</li><li>It also introduces âPrivate Spaceâ for your apps, easier sign-ins with passkeys, and alerts if apps detect recording.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is finally out, and itâll be rolling out to Pixel phones in the next few weeks and will reach other devices over the next few months.</p><p>With 2024 wrapping up, itâs no surprise that smartphone OS updates are rolling out. And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series having made their debut last month, it makes total sense for Google to drop the final version of Android 15 now.</p><p>For Pixel users, that means the latest Android version will hit their phones in no time. Plus, Android 15 is now open-source on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), so other device makers can start bringing it to their devices too.</p><p>Android 15 promises to make things smoother for users, give developers better tools, and step up privacy and security. It also adds new features for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages.</p><p>The new Android version also upgrades your media and camera experiences. It lets you manage HDR settings to prevent SDR content from appearing washed out and adjusts audio levels for better sound. Low Light Boost improves previews and QR code scans in dim lighting, and you get finer control over flash intensity for perfect shots.</p><p>Android 15 also makes multitasking smoother with better large-screen support. You can now save split-screen app combinations and pin the taskbar. Plus, apps now default to an edge-to-edge display when targeting SDK 35 for a more immersive experience.</p><p>Privacy and security are still on Google&apos;s radar with Android 15. Now you get a âPrivate Spaceâ for your secret apps, sign-ins are a breeze with passkeys, and apps will even give you a heads-up if they catch someone snooping.</p><p>Android 15 is playing nice with app compatibility too. Most changes are opt-in until apps update to SDK version 35, so developers have plenty of time to get their act together.</p><p>As mentioned previously, Android 15 is hitting Pixel devices in the next few weeks. After that, it&apos;ll start showing up on phones from Samsung, Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Sony, TECNO, Vivo, and Xiaomi over the next few months.</p>

                    <p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro takes the Pixel 9 up a notch with a sharper, brighter display, a better selfie camera, and extra RAM and storage, which gamers and multitaskers will love. But beyond that, it's mostly the same phoneâso much so that the cases for one will fit the other.</p></p>

<p>For your safety, Androidâs Earthquake Alert System is now available in every U.S. state. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-earthquake-alerts-expansion/">hopes to warn users</a> about an impending quake <em>before </em>it happens. This alert system piggybacks off crowd-sourced earthquake detection technology to get the job done.</p><p>In 2022, Google announced at I/O that it was expanding its earthquake warnings to several high-risk areas. Now, the alert system covers the entire U.S. You can also check out tips on what to do if you get an alert.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> preparing to arrive in consumer hands, Google is rolling out some new Maps features for Wear OS. The update brings offline map viewing for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. If youâve downloaded a map on your phone, you can access it directly from Google Maps on your wearable device.</p><p>Additionally, the feature brings voice search and the ability to "view your surroundings" by tapping your watch face.</p>

<p>Android&apos;s accessibility feature, TalkBack can now offer users a "detailed description" of an image. To do this, Google says the feature now leverages Gemini models on "supported devices" to get it done. The AI model is said to describe the contents of an image for low-vision or blind users.</p><p>Gemini in TalkBack supports photos in your camera roll, those received via text, product images from websites, and social media. Google is also expected to expand TalkBack&apos;s array of features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">for Android 15</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Chrome on Android picks up the ability to read what&apos;s listed on a webpage. Users can set how fast or slow the AI reads alongside a desired language and voice. Google states users can listen to full articles, recipes, and more.</p>

We quite enjoy Amazfit smartwatches, and so we were naturally excited about the prospect of an Amazfit smart ring. However, this first attempt from the company feels very much like that, and not really in a good way.</p><p>With impressive smart rings like the Oura Ring and even those from relatively unknown companies like RingConn and Ultrahuman, the Amazfit Helio Ring feels like a product that has so much potential but fails to quite reach it. It has a number of rather obvious shortcomings while being one of the few smart rings on the market to throw a subscription in your face, even if the company says it&apos;s not necessary.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t things to like about the Amazfit Helio Ring, and the company has been adding new features in the time since its launch. The company also smartly leverages AI to merge data from its smartwatches to get a full look at your health and performance. However, the ring feels more like a beta product, and I&apos;m not sure the price tag really matches the value.</p>

<p>The Amazfit Helio Ring was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-launch-ces-2024">announced</a> in January 2024 but did not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">go on sale in the U.S.</a> until May of the same year. The ring retails for $299, although it can be found at a discount at some retailers, going as low as $199.</p><p>The Helio Ring is available in one color and finish, although it can be purchased in three sizes: 8, 10, and 12.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazfit-helio-ring-what-i-like"><span>Amazfit Helio Ring: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QenLxk5ptGPSR2bWpjc76P" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-11.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring on a finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QenLxk5ptGPSR2bWpjc76P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Amazfit Helio Ring may not be the thinnest, slimmest, or lightest smart ring on the market, but the overall design is simple and elegant. I rather like the feel and finish of the titanium alloy, especially with the textured top section that lets you know whether or not the ring is on the correct path. The brushed metal not only looks great, but it handles the trials and tribulations of daily life better than my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> or other smart rings that have options for glossy finishes, as they tend to scuff and scratch very easily. In my time with the Amazfit Helio Ring, I haven&apos;t had to worry about that, despite wearing it during workouts.</p><p>Additionally, neither the weight nor the thickness bothers me. Perhaps I&apos;ve gotten used to the feel of smart rings, but the Amazfit Helio Ring doesn&apos;t feel as heavy as it looks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v3Bv8aqRLQjcM4Vujvednh" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-06.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring with the Zepp app on the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3Bv8aqRLQjcM4Vujvednh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the actual ring, the Zepp companion app is also quite nice and has a very easy-to-use layout that you can customize to your liking. Each metric gets its own card, and they can be arranged in a way that makes sense for what you&apos;re focused on most; I keep my Readiness score at the top, followed by my workout history for a quick glance at my week, and then a Training Recovery Card, followed by other individual metrics.</p><p>The bottom has just four tabs for quick navigation to your sleep and workout data, as well as your profile. The latter option lets you view and add devices to the app if you have a smart ring and Amazfit smartwatch, and you can dive into each device to enable or disable health features and update the firmware. You can also quickly jump to each device in your app from the Home tab just by tapping their respective icon in the top left corner.</p><p>The app will inform you on how to wear the ring correctly, provide daily use tips, and more so that you can understand the ins and outs of using the ring. Additionally, you can set daily goals like target steps, weight, and sleep. The Zepp app also supports third-party app linking, with popular options like Strava and Adidas Running.</p>

<p>One feature that was added in August was a Find Device function, which will turn on the green LED to hopefully make the ring easier to find. This is a function I first saw on the Samsung Galaxy Ring, and I thought it was pretty genius since I have a tendency to misplace my smart rings. How helpful this is remains to be seen, but it&apos;s better than nothing (looking at you, Oura) since a ring can&apos;t exactly emit any audible sounds.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazfit-helio-ring-health-tracking"><span>Amazfit Helio Ring: Health tracking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rd6RoLiG5b52gpqoy2WLqL" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-07.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring with the Zepp app on the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rd6RoLiG5b52gpqoy2WLqL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Health tracking is pretty standard on the Helio Ring. It has a PPG heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, and EDA sensor. It&apos;s capable of monitoring blood oxygen levels, stress, and menstrual cycles, which is par for the course when it comes to smart rings. That is to say, none of it&apos;s particularly groundbreaking, but it will give you the information you need.</p><p>Sleep tracking doesn&apos;t feel as detailed as what you&apos;d get on other rings, but I think that&apos;s largely because the information is presented in such a way that makes it easy to see how you slept. You get a sleep score based on the various factors, and so far it closely matches the scores I would get from my Oura Ring and Fitbit. You can also expand the sleep stages graph for a better visual representation of your total sleep time, or you can refer to the individual cards to see how long you were in each sleep stage.</p><p>In addition to heart rate variability, one interesting feature is the Sleep breathing quality, which is currently in beta and can help detect signs and symptoms related to sleep apnea. The Helio Ring will look out for and monitor the number of "episodes" you have during your sleep, which could be handy for people who suspect they may suffer from sleep apnea or are trying to track and lessen their symptoms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="Q8RGyY5QmiXgoi4ZDgaq2T" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-tabs.jpg" alt="The Zepp app, home, sleep, and workout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q8RGyY5QmiXgoi4ZDgaq2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Workout tracking is pretty basic, which is usually the case for smart rings since these are more focused on health and not exactly targeted for fitness use. However, there are several workouts you can track from the app when using just the Helio Ring, including running, walking, and cycling. I actually like that you can specify if you&apos;re running outside or on a treadmill, and the app will use your phone&apos;s GPS if it&apos;s the former.</p><p>That said, there&apos;s no way to actually track things like lifting weights, which I&apos;m more likely to do than go on a run. That&apos;s where a smartwatch comes in, and it&apos;s something Amazfit is counting on. The company is leveraging some useful AI techniques that will include and de-duplicate data added from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit smartwatch</a> so that none of it overlaps. That way, you can track a workout on the watch and then track a run later with the ring (or wearing both), and the app will fuse the data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zoDxAZjaukBRhhVhEUKbY3" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-13.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring next to the T-Rex Pro and Razr Plus 2024 with the Zepp app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoDxAZjaukBRhhVhEUKbY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, I spoke to Gregory Heard, product manager for the Helio Ring, about the differences between using a ring and watch when tracking data and whether one is "better" than another. He says that determining which is "better" sort of misses the point, and that they&apos;re meant to be used interchangably.</p><p>"Generally speaking, both rings and watches are great technologies for understanding your body, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, and tracking your athletic performance, both in real-time and over time," Heard told me in an email. "But they excel in different situations."</p><p>"Many people find watches uncomfortable for sleeping, but rings are a great for this.Â Conversely, a sports watch is much better for your workouts because it displays all your metrics during activity, and doesnât have to be tethered to your phone for things like GPS tracking.Â We consider them different tools for different jobs."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="n4SQJGqqmXNSwdPksBkWDS" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-workout-tracking.jpg" alt="Workout tracking in the Zepp app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4SQJGqqmXNSwdPksBkWDS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a smart approach since it&apos;s how I&apos;ve found myself using smart rings. With Oura, the extra data comes from app integrations like Strava, which aren&apos;t always reliable or will duplicate data that the ring has already tracked itself, which I sometimes find frustrating.</p><p>For the purposes of the review, I wore the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-pro-review">Amazfit T-Rex Pro</a> for weightlifting and the ring for other things like running and sleeping, and I wasn&apos;t worried about any of the data being duplicated. I like that it even lets you choose which device to use to track your heart rate when you select the Helio-supported workouts.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s technically no automatic workout tracking, but the ring will log certain activities in your calorie card, which I find interesting. It will tell me if I was walking slow or fast, or if I was doing a light activity.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Helio Ring has many basic health-tracking features but misses out on some big ones or relies on a connected smartwatch to fill in the blanks.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As for step counting, the Helio Ring performed surprisingly well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">multi-smartwatch/smart ring step test</a>, logging the fewest errors of any other device. There are times when I&apos;ve noticed it will deviate by a few hundred steps when compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, so I always caution that you should take smart ring step counts with a grain of salt, but overall, I find that it doesn&apos;t suffer as much from the phantom steps that my colleagues have complained about with other rings, where they will find thousands of steps logged while barely having moved during the day.</p><p>The ring has an Auto Emotions Monitor, which will check your emotional well-being throughout the day and help you understand your stress.

<p>Unfortunately, one of the Helio Ring&apos;s biggest downsides is its battery life. While many of the more popular models last seven days or more, the Helio Ring only lasts four days, and even that&apos;s not a given. Toggle on some of the health tracking features, and you&apos;ll be met with a warning that they will "greatly" or "significantly" reduce battery life.</p><p>Four days is much better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, particularly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">those running Wear OS</a>, but it&apos;s woefully behind other smart rings. Given its size, I&apos;m surprised Amazfit wasn&apos;t able to fit a larger battery into the ring.</p><p>Additionally, when it&apos;s time to charge the ring, the included charging puck is a bit frustrating to use. It&apos;s shaped largely like the one that comes with the Oura Ring, but the divots on the puck to fit the ring sensors make it annoyingly hard to just drop the ring on and charge. I find myself fiddling with it more often than now.</p><p>Another problem is that this ring is only available in three sizes, while other devices are offered in eight or nine sizes. That&apos;s one more than at launch, but it&apos;s extremely limited when smart rings are expected to have a certain fit to work properly. Those with smaller fingers may find themselves out of luck if they&apos;re looking to purchase a model, while those with larger fingers may find it difficult to get a proper fit on the recommended digits.</p><p>In addition, you only get one color and finish, so there isn&apos;t much in the way of selection when buying it. While I like the design, it would be nice to have a silver or rose gold option for anyone who doesn&apos;t care for the gold-esque Titanium color.</p><p>If Amazfit is hoping to sell a lot of these, it certainly doesn&apos;t show.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2310px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.61%;"><img id="eJ56iQZVFfZt9n63iRwu9U" name="Amazfit-Zepp-app-subsctiptions.jpg" alt="The Zepp app subscriptions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eJ56iQZVFfZt9n63iRwu9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2310" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, while Amazfit highlights that there are "no subscriptions required," there are still subscriptions, and the app does a good job of hiding them and popping them up when you least expect it. Want deeper insights into your sleep or access to your weekly fitness report? Sign up for not one, but <em>two</em> different prescriptions. Even the AI chatbot Aura is limited in it functionality until you sign up.</p><p>It&apos;s quite clever to hide these subscriptions in the app, but while they&apos;re not necessary for most functions, it still feels quite disingenuous to have them when most other smart rings, aside from Oura, don&apos;t require subscriptions.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4218px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="hxpA2yjnoVto9ch4tRyFBT" name="Amazfit-Helio-Ring-review-08.jpg" alt="The Amazfit Helio Ring and Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hxpA2yjnoVto9ch4tRyFBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4218" height="2373" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re in the market for a smart ring, there are quite a few to choose from, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 has pretty much set the standard. Despite launching in 2021 and being a bit rough around the edges, the ring has come a long way, adding more and more features throughout the years and essentially being the one to beat. That said, it does get expensive and can go for more than $500, depending on the finish you get. However, it&apos;s much more feature-rich and has a battery that will last about a week.</p><p>If you want something with even more battery life, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a> can last up to 12 days on a single charge and comes with a charging case. It also comes in more sizes and finishes, and it supports sleep apnea detection. Unfortunately, you won&apos;t find automatic workout tracking in any form, and there&apos;s no connection to smartwatches that the ring can take advantage of.</p><p>That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> comes in, which is the current newcomer in the smart ring space. While the ring is a bit more expensive and rough around the edges, it does come with the benefit of Galaxy AI and even has unique smartphone gestures that let you capture photos remotely or turn off alarms.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own an Amazfit smartwatch</li><li>You may suffer from sleep apnea</li><li>You want a ring that will track your stress and emotions</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a smart ring with great battery life</li><li>You have smaller fingers</li><li>You won't own an Amazfit smartwatch</li></ul>
<p>Just like how some of the features are in beta, the Helio Ring itself feels like a beta product. There&apos;s no denying there&apos;s quite a bit of potential here with how the app combines data from a smartwatch to contribute to your Readiness score, but the device just falls behind on some of the most important aspects of a smart ring. Battery life is the biggest thing, and while it&apos;s not terrible, it&apos;s still behind the pack.</p><p>There also just isn&apos;t much choice when buying a Helio Ring, which makes me feel like little thought was put into making a smart ring. That&apos;s surprising, given the company&apos;s impressive lineup of smartwatches.</p><p>As a basic health tracker, the Amazfit Helio Ring gets many of the basics right with a durable design and a fairly accurate step counter. But for this price point, you&apos;d be better off just getting an Oura Ring or even a RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring. However, it may be worth a look if you can get the ring at a discount.</p>

It's also a great option for sleep tracking, especially for anyone suffering with sleep apnea.

This is an easy way to record your phone calls, but it&apos;s so much more than that. The feature uses AI to generate transcripts of your call and a summary of what you discussed so that you can recall what you talked about later. And the best part is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">it all happens on-device</a>, meaning your private calls remain out of Google&apos;s hands.</p><p>So how do you use Call Notes? And will the person on the other end know they&apos;re being recorded? Here&apos;s how you get started on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-call-notes-to-record-and-transcribe-your-calls-2">How to use Call Notes to record and transcribe your calls</h2>
<p>1. Start a call. On your phone, tap the <strong>More</strong> button to expand the menu and tap <strong>Call Notes</strong>. An audible message will inform users on both ends that the call is being recorded.</p><p>2. When the call is over, go to the <strong>Recent</strong> tab in the phone app and tap the call you recorded (calls with AI summaries will have a small blue and purple paper icon next to them). When it is ready, a Call summary will appear in the expanded call entry. (Note: A call must be at least 30 seconds long for the feature to work.)</p><p>3. Tap <strong>View full transcript</strong> to view the Call summary and an AI-generated transcript of the call. You can also play back the call at the bottom of the screen. There are options to copy or send the Call summary or send the file for the recorded call audio.</p>

<p>Depending on the call, the AI-generated summary should include the following information:</p><p>Google notes that there may be inaccuracies or offensive language in the summary, although this is solely dependent on the nature of the call and "doesn&apos;t represent Google&apos;s views." The company also notes that by using the feature, you agree to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai">Generative AI Terms of Service</a> and recommends that users respect the privacy of others.</p><p>For now, Call Notes is only available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.
