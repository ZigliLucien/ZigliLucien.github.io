<ul><li>Samsung will likely add a new Magnet case accessory supporting Qi2 charging tech.</li><li>The long-rumored charging tech might finally be seen on Galaxy S25 series’ accessories next month.</li><li>The flagship trio is expected to be unveiled in the U.S. on January 22, 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is prepping for the Galaxy S25 series at an anticipated launch happening in a month, as rumored; however, it isn’t stopping us from wondering what to expect, and the latest report brings back some exciting information regarding the wireless charging capabilities of the upcoming Galaxy S25 models.</p><p>According to the Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">SuomiMobiili</a> report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/qi2-wireless-charging-galaxy-s25-but-only-with-magnetic-case/">Android Police</a>), Samsung will be throwing in a new accessory with the sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series, which brings support for the Qi2 standard wireless charging to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>Although it is entirely different from native Qi2 charging support built right into the handset, it still gets the job done for users who would want their phones to meet modern wireless charging standards with the help of an essential accessory.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-caseborne-case-01.jpg" alt="The Caseborne clear case with MagSafe magnets for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8h3vMdZKACqFBnA9YtG5H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Qi2 standard has been around since 2023, no major Android OEM has been able to bring it to the mainstream handsets, and the Galaxy S24 series was anticipated to incorporate the feature; however, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">made no avail</a>. Further, the compatible accessories were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">reported to be altering</a> with the S-Pen feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>With the latest information, however, things might move around as Samsung is bringing compatible Magnet cases next to traditional protective cases. It also eliminates the need to rely on third-party compatible cases, which caused some issues in the first place.</p>
<p>It also means users will be able to use Apple’s MagSafe accessories for the upcoming trio of Galaxy S25 series if the report turns out to be accurate. Other than the accessories, the report further confirms the launch date of the Unpacked event, which is most probably bound to happen on January 22, 2025 in the U.S.</p><p>Moreover, the regular Galaxy S25 is likely to carry 128GB as the base variant, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra should start with 256GB as the base variant and go all the way up to 1TB.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's next flagship phones are likely to introduce MediaTek's new 5G modem.</li><li>The yet-to-be-announced 5G modem is rumored to be in testing on the Pixel 10 prototype handsets.</li><li>Alongside the new Tensor G5 produced by TSMC instead of Samsung, this might be a new addition to the Pixel 10 lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might be silently working on the next flagship models—the Pixel 10 series. While very little is known about the devices via rumors and leaks, new information reveals the possible shift of the modem on the upcoming Pixel 10 models.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-mediatek-modem-pixel-10-3507964/">Android Authority</a>, which indicates that Google is testing the MediaTek T900 modem for the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> prototypes. While the publication cites an inside source for this new information, very little is known about the upcoming modem, which is yet to be released by the chipset maker.</p>
<p>As the publication notes, Google only has three major chipset makers to choose from for the device's modem, including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung, unless it wants to develop the modem in-house. This is similar to what the company is trying to achieve with the Tensor G5 and other succeeding SoCs going forward, which will likely be used in the upcoming Pixel devices.</p><p>It is believed that Google has even considered using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem, primarily used in the Apple iPhone 16 series; however, for reasons uncited, the search giant is likely opting for MediaTek's T900, notes Android Authority.</p><p>The upcoming T900 is expected to be based on MediaTek's M85 IP modem; for reference, the previous iteration, M80, relied on 3GPP Release 16 5G specification. This means that the presumed successor is likely to rely on the specifications of Release 17 5G.</p>
<p>All the evidence regarding the modem is still speculative at this point, and it could be way too early to jump on assumptions about the performance aspect of the modem on the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is rumored to bring at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">four Pixel 10 models</a> next year with the in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">customized Tensor G5</a>, which will be a departure from Samsung as TSMC steps in for the chipset production. The supposed models could include Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>However, the next product launch before the flagship series is believed to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">recent renders</a>/ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">real-life images</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">leaked specs</a> of it already indicate a promising handset from the search giant.</p>

<p>I don't typically use alarms because I hate being jolted out of REM sleep, as if the noise punched me awake and left me sullen and sluggish. Waking up on my own isn't usually a problem, but on days I can't risk oversleeping, I'd sure love my phone alarm to have a target wake-up range, using my smartwatch or smart ring data to hold off until I'm in my light sleep stage.</p><p>[<em>Infomercial voice</em>] But wait, now I can!</p><p>I own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> for dependable health and sleep accuracy without needing a subscription.

Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hate wearing watches to bed</a>, I tried it during my Charge 6 review and found it worked as intended, avoiding any sudden jolts awake.</p><p>But since I'm the Wearables lead, I switch brands from week to week. <em>Most</em> brands don't offer a similar feature, and Fitbit itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">won't make any more smartwatches</a>. Google, which owns Fitbit, hasn't ported Smart Wake to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, only offering basic alarm scheduling. Most watch and band owners don't have a tool like it.</p>

<p>Nearly any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> (or Apple Watch) will have detailed sleep-stage breakdowns within a few minutes of waking up. So I'd imagine some simple if/then conditionals would make this feature possible: If the time is during the requested wake-up window, check the current sleep stage; if deep or REM, wait 1 minute, then check again; if light, trigger the alarm; and if users hit the end of the wake-up window while still in REM, trigger alarm anyways so they don't oversleep.</p><p>Ultrahuman's Smart Alarm also has the option to trigger an alarm once the user clears their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/introducing-sleep-debt-manage-your-sleep-deficiency-with-the-ring-air/">sleep debt</a>, which I find very cool. My partner doesn't like setting alarms because she has occasional anxious, sleepless nights, but other nights she'll oversleep until she has an hour of <em>negative</em> sleep debt. Ultrahuman's conditional "only wake up when you're rested" alarm would be perfect for her.</p><p>So many brands today emphasize things like sleep coaching or daily energy scores. Imagine if your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> had a conditional alarm that only buzzed your wrist when you hit a high-enough Body Battery score. The same would apply to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> and its Oura Readiness score, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and its daily Energy Score, and so on.</p><p>I know some smart alarm clocks detect your stage by picking up movement, but those don't work as well for couples since either person could trigger the not-dreaming state. Apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">Sleep Cycle</a> that pick up movement noises with your phone mic may have the same problem, <em>and</em> wouldn't work as well if you use white noise apps to sleep. Basically, I'd rather use a watch's direct heart rate and movement data, and cut out the guesswork.</p><p>Since my partner and I both own Ultrahuman Ring Airs, we don't need to worry about other smartwatches or rings; we're getting this feature soon. But it's my job to care about my readers' needs, too, and I think a lot of people — and the loved ones suffering from their wrong-side-of-the-bed grumpiness — would benefit from more graceful wake-ups. Here's hoping that by the end of 2025, more brands will follow in Fitbit and Ultrahuman's footsteps with smarter alarms!</p>

That's part of my job; if a Google exec scratches his or her butt, I need to see how it affects Google's portfolio and us since we're the ones using these products.</p><p>That means I rarely worry about what other companies, like Apple, do to their users. This time is different because Apple's disdain for consumers and lack of cooperation puts us all at risk, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-and-iphone-users-told-to-pause-texting-each-other-amid-major-security-threat">according to the FBI</a>, which <em>usually</em> knows what it is doing.</p><p>I'm talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>. Of course, I'm talking about RCS because it's been at least a month since I had to talk about RCS.</p>

<p>Here's the deal: if you use an iPhone and message someone else who is using an iPhone, you're good. If you use an Android phone and message someone else using an Android phone, you're good, too. The problem is when an iPhone user messages an Android user or an Android user messages an iPhone user.</p><p>Those messages, using the default messages app built into the phone, are no more secure than the old way of sending a text was. Apple did incorporate RCS messaging into iMessage, but it did it in a way that's not secure and didn't work with Google to sort it out.</p>
<p>This happened because of RCS itself. The tech, in its current form, doesn't support any sort of encryption yet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-nowin-ios-a-new-chapter-for-mobile-messaging/">It's being worked on</a>, but if you implement RCS using only the current open standards, messages are no safer than they used to be.</p><p>On the other hand, Google <em>does</em> offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-encryption">encrypted</a> RCS messaging — but only between two Android phones or the Chrome browser tied to an Android phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">It added this itself</a> because RCS has no encryption method in place.</p><p>Since about 80% of people worldwide who use a smartphone are using an Android smartphone, this was one of those times when Google did the right thing. Apple didn't. Apple offers iPhone users who talk to other iPhone users encryption and tells everyone else to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107676/buy-your-mom-an-iphone">just buy an iPhone</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT" name="google-messages-rcs-chatting-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS chatting on a Pixel 4a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FBI piping in to let everyone know there is a problem isn't unexpected. In fact, it's the opposite, and I'm surprised it took so long. I assumed exploits would pop up during the first week, just like spam and phishing messages supposedly from the post office did. You (probably) aren't special, and nobody is actively trying to steal your identity and hack your credit cards; they're just trying to steal everyone's identity and get everyone's credit card info. Casting a huge net is an easy way to scam regular people out of millions each year.</p><p>Apple and Google could have, and should have, prevented this. Instead, Google was worried about tossing barbs at Apple and then taking a victory lap even when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">didn't really get what it was demanding</a>. Meanwhile, Apple trudged along and did nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-chinese-connection-in-apples-support-for-googles-messaging-platform/articleshow/107784364.cms#:~:text=China%20has%20been%20pushing%20device,a%20condition%20of%20regulatory%20certification." target="_blank">until China said they had to</a> add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">RCS capabilities</a>. Apple will always try to appease China when it's easy to do it, just like Google would. Neither side cared about working together to help consumers like us because we were going to buy their shit anyway. 💰🐄</p>
<p>So what should you do? If you live outside the U.S. or Canada, you probably don't have to do anything because you likely don't even use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> or iMessage. People here use them because texts are free, and, well, we just <em>do</em>.</p><p>If you use either, you should stop and switch to a secure and encrypted platform like the FBI says. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">There are plenty,</a> but I'm partial to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eu-makes-switch-signal-its-messaging-app-choice">Signal</a> because the people behind it only care about making a secure messaging service; they want to hook you on their product by making it great and not tying it to another service or looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-now-requires-you-share-data-facebook">sell it off to Meta</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:644px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.72%;"><img id="o2JmVcGfDhuGhdDYEdt8tN" name="signal" alt="Signal messenger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2JmVcGfDhuGhdDYEdt8tN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="644" height="288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://signal.org/install" target="_blank">Signal</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's easier said than done. You could go through all of your contacts and ask them to switch to another platform, but they're not going to do it. They don't think they need to do it because they might not have thousands in the bank sitting around ripe for the taking, or they don't think they have anything to hide.</p><p>All you really can do is refuse to send any information through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> or iMessage that you don't want the world to read and wish the companies that made these things actually cared about their users.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>It's been long teased that Google was working on an XR platform based on Android, with hardware coming from Samsung in partnership with Qualcomm. Now the cat's out of the bag with the announcement of Android XR, a new platform that's set to power smart glasses and XR headsets not unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>According to Google, the platform will launch first on headsets, with Samsung's Project Moohan set to release in 2025. This will enable users to "switch between being fully immersed in a virtual environment and staying present in the real world," not unlike how some of the best VR headsets work. Smartphone and tablet apps will also work, and Google is optimizing its own apps for the platform.</p><p>Google is also testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, as we saw with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>. This will use Gemini to provide information about what you're looking at, and it's suggested that visual cues may also be available.</p><p>There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">a lot of potential with Android XR</a>, which makes it one of the most exciting things to look forward to in 2025.</p>

Gemini 2.0 is taking things to the next level by making it more capable than before, allowing it to better understand the world around you and complete tasks on behalf of the user.</p><p>What does this mean, exactly? This means that Gemini 2.0 is equipped to power experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra</a>, which was shown on Google I/O earlier this year. It can visualize the world around you and even remember what it saw so you can recall something later. And with Project Mariner, Gemini 2.0 can complete complex, multi-step tasks for you by understanding what's on your screen, just as a virtual assistant should. We've seen companies like Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">show off concepts</a> similar to this, so it'll be interesting to see how this evolves in 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Qi2 has been out for a little while, but it's been mostly absent on Android, save for some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD phones</a>. However, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, this could change, as the latest rumors suggest the company might finally adopt the wireless charging spec in its upcoming devices.</p><p>If true, then the Galaxy S25 series will support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a> available for iPhones, allowing them to charge wirelessly at the full 15W instead of being subjected to slower speeds.</p><p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">a separate rumor</a> suggests that the phones may not have Qi2 integrated into the phones themselves. Instead, the newer standard may only be accessible via compatible cases. This would be similar to what we've seen with recent OPPO phones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>If true, it's unclear why companies are opting for this method, but given that many users will likely purchase cases for their phones, it may not be a huge deal. Still, it would be nice to have it integrated for those who may not want a case, but we'll have to wait and see what we get when the Galaxy S25 launches in early 2025.</p>

The company announced this week that new users will immediately see the base price of $82.99, a $10 increase from the previous $72.99 that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-2023-price-increase">introduced in early 2023</a>.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9285852">explained</a> that the updated price is due to the rising costs of content but that users can expect to retain their current features and benefits.</p><p>For new users, the price won't update until January 13, 2025, so there's some buffer time in case you want to consider your options or pause your membership. Otherwise, prepare to pay more in the coming month as streaming services continue to reach cable prices.</p>

It will be paired with the Titan M2 security processor, and the configurations of the mid-range handset may include 8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage</p><p>The device is believed to ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box as opposed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and, like the flagship series, Google may offer seven years of OS upgrades and security updates.</p><p>The expected dimensions from the leaked spec sheet show that the Pixel 9a will measure 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, making it slightly taller and wider than the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. The device might also be slightly lighter, around 185.9 grams.</p>
<p>The display, with a 120Hz refresh rate, would measure around 6.3 inches and is an AMOLED screen with Full HD+ resolution and a peak brightness of up to 2700 nits. It is believed to feature Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top. The dual cameras at the back will have a 48MP primary lens accompanying a 13MP ultra-wide lens. For selfies, the handset is likely to rely on a 13MP shooter.</p><p>A slightly bigger battery capacity will keep the lights on the Pixel 9a. It will host a 5100mAh battery with support for 23W charging alongside 7.5W wireless charging support. Lastly, the device may also feature an IP68 rating similar to the Pixel 9 series.</p>
<p>The handset is expected to cost $499 (the MSRP in the leaked sheet) and may be available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony, the latter two being the newest color additions. The spec sheet also confirms the model numbers and device availability in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and India markets.</p><p>In addition to the leaked specifications, we have also seen what the Pixel 9a would look like — thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">recent real-life</a> images, which are believed to be prototypes. This isn't the first time we have seen it, as a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">real-life image</a> was spotted indicating that the iconic Pixel camera visor design at the back has been removed, and the Pixel 9a will stick to a flat, flushed camera design.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful flagship phone at a midrange price; great cameras and stylish design are important to you; you need over two days of battery life on a single charge.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re interested in the latest AI features or long software support; you need IP68 ingress protection in your devices. </p><p>The OnePlus 12 topped our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> this year thanks to a sophisticated blend of thoughtful design choices, outstanding battery life, and Snapdragon-powered performance that could easily rival the best devices from Samsung or Google. </p><p>As senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda points out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">his 4.5/5-star review</a>, the phone really feels like a culmination of everything that OnePlus has learned over its past ten years of releases. The OnePlus 12 is a refinement more than a reinvention, and in this case, that&apos;s a very good thing.</p><p>Of course, everything isn&apos;t perfect with the flagship. You only get five years of guaranteed OS/security updates (compared to Samsung and Google&apos;s seven-year promise), and you won&apos;t enjoy any of the fancy AI features that have been dominating the airwaves lately. But if you simply want an incredible flagship experience with a record-smashing discount, then this OnePlus 12 deal is for you.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung is preparing to introduce new extra Galaxy Ring sizes, 14 and 15, next year in January.</li><li>There is speculation that these larger sizes could feature "slightly" large batteries, but that remains to be seen.</li><li>A Galaxy Ring 2 patent suggests it could deliver a flexible internal structure and other rumors purport a longer battery life and a thinner profile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy Ring finds itself wrapped in a new rumor that claims there could be more of it on the way.</p><p>The rumors surfaced on X through a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1867578381803327678">Max Jambor</a> who claims Samsung is planning to introduce new ring size options (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-two-more-size-options-january/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the tipster discovered internal model numbers for these extra sizes: SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. Jambor claims that these model names are for Galaxy Ring sizes 14 and 15, respectively.</p><p>Both sizes weigh roughly 3.2 grams and with a diameter of ~23mm and ~23.8mm.</p><p>More importantly, Jambor states an announcement of these Galaxy Ring sizes could occur sometime in January alongside its market availability.</p><p>What's more, the publication speculates that these two extra Galaxy Rings could provide even larger batteries. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> is available in U.S. sizes ranging from five to 13. This affects its battery as the smallest size sees an 18mAh battery capacity while the 13 variant features a 23.5mAh capacity. Jambor didn't allude to any such changes; however, there could be a chance that the size 14 and 15 rings grab a <em>slightly </em>larger battery.</p>

<p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-more-sizes-rumor">isn't the first time</a> Jambor has alleged an expansion in Samsung's Galaxy Ring size selection. In September, a post claimed that the Korean OEM was creating additional sizes — 14 and 15 — but that they would debut in "the coming weeks." It seems things have changed as nothing launched in October nor in November and with us in December, it seems Samsung set its sights on the new year.</p><p>Curiously, this extra Galaxy Ring selection <em>could </em>line up with the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked, rumored for January. Next month is expected to host the unveiling of the Galaxy S25 series. Perhaps, if the Galaxy Ring does make a quick appearance, it will be to announce the availability of these additional sizes.</p><p>The O.G. smart ring has been relatively quiet as all eyes have been on its next iteration, the Galaxy Ring 2, as rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">suggest a resizing function</a>. A patent discovered in October claims the next Galaxy Ring could offer a "resizing structure" via its flexible internals that will only require Samsung to create one (outer) ring. The band would expand depending on the size of the user's finger for a comfortable fit.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">rumors claim</a> the Galaxy Ring 2 could receive an increased battery life and a thinner profile.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of Gemini in Drive, which aims to help summarize a user's folders, documents, spreadsheets, and more.</li><li>Users can write their query for a folder in Drive's side panel or they can navigate to a folder and hit the "summarize folder" button.</li><li>Google recently updated Docs with additional Gemini help for crafting formatted documents while also unveiling Gemini 2.0.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for Drive users that brings Gemini into its side panel with new tools.</p><p>The company highlighted the latest update in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/adding-folder-support-to-gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-drive.html">Workspace post</a>, stating Gemini can now summarize documents in Drive. Google explains that Gemini in Drive can only answer questions about your "text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations."</p><p>More specifically, with Gemini entering Drive's side panel, Google states users can write their queries about a folder before the "@" symbol and the name of the folder; i.e., "summarize the files in @AndroidCentral."</p><p>Additionally, Google gives the example of asking about the "theme of the content" within a folder.</p><p>Writing your prompt to Gemini isn't the only avenue toward quick information as users will find a starry icon button in folders, too. Once you receive this update, navigating to a folder <em>should </em>display a "Summarize this folder" button beneath the navigation bar. Clicking this will automatically inform Gemini of your request and produce the side panel with its generated information.</p><p>There will also be a "suggestions" option alongside the likely ability for users to expand on what they'd like Gemini to surface via the text field.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.42%;"><img id="z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ" name="google-drive-gemini-side-panel-folder-summaries" alt="Google Drive is receiving a Gemini update that lets it summarize the contents of folder, documents, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="993" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, users can right-click on a document in their list and click "Ask Gemini" for information that way. The side panel expands its uses by letting users drag and drop documents into it instead of the "@" mention method.</p><p>The update started rolling out on December 11 for users under rapid and scheduled release domains. Workspace customers with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and Google One AI Premium add-ons will have access to Gemini in Drive's side panel for summarization.</p><p>Moreover, the company states users need to have "smart features and personalization" enabled before this feature is usable. Admins can turn this on by default for users if need be.</p><p>Gemini's capabilities across Workspace have consistently grown, especially through its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">recent update for Docs</a>. The AI utilizes a prompt — "help me create" — which is reminiscent of its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">smart home test</a> for Google Home. Regardless, the Google Doc version lets the AI help users create formatted documents from scratch. The AI can also easily grab files from your Drive and incorporate them into a new file for you.</p><p>Elsewhere, Gmail picked up extra Gemini help via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-gmail-contextual-smart-replies-workspace">contextual smart replies</a>." The update to its AI-generated replies will take into account what's been said in your current line of messages <em>before </em>offering a quick suggestion. Additionally, Google unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> this week, which prepares to usher in a new "agentic era."</p>
