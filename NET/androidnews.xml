                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung’s Galaxy Watches are wonderfully robust wrist wearables packed with a plethora of features like their top-tier Galaxy smartphone counterparts. You can do everything from basic step counting to tracking your sleep, monitoring your heart for irregular heartbeats, and measuring and analyzing your body fat — a feat rarely found in a smartwatch. </p><p>One of my favorite uses of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> is to track my workouts and outdoor adventures without needing to take my phone along, which also means connecting my favorite pair of Bluetooth earbuds directly to my watch. So, let&apos;s go ahead and answer the question:  how <em>do</em> you pair Bluetooth headphones with a Galaxy Watch?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-pair-bluetooth-headphones-with-a-galaxy-watch-2">How to pair Bluetooth headphones with a Galaxy Watch</h2>
<p>1. Put your earbuds in pairing mode. This will vary depending on the model that you are using. </p><p>2. From your Galaxy Watch, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the top of the watch face to reveal the <strong>Quick Panel</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Settings</strong> (cog) icon.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Connections</strong>. </p><p>5. Select <strong>Bluetooth</strong>. </p>

<p>Wait a beat, and before you know it you’ll see that your earbuds are connected to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a> and ready for you to tackle whatever’s next!</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-pairing-your-headphones-to-your-watch-2">The benefits of pairing your headphones to your watch</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re going to the gym, or maybe it’s a hike, but you can leave the phone at home (or in the car, hidden) and use that 16GB of onboard storage to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-save-music-files-galaxy-watch">transfer music files to your Galaxy Watch</a> and jam out to Beyonce’s new Cowboy Carter album while you get your sweat on!</p><p>You did do that ahead of time, didn’t you? If you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">subscribe to Spotify</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, you can also use those services to get some motivational tunes, or podcasts onto the watch for those workouts as well. It&apos;s all good now that you know how to pair <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> with a Galaxy Watch!</p><p>With the LTE version of the watch, you don’t even have to worry about downloading content directly to it, you can stream on the go to your heart’s content. Provided you have a strong enough signal and an app that supports standalone streaming from your Galaxy Watch. Personally, I’d rather have the music downloaded. Ain’t nobody got time for buffering in the wilderness!</p><p>I used one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> on the market, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4</a>, but these directions work with any Bluetooth wireless earbuds or headphones. If you really want to get the most out of that Bluetooth connection, pair your Galaxy Watch to Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, and you’ll be able to use the Buds app on the watch to control features like adaptive noise canceling right from the watch.</p>

I was addicted, and the only cure was one more round. C-Smash VRS is the epitome of an arcade classic, redesigned and reformulated for at-home VR systems after decades of relegation to now-defunct arcades.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div>
<p>It&apos;s a Sega classic from the instant you start it up, with music by Rez veterans and addictive, high-score-based gameplay to match. But this isn&apos;t the only time I&apos;ve found myself practically addicted to a VR game where I smash a ball with some kind of racket.</p><p>Before C-Smash, it was Racket Club, a social Squash/Pickleball hybrid with a community that&apos;s as friendly as it is competitive and immediately landed on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/12">best Meta Quest games</a> when it debuted last Fall. Beyond these two titles, there&apos;s a notable enthusiast community that loves playing other racket games like Eleven Table Tennis, Pickleball One, Cybrix, Racket Fury, and several others.</p><p>Like Wii Sports, games that revolve around existing sports tend to be the most accessible experiences because you don&apos;t have to re-teach gamers what to do. People already know how to hit a ball with a tennis racket or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">a golf club</a>, and like the Wii, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> enhance the experience and make it feel even more real.</p>

<p>C-Smash VRS originally launched as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> exclusive game last Spring. It&apos;s a complete reimagining of the classic Dreamcast game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfnCyHqbc4Y">Cosmic Smash</a>, which puts players on one side of a Squash-sized court while blocks are placed on the other side.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever played the classic Atari game Breakout — or one of its many clones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=breakout.brick.breaker.classic">on the Google Play store</a> — you&apos;ll immediately understand the concept. It&apos;s your job to lob the ball across the court and take out the targets as fast as possible. C-Smash is a classic arcade game through and through, awarding high scores and worldwide leaderboard placement for the best players.</p><p>The single-player campaign sees you making your way through the stars with its quirky Space Channel 5-esque sci-fi theme that feels a bit like it came out of the 1960s. Before the rounds begin, you&apos;ll choose your pathway through a randomized solar system that&apos;s filled with power-up planets, each of which will present a different challenge to clear out bricks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the soundtrack is superb, ushering in a wave of catchy tunes and funky beats by the ever-amazing DJ Ken Ishii. If you don&apos;t immediately recognize the name, know that he was behind the soundtracks for Sega classics like Lumines and Rez. The game feels Sega through and through, and for a guy who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I&apos;m all here for it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As a kid who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I'm all here for C-Smash's incredible soundtrack and arcade gameplay.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each planet features a different court theme and power-ups like multiball will no doubt excite pinball fans as they watch dozens of balls explode from those special bricks and clear out the entire court in seconds. I managed to get a top-5 high score worldwide in one of these multiball rounds before C-Smash VRS went public on Quest last Friday, although I doubt I&apos;m still on the leaderboard at this point.</p><p>Because each court is wider than you&apos;ll likely be able to move in your home space, you&apos;ll use the left controller stick to slide your character left and right to help yourself reach even the widest shots from the backplane.</p><p>I played the game on the PSVR 2 when it came out but decided I wasn&apos;t a fan of games that make you move around as much, given that the PSVR 2 has a cable I tend to trip over. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is completely wireless, I never once felt like I was being pulled out of the experience just to remember not to trip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But C-Smash isn&apos;t just a single-player experience, and for me, that&apos;s where the real longevity comes into play. C-Smash VRS features several different multiplayer modes that put players on courts that face each other, tasking them with clearing or claiming all the bricks before the other player.</p><p>The mode&apos;s one weakness is that there&apos;s no cross-play at the moment, but the team confirmed that it&apos;s something they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/1bg5b9o/comment/kv6d814">looking at implementing</a> in the future. In fact, that very Reddit thread outlines a new C-Smash Saturday meetup program the team at RapidEyeMovers holds every Saturday at 1pm PT / 4pm ET / 8pm GMT. It&apos;s perfect if you&apos;re looking for a little mid-day breakup of a lazy Saturday and it&apos;s sure to get your heart pumping.</p>
<h2 id="the-wii-sports-effect-2">The Wii Sports effect</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.82%;"><img id="qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6" name="wii-sports-tennis.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Wii Sports tennis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1847" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that Wii Sports sold more Wii consoles than any other game. The game was a free pack-in with every Wii sold in the West, proving the importance of including an accessible, killer app with every system.</p><p>Everyone loved Wii Sports. Gamers, non-gamers, young people, old people, etc. It was a game that brought people together for some fun physical activity in the living room and was instantly playable no matter your skill level. The game felt like pure magic and its influence can be spotted in many VR games to date.</p><p>In the same way, many VR sports games can offer extremely accessible gameplay by keeping things simple. C-Smash VRS is slightly more complicated than something like Wii Sports because it&apos;s more "video gamey," but that&apos;s why there are games like Racket Club.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHwNrFR2Fiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>When you start up Racket Club, you&apos;re not greeted with a complicated menu system or a lot of nonsense hoops to run through. You can immediately head out the door and be placed into a public lobby filled with players ready to show you the ropes. The game instantly makes sense and it only takes a few seconds to understand the nuances that make it different from other racket games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Racket Club's friendly community is as good as the game itself.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just like C-Smash, you&apos;ll be hitting a ball with a racket and bouncing it off a wall, but unlike C-Smash, your opponents will hit the ball right back at you. Each court is only as big as the play space you&apos;re standing in which means you won&apos;t need to virtually move your character around with a joystick.</p><p>The latest update lets you customize and adjust the racket itself, too, helping players of all kinds feel comfortable holding the virtual racket the way they want to. I always take some time to adjust to each racket game&apos;s holding angle, so this was a particularly refreshing update for me.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZu-TcE4JDQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Racket Club&apos;s endearing fan base ensures you&apos;ll always have a good time. Players have always been super friendly and talkative, willing to play a few practice rounds to warm you up, and even gracious when they lose.</p><p>Unironically, it comes from the same developers that put together Demeo, a game that boasts one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">friendliest online communities</a> I&apos;ve ever experienced. The internet is filled to the brim with jerks and trolls, but I have yet to have a bad experience with either of these titles from Resolution Games.</p><p>But while Wii Sports&apos; gameplay largely plateaus after a short time, Racket Club&apos;s simple-to-learn mechanics are more rewarding the more time you put into the game. The game has a true experience curve that feels realistic in both single-player and multiplayer modes, thanks to the company&apos;s unique use of deep learning AI for its computer-controlled players.</p><p>That means no matter if you want to play through the game&apos;s deep single-player campaign mode or head straight online and play against real human players, you&apos;re bound to have a rewarding experience. Couple that with the safety that mixed-reality gameplay delivers — you can play far better when you&apos;re not worried about smashing your TV — and it&apos;s clear that Racket Club is the Wii Sports Tennis successor we&apos;ve been looking for.</p>

<ul><li>Roku's latest TV lineup, the Roku Pro Series, features a Mini-LED backlit panel, 120Hz refresh rate, and 4K display with enhanced image processing.</li><li>Available in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch sizes, the Roku Pro Series is now accessible through major retailers like BestBuy, Amazon, and Walmart.</li><li>The package includes a remote control with backlit buttons and AI picture improvements.</li><li>The Roku Pro Series introduces a remote finder feature, a first for Roku TVs, that allows users to locate their remote easily.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Roku has finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2024/04/roku-pro-series-arrives-with-elevated-features-and-design-in/jsabjq4m-1712687696" target="_blank">released</a> its newest TV lineup, the Roku Pro Series. The company says the new model offers the line&apos;s best picture quality yet and can seamlessly fit into any home setup.</p><p>Unveiled at CES in January, these new smart TVs boast a Mini-LED backlit panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and beefed-up image processing. They also have a 4K panel in a slim 1.9-inch shadowbox frame. The Mini-LED backlighting amps up the contrast and highlights, while HDR10+ and Dolby Vision IQ ensure top-notch HDR support.</p><p>This fresh set is now available in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch sizes and is hitting store shelves at major retailers like BestBuy, Amazon, and Walmart. The 55-inch model costs $899, the 65-inch model $1,199, and the 75-inch version $1,699.</p><p>The package includes what seems like a major upgrade: a remote control with backlit buttons (you can snag it separately for other TVs for $29) and AI picture improvements.</p><p>Like some leading TV brands, the Roku Pro Series is expected to deliver a brighter image and improved contrast than Roku&apos;s more budget-friendly Plus Series and Select Series.</p>
<h2 id="ai-powered-picture-adjustments-2">AI-powered picture adjustments</h2>
<p>These TVs are designed to do all the heavy lifting for you, automatically fine-tuning and optimizing their picture and brightness according to the scene and content being shown. Roku dubs this feature "Smart Picture Max."</p><p>There&apos;s a slightly less sophisticated version, called Roku Smart Picture, which is slated to roll out to all Roku TVs in a future OS update.</p><p>The Roku Pro Series ships with a nifty remote finder feature too. Just hit a button on the TV, and your remote will start making noise wherever it&apos;s hiding. While this same handy feature is already available on certain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-roku">Roku streaming devices</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-roku-voice-remote-pro-work-my-roku-device">Roku Voice Remote Pro</a>, it&apos;s a first for Roku TVs to include a dedicated finder button.</p>
<h2 id="watch-out-samsung-2">Watch out Samsung</h2>
<p>Another standout feature worth mentioning is Backdrops, which serves as a decorative background when your TV isn&apos;t in use, much like Samsung&apos;s The Frame. With Backdrops, you can pick from a range of artwork or even upload your own family photos to personalize your space. This feature will soon roll out to other Roku TVs and streaming devices in the coming months.</p><p>On the audio front, there&apos;s more intelligence at play as well. The Roku Soundstage Audio makes the most out of its side-firing speakers, which also boast Dolby Atmos support.</p><p>With all these features, the Roku Pro Series seems ready to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">leading Android TV models</a> from Hisense and TCL. It&apos;ll be interesting to see how the Roku Pro Series compares to other eagerly awaited smart TVs set to hit the market this year in terms of price and performance.</p>

<ul><li>A listing for an unreleased "Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device" has appeared in the Bluetooth SIG database.</li><li>It appears to hint at an upcoming streaming device from Walmart that will serve as a more premium Google TV competitor. </li><li>Currently, Walmart sells two Google TV streaming sticks: the Onn Google TV Full HD Streaming Device and the Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Walmart&apos;s budget electronics brand Onn released two Google TV streaming devices last year, and a third might be on the way. You can choose from either the Onn <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-google-tv-full-hd-streaming-device">Google TV Full HD Streaming Device</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/wlmart-onn-google-tv-4k-streaming-box">Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box</a> today, which retail for $15 and $20, respectively. However, if a new listing in the Bluetooth SIG database is any indication, a more premium option might be on the way, offering "Pro" features while staying in the budget category. </p><p>Walmart, officially named Wal-Mart Stores Inc., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/204456" target="_blank">declared</a> a new product in the Bluetooth SIG database on Tuesday, April 9 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/walmart-4k-pro-google-tv-streaming-device-bluetooth-sig/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). The unreleased device is called the "Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device Google TV" and uses the Bluetooth 5.2 spec, hence its inclusion in the Bluetooth SIG database. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is the body that approves and licenses products that use the Bluetooth protocol and brands and hosts a database of licensed products.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear how Walmart will differentiate the 4K Pro Streaming Device from the existing 4K Streaming Box. The latter device checks several boxes for just $20, including 4K streaming and AV1 decoding support. However, the 4K Streaming Box uses a measly Quad-core Cortex-A35 processor with 2GB of memory and 8GB of storage. An easy way for Walmart to bolster its 4K Pro Streaming Device would be to add more RAM and on-device storage.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.61%;"><img id="87ATRMzozdc8aqJvrT2HwM" name="Onn-4K-Pro-Bluetooth-SIG.png" alt="A listing in the Bluetooth SIG database." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87ATRMzozdc8aqJvrT2HwM.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2480" height="908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other areas that Walmart could improve on are the streaming box&apos;s build quality and port offerings. It&apos;s likely that the company will still target the budget market and try to keep the 4K Pro Streaming Device as cheap as possible, though. The two things we know for sure are that the 4K Pro Streaming Device will include a remote and run Google TV, as stated by the Bluetooth SIG product description. </p><p>Products typically appear in regulatory or corporate databases, like Bluetooth SIG, when they are nearing an official launch. However, we still don&apos;t know when the Onn 4K Pro Streaming Device might debut or how much it will cost. </p>

<p>For users who don’t often want to fiddle with the display settings for the best picture quality while watching different types of content, new automatic optimizations will be in place, like adjustments to brightness and colors applying the best picture mode, which includes sports, movies, vivid, and standard for the content users are watching. Moreover, this feature will also adjust the backlighting, uniformity, and colors based on the type of TV users are using. </p><p>The browsing content experience is likely to improve on Roku TV as the company is adding an IMDB rating for the content available on the platform. Accompanying trailers will also be added in the entails pane. For users who often use the Save List for a TV show or a movie, a new badge will be available whenever a new season drops or episode drops.</p>

<p>The Roku mobile app is also getting useful updates, like a new navigation bar allowing users to browse between five tabs: Home, Search, Remote, Devices, and Account. There is a new “Top Searched TV and Movies” row to browse popular content, showcasing daily searched TV shows and movies. The search update will now have a full keyboard for users to search content across categories, actors, and other topics. The search results are believed to be more visually immersive than before.</p><p>Lastly, the popular Roku City screensaver is gaining new TV and movie cars for users to play around with.

Roku Smart Picture is going to ship for all Roku TV models. It will be the default for the latest Roku models of this year, whereas the older Roku owners will have to enable it after the update in picture settings. Roku also notes that the OS 13 will roll out to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.roku.com/article/228844467#:~:text=Supported%20Roku%20devices%20receiving%20Roku%20OS%2013%3A">supported devices</a> in the U.S. in the coming months.</p>

In the past, that used to be limited to OnePlus or Google; OxygenOS delivered everything I wanted in an Android interface, and even though the cameras weren&apos;t the best, the fluidity of the software and the customizability meant I inevitably went back to a OnePlus phone.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>Similarly, Pixels had their shortcomings — mostly around the hardware — but Google&apos;s unique software features combined with outstanding cameras made using a Pixel a delight. In recent years, I found myself using Samsung phones more and more; I called the Galaxy S23 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-my-favorite-android-phone-2023">one of my favorite phones</a> last year, and I used that device for over three months at a stretch.</p><p>So when I got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, I thought it would be just as exciting to use as its predecessor — but I was wrong. The phone turned out to be too much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>; even though it has a titanium chassis, it is the same weight, and that immediately took the sheen off the device. By contrast, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> is 19g lighter than its predecessor, and the difference is instantly noticeable — it is significantly easier to hold and use, and I thought Samsung would have similar gains on offer. </p><p>In fact, I didn&apos;t notice any major differences between the Galaxy S24 Ultra and its predecessor in daily use. I tested enough phones to know that we&apos;re past the point where we get generational gains year-on-year, but even by the usual iterative update cycle, the Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn&apos;t push the needle in a meaningful way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-7.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than a brighter AMOLED panel and updated internal hardware, Samsung didn&apos;t make any tangible changes. The cameras are the same as last year, but to its credit, Samsung tweaked the algorithms to deliver better shots, and this is clearly evident in low-light situations and when using the telephoto lenses.</p><p>But even then, the Galaxy S24 Ultra isn&apos;t the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phone</a> you can buy today — far from it. In fact, going from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Honor&apos;s Magic 6 Pro</a> to the Galaxy S24 Ultra felt like a downgrade. This year&apos;s flagships have raised the bar significantly, with Chinese brands in particular delivering stellar cameras across the board.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Honor Magic 6 Pro, OPPO Find X7 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> all have better camera packages than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and they deliver versatile lenses that take magnificent photos and videos in just about any situation. Samsung, meanwhile, positioned AI as the key differentiator with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and as someone who is ambivalent about generative AI, I just didn&apos;t care about all the new additions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CzM4oZ5wAodXHwiRJqKzv5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-5.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CzM4oZ5wAodXHwiRJqKzv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted Samsung to roll out exciting upgrades over the Galaxy S23 Ultra, but the brand instead chose to play it safe and delivered a phone that doesn&apos;t stand out in any meaningful way. It&apos;s no wonder, then, that I decided to switch to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra as soon as it showed up.</p><p>While other brands push the boundaries of camera tech every year, Samsung coasts along and stays relevant because of its unique market positioning. Samsung is the biggest Android manufacturer by a considerable margin, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is the only flagship choice in North America other than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s biggest Chinese rivals don&apos;t have a foothold in the U.S., so the brand doesn&apos;t need to worry about its dominance in the region. That situation isn&apos;t likely to change anytime soon, and therefore, Samsung really doesn&apos;t have to innovate or deliver more than the bare minimum of upgrades.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra isn&apos;t a bad phone by any measure; it just doesn&apos;t offer any material upgrades over its predecessor, and that ultimately makes it boring. As someone who uses over 75 phones a year, I get to be incredibly picky about the devices I choose as my daily driver. And in 2024, the Galaxy S24 Ultra just doesn&apos;t measure up. It is a great choice if you&apos;re on an older device and want to upgrade — it isn&apos;t the phone for me.</p>

Google says the LLM is designed to handle "highly complex tasks," and that it understands context to deliver useful recommendations and insights.</p><p>OPPO says that the integration of Gemini Ultra 1.0 will "completely change the way users interact" with their devices. While the LLM is coming to OPPO and OnePlus phones later in the year, there&apos;s no mention of what phones will get the chatbot — that information will be shared later on.</p><p>Nicole Zhang, General Manager of AI Product for OPPO and OnePlus, talked about the four key pillars that will drive the use of AI on phones: "it must utilize resources effectively, possess self-learning capabilities, perceive the real world, and bring creativity to its users."</p><p>Outside of that, there isn&apos;t much information available at the moment. OPPO uses its custom AndesGPT to deliver features like AI Eraser on its phones, and this is similar to what Google offers with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Eraser on the Pixels</a>. Clearly, the manufacturer is looking to bolster its on-device AI suite, and with Honor going all-in on AI with the likes of Magic Portal, it is likely we will see more Chinese manufacturers introduce similar features down the line. Interestingly, all of these features will be coming to OnePlus phones as well.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a redesign of the Sleep tracking views in the Fitbit app for iOS and Android. </li><li>A new page shows an at-a-glance breakdown of last night's sleep, your sleep score, and sleep timeline in the same place.</li><li>Users can also manually scrub the sleep timeline and view insights from their sleep habits as part of the overhauled experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sleep views in the Fitbit app are changing starting Wednesday, April 10, as Google rolls out a Material You redesign. The company already started bringing the Fitbit app&apos;s design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-redesign-arrives">more in line with other Google apps last year</a>, but not every feature or page saw a visual overhaul. Sleep tracking data was one such example, since pages related to it looked identical to the older Fitbit app design.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Redesigned-Sleep-experience-now-in-the-Fitbit-app/ba-p/5576113" target="_blank">Fitbit community post</a>, the fresh Sleep views and new features are finally starting to roll out now.</p><p>The older design, which featured bright purple colors and stats spread across multiple pages, is giving way to a much simpler one. One page aims to provide you with all the information you need about last night&apos;s sleep. That includes an at-a-glance view that displays your sleep duration, sleep score, and timeline. The sleep timeline is interactive, using different colors to reflect time spent in light, deep, and REM sleep stages — as well as time spent awake. </p><p>While the new look still features Fitbit&apos;s classic purple and teal accent colors, they are much more muted now. The background is now grey rather than pure white, and the page looks more cohesive than sectioned off. Generally, it visually matches the rest of the Fitbit app and other Google apps featuring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You design language</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ" name="Fitbit-Sleep-Redesign-2.jpg" alt="A Fitbit app image edited with a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sleep timeline has a scrubbing tool that can be used to uncover insights about specific moments during your sleep. The data can be narrowed down to minutes using this tool, and it could give you answers to questions like whether you woke up in the middle night or were in a deep sleep. </p><p>On a larger scale, you can pull sleep-tracking data from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit devices</a> over week, month, and year thresholds to get a view of your sleep habits over time. This will show how consistently a user is meeting the sleep targets set in the Fitbit app. It can also inform users how their sleep score and other metrics fluctuate over a longer sample size. </p><p>Though the redesign was announced on Wednesday, it has not yet been rolled out widely. It&apos;ll reach all iOS and Android users soon enough. "If you don&apos;t have it right away, please be patient as it can take some time to reach all users," a Fitbit Moderator said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Well/Redesigned-Sleep-experience-now-in-the-Fitbit-app/m-p/5576488/thread-id/13163" target="_blank">community post</a>.</p>

Smaller wearable tech has gained momentum due to its compact size and ease of use, with smart rings leading that charge. Usually in the size of traditional rings, these gadgets, designed to track sleep and fitness, are rapidly gaining popularity.</p><p>With a plethora of wearables in the market, can passive smart rings compete with more active devices like smartwatches and fitness bands? Or is this just a passing trend that will eventually lead nowhere? According to analysts, smart rings have their place in the wearable market but may not be the smartwatch replacement many are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-smart-ring-2">Rise of the smart ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-sensors.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air sitting atop a rock, showing the visible sensors on the inner ring." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you think of a smart ring, the first name that pops into your mind is Oura. This brand has not only carved out a niche in the smart ring market but also established itself as one of the leading players in this industry, selling over a million of these tiny wearables in over 98 countries. Users can track key indicators like heart rate, sleep stages, stress, and more to get a snapshot of their daily health and readiness. </p><p>After launching two rings in 2016 and 2018, Oura began to gain traction in 2021 with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> due to its improved tracking capabilities for metrics like temperature and blood oxygen sensing, features that were still up-and-coming on regular smartwatches. Oura also made strategic partnerships with entities such as the NBA, bringing the brand and its product to the limelight over other health-tracking devices and companies already diving into the smart ring market. However, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was the real catalyst for the ring’s popularity.</p><p>“That said, some of these practices were already in motion before the pandemic, and Oura was the last remaining brand amongst rings since Motiv got acquired,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s Worldwide Device Trackers, said in an interview. Motive was one such company that dove into health-tracking smart rings until it decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/motiv-shifts-its-smart-rings-health-tracking-biometrics-following-acquisition">shift its focus to biometrics</a>, offering a different approach to the wearables with a different set of features.</p><p>However, Oura isn’t the only company that wants to explore how this small fitness tracker could replace bulky smartwatches someday. Samsung showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona earlier this year and is gearing up to launch the device later this year. Other brands, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ultrahuman-home-tells-you-why-youre-not-sleeping-well">Ultrahuman</a>, Evie, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-launch-ces-2024">Amazfit</a>, have all launched versions of smart rings, trying to cram multiple features into the device and blurring the lines between smartwatches and rings.</p>
<h2 id="the-smart-ring-apos-s-biggest-rival-2">The smart ring&apos;s biggest rival</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) next to the Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3752" height="2111" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to comprehensive abilities, smartwatches can make calls, help you browse through notifications, look at photos, and even let you respond to texts, in addition to being a fitness tracker. However, that’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-smart-rings-work">not the case for smart rings</a>; despite having several health-tracking capabilities, they still fall short in some areas. Hanish Bhatia, associate director of Devices & Ecosystem at Counterpoint Research, feels that “smart rings are likely to coexist with smartwatches and not replace them.”</p><p>Ubrani agrees, noting that smart rings have become a convenient alternative, but cautions that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-has-huge-potential-but-also-huge-roadblocks">they’re not for everyone</a>. He warns that “the ring form factor certainly offers many benefits over a watch, but it’s not a home run as it often increases complexity when it comes to inventory management, finding the perfect fit for users, or tracking fitness goals in detail. As such, it won’t be a smartwatch replacement for everyone.” </p><p>Fitness enthusiasts feel these rings track certain metrics more accurately than a smartwatch due to the fit. While wearing the Ultrahuman Ring, Michael Hicks, Android Central’s wearables editor, expressed how it’s much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">easier to wear a ring to sleep</a> when compared to something that weighs more than 30g.</p><p>In a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/17yo3zh/should_i_get_an_oura_ring_to_replace_my_smartwatch/">thread</a>, a user explains how they choose between wearables based on the activity that needs tracking, noting that they don’t rely on Oura for fitness tracking but for its sleep monitoring. “I use my Apple Watch and Oura watch together. Like most people…Apple Watch for fitness and oura ring for sleep.”</p><p>Another says they chose the ring “because it’s a small device I can wear throughout the day and night without being bothered by its presence on my hands.”</p><p>Bhatia notes that while some of the smartwatch and smart ring features overlap, it might be detrimental to compare a smaller-sized wearable to that of a smartwatch. “I think they’re different products, especially when considering convenience and utility.”</p>
<h2 id="beyond-fitness-and-sleep-tracking-2">Beyond fitness and sleep tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-black-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings hold great potential beyond basic fitness tracking because they fit several sensors into a small gadget and can give users a more holistic view of their overall fitness.</p><p>Oura is looking at advancing health-tracking sensors that translate day-to-day into actionable data and insights, “It’s about listening to your body’s signals to determine what it needs to maximize wellness,” explained Jason Russell, Oura’s VP of consumer software product. “In doing so, we hope to revolutionize how health is approached by shifting from reactive sick care to proactive, preventative, long-term wellness.”</p><p>The company also launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-labs-members-test-experience-announced">Oura labs</a>, a new in-app experience for iOS users to test out new and upcoming features like the “Symptom Radar,”—which helps users understand how their bodies react to fatigue, high activity levels, and illness.</p><p>Analysts predict that these devices will soon gain even more functionality, such as being able to make contactless payments and connect with augmented reality. Early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-developing-a-smart-ring">patents</a> suggested Samsung launch a smart ring with not only health-tracking capabilities but also the ability to interact with and control other devices. </p><p>IDC predicts that advancements in ring technology and lower prices will push more people to get them over the next four years. They forecast smart ring shipments to increase to approximately 3.25 million by 2028, more than triple the number of shipments in 2023, while their average selling price is expected to drop to $270 from the current ASP of roughly $290 as more companies enter the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:598px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.16%;"><img id="QEQ3WEZynM5j6sEe2EQt3C" name="Smartrings-forcast-IDC.png" alt="Smart rings forecast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEQ3WEZynM5j6sEe2EQt3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="598" height="593" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC - Jitesh Ubrani)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“We see tremendous growth in this market, and eventually, the ring will go beyond just health tracking to become more interactive and potentially be used as an input device in XR or tied into the smart home as a presence sensor or on-body sensor that can adjust your surroundings based on your preferences,” Ubrani explains.</p><p>It’s also worth noting long-term benefits for consumers. Tech companies churn out new versions of their smartwatches yearly, each with a heftier price tag and more features often not accessible on older models. In contrast, smart rings seem to have a clear advantage when it comes to longevity.</p><p>Over the past three years, Oura’s Gen 3 smart ring has consistently received new features on the same device without needing a new model. This is something consumers could benefit from as companies like Samsung may extend the value of the device by bringing more features over a number of years before launching a new model.</p>

<p>The future for these smart rings looks promising, and according to Russell, three key trends are driving the evolution of the smart ring market: a focus on longevity-driven health management, the demand for personalized wellness solutions, and an increasing emphasis on mental health and holistic well-being.</p><p>"Individuals seek proactive strategies to optimize their health and lifespan. Oura is at the forefront of this movement by providing our members with accurate insights, empowering them to embrace healthy habits, and paving the way for a longer and healthier life," Russell added.</p><p>Samsung intends to take it a step further and leverage its hardware and software ecosystem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which would help with AI-based coaching to calculate health metrics and offer daily recommendations for the Galaxy Ring owners. We could also see smart rings from other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/future-apple-ring-tipped-to-join-the-companys-wearable-category-as-oura-samsung-and-others-are-placed-on-notice">such as Apple</a>, which may help drive smart ring adoption even further, especially if companies allow these devices to work <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-samsung-needs-to-release-galaxy-ring-on-iphone-challenge-apple-ring">regardless of the OS it&apos;s attached to</a>.</p><p>For now, smart rings are being used as companions to other wearables. However, as advancements in smart ring technology progress and become more affordable in the future, there&apos;s a clear path for these discreet wearables to make their way onto more hands.</p>

<hr>
<p>Case and accessory makers for mobile devices can&apos;t stay away from controversy in recent months. After Casetify came under fire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dbrand-and-jerryrigeverything-sue-casetify">allegedly stealing Dbrand&apos;s custom designs</a>, Dbrand is now involved in a scuffle of its own.</p><p>The company, known for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">device skins</a> and snarky online presence, made a joke about a customer&apos;s last name after they asked the company for support. Dbrand&apos;s original post on X (formerly Twitter) has been viewed over seven million times and was called out by users in replies as awful, unprofessional, and racist.</p><p>In light of the backlash, Dbrand offered the customer $10,000 and a personal apology, the company shared today.</p><p>The fiasco started when Bhuwan Chitransh reached out to Dbrand on X about a MacBook skin purchased from the company that showed signs of discoloration. </p><p>In a reply, Dbrand&apos;s customer support account (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/robot/status/1777459061065146763" target="_blank">@robot</a>) said: "Like most surfaces, dirt and grime can accumulate on the surface of a skin over time. You can clean it using a microfiber cloth lightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol." The account also stated that the customer should send an email to Dbrand if there are any further issues. </p><p>Afterward, Dbrand&apos;s main account — followed by 2.3 million X users — quote replied to Chitransh&apos;s original request for help with the following response:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your last name is basically shit rash, be serious https://t.co/SmQd5So5bS<a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1777823124479734097">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company originally had a bullish response to the backlash that followed. While opinions of Dbrand&apos;s joke varied, there seemed to be a consensus in the replies to the company&apos;s original post that the comment was offensive. One user told Dbrand to "keep the same energy in the apology tweet," to which the company replied "no." Dbrand&apos;s official account continued to post memes and snarky replies to the controversy on Tuesday, April 9. </p><p>Dbrand posted an apology on Wednesday, April 10, admitting that the company "made fun of a guy&apos;s name" and "it was a huge fumble." The brand also offered the customer $10,000 "as a gesture of goodwill" and rejected claims that the move was hush money. "To clarify, this offer has no strings attached," Dbrand said in a DM to Chitransh. "We just want to make amends for our lapse in judgement and the chaos that ensued in your world."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well that escalated quickly.1. Yes - we made fun of a guy's name. It was a huge fumble.2. We apologized to him directly and offered him $10,000 as a gesture of goodwill.3. We've been poking fun at customers on social media for over a decade now. We're not going to stop, but…<a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1778136614788600226">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>However, whether Dbrand is actually remorseful for its comments is up for debate. "We&apos;ve been poking fun at customers on social media for over a decade now," it said in the so-called apology post. "We&apos;re not going to stop, but maybe next time you&apos;ll be the one who gets $10,000."</p><p>Android Central contacted Dbrand for comment about the controversy, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>
