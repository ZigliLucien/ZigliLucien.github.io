In the past, that used to be limited to OnePlus or Google; OxygenOS delivered everything I wanted in an Android interface, and even though the cameras weren&apos;t the best, the fluidity of the software and the customizability meant I inevitably went back to a OnePlus phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, Pixels had their shortcomings — mostly around the hardware — but Google&apos;s unique software features combined with outstanding cameras made using a Pixel a delight. In recent years, I found myself using Samsung phones more and more; I called the Galaxy S23 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-my-favorite-android-phone-2023">one of my favorite phones</a> last year, and I used that device for over three months at a stretch.</p><p>So when I got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, I thought it would be just as exciting to use as its predecessor — but I was wrong. The phone turned out to be too much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>; even though it has a titanium chassis, it is the same weight, and that immediately took the sheen off the device. By contrast, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> is 19g lighter than its predecessor, and the difference is instantly noticeable — it is significantly easier to hold and use, and I thought Samsung would have similar gains on offer. </p><p>In fact, I didn&apos;t notice any major differences between the Galaxy S24 Ultra and its predecessor in daily use. I tested enough phones to know that we&apos;re past the point where we get generational gains year-on-year, but even by the usual iterative update cycle, the Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn&apos;t push the needle in a meaningful way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-7.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than a brighter AMOLED panel and updated internal hardware, Samsung didn&apos;t make any tangible changes. The cameras are the same as last year, but to its credit, Samsung tweaked the algorithms to deliver better shots, and this is clearly evident in low-light situations and when using the telephoto lenses.</p><p>But even then, the Galaxy S24 Ultra isn&apos;t the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phone</a> you can buy today — far from it. In fact, going from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Honor&apos;s Magic 6 Pro</a> to the Galaxy S24 Ultra felt like a downgrade. This year&apos;s flagships have raised the bar significantly, with Chinese brands in particular delivering stellar cameras across the board.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Honor Magic 6 Pro, OPPO Find X7 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> all have better camera packages than the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and they deliver versatile lenses that take magnificent photos and videos in just about any situation. Samsung, meanwhile, positioned AI as the key differentiator with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and as someone who is ambivalent about generative AI, I just didn&apos;t care about all the new additions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CzM4oZ5wAodXHwiRJqKzv5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-5.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CzM4oZ5wAodXHwiRJqKzv5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted Samsung to roll out exciting upgrades over the Galaxy S23 Ultra, but the brand instead chose to play it safe and delivered a phone that doesn&apos;t stand out in any meaningful way. It&apos;s no wonder, then, that I decided to switch to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra as soon as it showed up.</p><p>While other brands push the boundaries of camera tech every year, Samsung coasts along and stays relevant because of its unique market positioning. Samsung is the biggest Android manufacturer by a considerable margin, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is the only flagship choice in North America other than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s biggest Chinese rivals don&apos;t have a foothold in the U.S., so the brand doesn&apos;t need to worry about its dominance in the region. That situation isn&apos;t likely to change anytime soon, and therefore, Samsung really doesn&apos;t have to innovate or deliver more than the bare minimum of upgrades.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra isn&apos;t a bad phone by any measure; it just doesn&apos;t offer any material upgrades over its predecessor, and that ultimately makes it boring. As someone who uses over 75 phones a year, I get to be incredibly picky about the devices I choose as my daily driver. And in 2024, the Galaxy S24 Ultra just doesn&apos;t measure up. It is a great choice if you&apos;re on an older device and want to upgrade — it isn&apos;t the phone for me.</p>

<ul><li>At Google Cloud Next '24, OPPO and OnePlus announced that they're rolling out the Gemini Ultra 1.0 LLM to their devices.</li><li>In addition to the LLM, select Google Cloud AI features will be debuting on these devices.</li><li>The integration will go live sometime later in 2024.</li></ul>
<p>AI is everywhere these days, and while OPPO didn&apos;t share its plans to integrate generative AI when it launched ColorOS 14 late last year, that&apos;s changing now. At the Google Cloud Next &apos;24 event, OPPO announced that it is bringing Google&apos;s Gemini Ultra 1.0 to OPPO and OnePlus phones later in 2024.</p><p>Google unveiled Gemini Ultra 1.0 earlier in 2024, its state-of-the-art AI LLM that powers the Gemini Advanced chatbot. Google says the LLM is designed to handle "highly complex tasks," and that it understands context to deliver useful recommendations and insights.</p><p>OPPO says that the integration of Gemini Ultra 1.0 will "completely change the way users interact" with their devices. While the LLM is coming to OPPO and OnePlus phones later in the year, there&apos;s no mention of what phones will get the chatbot — that information will be shared later on.</p><p>Nicole Zhang, General Manager of AI Product for OPPO and OnePlus, talked about the four key pillars that will drive the use of AI on phones: "it must utilize resources effectively, possess self-learning capabilities, perceive the real world, and bring creativity to its users."</p><p>Outside of that, there isn&apos;t much information available at the moment. OPPO uses its custom AndesGPT to deliver features like AI Eraser on its phones, and this is similar to what Google offers with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Eraser on the Pixels</a>. Clearly, the manufacturer is looking to bolster its on-device AI suite, and with Honor going all-in on AI with the likes of Magic Portal, it is likely we will see more Chinese manufacturers introduce similar features down the line. Interestingly, all of these features will be coming to OnePlus phones as well.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a redesign of the Sleep tracking views in the Fitbit app for iOS and Android. </li><li>A new page shows an at-a-glance breakdown of last night's sleep, your sleep score, and sleep timeline in the same place.</li><li>Users can also manually scrub the sleep timeline and view insights from their sleep habits as part of the overhauled experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sleep views in the Fitbit app are changing starting Wednesday, April 10, as Google rolls out a Material You redesign. The company already started bringing the Fitbit app&apos;s design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-app-redesign-arrives">more in line with other Google apps last year</a>, but not every feature or page saw a visual overhaul. Sleep tracking data was one such example, since pages related to it looked identical to the older Fitbit app design.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Redesigned-Sleep-experience-now-in-the-Fitbit-app/ba-p/5576113" target="_blank">Fitbit community post</a>, the fresh Sleep views and new features are finally starting to roll out now.</p><p>The older design, which featured bright purple colors and stats spread across multiple pages, is giving way to a much simpler one. One page aims to provide you with all the information you need about last night&apos;s sleep. That includes an at-a-glance view that displays your sleep duration, sleep score, and timeline. The sleep timeline is interactive, using different colors to reflect time spent in light, deep, and REM sleep stages — as well as time spent awake. </p><p>While the new look still features Fitbit&apos;s classic purple and teal accent colors, they are much more muted now. The background is now grey rather than pure white, and the page looks more cohesive than sectioned off. Generally, it visually matches the rest of the Fitbit app and other Google apps featuring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You design language</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ" name="Fitbit-Sleep-Redesign-2.jpg" alt="A Fitbit app image edited with a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnFkmxWvKxTJkdmRtEJzBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sleep timeline has a scrubbing tool that can be used to uncover insights about specific moments during your sleep. The data can be narrowed down to minutes using this tool, and it could give you answers to questions like whether you woke up in the middle night or were in a deep sleep. </p><p>On a larger scale, you can pull sleep-tracking data from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit devices</a> over week, month, and year thresholds to get a view of your sleep habits over time. This will show how consistently a user is meeting the sleep targets set in the Fitbit app. It can also inform users how their sleep score and other metrics fluctuate over a longer sample size. </p><p>Though the redesign was announced on Wednesday, it has not yet been rolled out widely. It&apos;ll reach all iOS and Android users soon enough.

Smaller wearable tech has gained momentum due to its compact size and ease of use, with smart rings leading that charge. Usually in the size of traditional rings, these gadgets, designed to track sleep and fitness, are rapidly gaining popularity.</p><p>With a plethora of wearables in the market, can passive smart rings compete with more active devices like smartwatches and fitness bands? Or is this just a passing trend that will eventually lead nowhere? According to analysts, smart rings have their place in the wearable market but may not be the smartwatch replacement many are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-smart-ring-2">Rise of the smart ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-sensors.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air sitting atop a rock, showing the visible sensors on the inner ring." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you think of a smart ring, the first name that pops into your mind is Oura. This brand has not only carved out a niche in the smart ring market but also established itself as one of the leading players in this industry, selling over a million of these tiny wearables in over 98 countries. Users can track key indicators like heart rate, sleep stages, stress, and more to get a snapshot of their daily health and readiness. </p><p>After launching two rings in 2016 and 2018, Oura began to gain traction in 2021 with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> due to its improved tracking capabilities for metrics like temperature and blood oxygen sensing, features that were still up-and-coming on regular smartwatches. Oura also made strategic partnerships with entities such as the NBA, bringing the brand and its product to the limelight over other health-tracking devices and companies already diving into the smart ring market. However, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was the real catalyst for the ring’s popularity.</p><p>“That said, some of these practices were already in motion before the pandemic, and Oura was the last remaining brand amongst rings since Motiv got acquired,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s Worldwide Device Trackers, said in an interview. Motive was one such company that dove into health-tracking smart rings until it decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/motiv-shifts-its-smart-rings-health-tracking-biometrics-following-acquisition">shift its focus to biometrics</a>, offering a different approach to the wearables with a different set of features.</p><p>However, Oura isn’t the only company that wants to explore how this small fitness tracker could replace bulky smartwatches someday. Samsung showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona earlier this year and is gearing up to launch the device later this year. Other brands, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ultrahuman-home-tells-you-why-youre-not-sleeping-well">Ultrahuman</a>, Evie, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-launch-ces-2024">Amazfit</a>, have all launched versions of smart rings, trying to cram multiple features into the device and blurring the lines between smartwatches and rings.</p>
<h2 id="the-smart-ring-apos-s-biggest-rival-2">The smart ring&apos;s biggest rival</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3752px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) next to the Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wb9oyrF5LEDLoYMfLh6SJH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3752" height="2111" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to comprehensive abilities, smartwatches can make calls, help you browse through notifications, look at photos, and even let you respond to texts, in addition to being a fitness tracker. However, that’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-smart-rings-work">not the case for smart rings</a>; despite having several health-tracking capabilities, they still fall short in some areas. Hanish Bhatia, associate director of Devices & Ecosystem at Counterpoint Research, feels that “smart rings are likely to coexist with smartwatches and not replace them.”</p><p>Ubrani agrees, noting that smart rings have become a convenient alternative, but cautions that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-has-huge-potential-but-also-huge-roadblocks">they’re not for everyone</a>. He warns that “the ring form factor certainly offers many benefits over a watch, but it’s not a home run as it often increases complexity when it comes to inventory management, finding the perfect fit for users, or tracking fitness goals in detail. As such, it won’t be a smartwatch replacement for everyone.” </p><p>Fitness enthusiasts feel these rings track certain metrics more accurately than a smartwatch due to the fit. While wearing the Ultrahuman Ring, Michael Hicks, Android Central’s wearables editor, expressed how it’s much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">easier to wear a ring to sleep</a> when compared to something that weighs more than 30g.</p><p>In a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/17yo3zh/should_i_get_an_oura_ring_to_replace_my_smartwatch/">thread</a>, a user explains how they choose between wearables based on the activity that needs tracking, noting that they don’t rely on Oura for fitness tracking but for its sleep monitoring. “I use my Apple Watch and Oura watch together. Like most people…Apple Watch for fitness and oura ring for sleep.”</p><p>Another says they chose the ring “because it’s a small device I can wear throughout the day and night without being bothered by its presence on my hands.”</p><p>Bhatia notes that while some of the smartwatch and smart ring features overlap, it might be detrimental to compare a smaller-sized wearable to that of a smartwatch. “I think they’re different products, especially when considering convenience and utility.”</p>
<h2 id="beyond-fitness-and-sleep-tracking-2">Beyond fitness and sleep tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-black-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings hold great potential beyond basic fitness tracking because they fit several sensors into a small gadget and can give users a more holistic view of their overall fitness.</p><p>Oura is looking at advancing health-tracking sensors that translate day-to-day into actionable data and insights, “It’s about listening to your body’s signals to determine what it needs to maximize wellness,” explained Jason Russell, Oura’s VP of consumer software product. “In doing so, we hope to revolutionize how health is approached by shifting from reactive sick care to proactive, preventative, long-term wellness.”</p><p>The company also launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-labs-members-test-experience-announced">Oura labs</a>, a new in-app experience for iOS users to test out new and upcoming features like the “Symptom Radar,”—which helps users understand how their bodies react to fatigue, high activity levels, and illness.</p><p>Analysts predict that these devices will soon gain even more functionality, such as being able to make contactless payments and connect with augmented reality. Early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-developing-a-smart-ring">patents</a> suggested Samsung launch a smart ring with not only health-tracking capabilities but also the ability to interact with and control other devices. </p><p>IDC predicts that advancements in ring technology and lower prices will push more people to get them over the next four years. They forecast smart ring shipments to increase to approximately 3.25 million by 2028, more than triple the number of shipments in 2023, while their average selling price is expected to drop to $270 from the current ASP of roughly $290 as more companies enter the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:598px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.16%;"><img id="QEQ3WEZynM5j6sEe2EQt3C" name="Smartrings-forcast-IDC.png" alt="Smart rings forecast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEQ3WEZynM5j6sEe2EQt3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="598" height="593" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC - Jitesh Ubrani)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“We see tremendous growth in this market, and eventually, the ring will go beyond just health tracking to become more interactive and potentially be used as an input device in XR or tied into the smart home as a presence sensor or on-body sensor that can adjust your surroundings based on your preferences,” Ubrani explains.</p><p>It’s also worth noting long-term benefits for consumers. Tech companies churn out new versions of their smartwatches yearly, each with a heftier price tag and more features often not accessible on older models. In contrast, smart rings seem to have a clear advantage when it comes to longevity.</p><p>Over the past three years, Oura’s Gen 3 smart ring has consistently received new features on the same device without needing a new model. This is something consumers could benefit from as companies like Samsung may extend the value of the device by bringing more features over a number of years before launching a new model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-updating.jpg" alt="Updating the Oura Ring (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSjLDjSo2z7e4ATafr2yWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The future for these smart rings looks promising, and according to Russell, three key trends are driving the evolution of the smart ring market: a focus on longevity-driven health management, the demand for personalized wellness solutions, and an increasing emphasis on mental health and holistic well-being.</p><p>"Individuals seek proactive strategies to optimize their health and lifespan. Oura is at the forefront of this movement by providing our members with accurate insights, empowering them to embrace healthy habits, and paving the way for a longer and healthier life," Russell added.</p><p>Samsung intends to take it a step further and leverage its hardware and software ecosystem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which would help with AI-based coaching to calculate health metrics and offer daily recommendations for the Galaxy Ring owners. We could also see smart rings from other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/future-apple-ring-tipped-to-join-the-companys-wearable-category-as-oura-samsung-and-others-are-placed-on-notice">such as Apple</a>, which may help drive smart ring adoption even further, especially if companies allow these devices to work <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-samsung-needs-to-release-galaxy-ring-on-iphone-challenge-apple-ring">regardless of the OS it&apos;s attached to</a>.</p><p>For now, smart rings are being used as companions to other wearables. However, as advancements in smart ring technology progress and become more affordable in the future, there&apos;s a clear path for these discreet wearables to make their way onto more hands.</p>

<p>Case and accessory makers for mobile devices can&apos;t stay away from controversy in recent months. After Casetify came under fire for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/dbrand-and-jerryrigeverything-sue-casetify">allegedly stealing Dbrand&apos;s custom designs</a>, Dbrand is now involved in a scuffle of its own.</p><p>The company, known for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">device skins</a> and snarky online presence, made a joke about a customer&apos;s last name after they asked the company for support.

The account also stated that the customer should send an email to Dbrand if there are any further issues. </p><p>Afterward, Dbrand&apos;s main account — followed by 2.3 million X users — quote replied to Chitransh&apos;s original request for help with the following response:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your last name is basically shit rash, be serious https://t.co/SmQd5So5bS<a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1777823124479734097">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company originally had a bullish response to the backlash that followed. While opinions of Dbrand&apos;s joke varied, there seemed to be a consensus in the replies to the company&apos;s original post that the comment was offensive. One user told Dbrand to "keep the same energy in the apology tweet," to which the company replied "no." Dbrand&apos;s official account continued to post memes and snarky replies to the controversy on Tuesday, April 9. </p><p>Dbrand posted an apology on Wednesday, April 10, admitting that the company "made fun of a guy&apos;s name" and "it was a huge fumble." The brand also offered the customer $10,000 "as a gesture of goodwill" and rejected claims that the move was hush money. "To clarify, this offer has no strings attached," Dbrand said in a DM to Chitransh. "We just want to make amends for our lapse in judgement and the chaos that ensued in your world."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well that escalated quickly.1. Yes - we made fun of a guy's name.

<p>However, whether Dbrand is actually remorseful for its comments is up for debate. "We&apos;ve been poking fun at customers on social media for over a decade now," it said in the so-called apology post. "We&apos;re not going to stop, but maybe next time you&apos;ll be the one who gets $10,000."</p><p>Android Central contacted Dbrand for comment about the controversy, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>So you just got a Google Pixel Watch 2, and you really aren&apos;t sure where to start. Well, not only are you getting one of the sleekest smartwatches on the market, but Google managed to provide quite a few upgrades over the original Pixel Watch. Perhaps the best part of it all is seeing new features and improvements made on the software side of things.</p><p>Mant features are similar to what you&apos;ll find on the original Pixel Watch, but there are still some differences between the two. With that in mind, let&apos;s dive into the first things to do with the Pixel Watch 2. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-sos-and-fall-detection"><span>Set up Emergency SOS and Fall Detection</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GeTNxpRB7RFEtipPpZa8XW" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-Fall-Detection-02.jpg" alt="Enabling Fall Detection on a Google Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GeTNxpRB7RFEtipPpZa8XW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First introduced in late 2022, Google added the ability for your Pixel Watch to reach out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-emergency-sos-pixel-watch">Emergency Services</a> or a loved one if you need assistance. Although we hope you&apos;ll never have to use it, we still recommend getting everything set up, just in case. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Wake your Pixel Watch</strong> by tapping the screen or pressing either the side button or the crown.</p><p>2. <strong>Swipe down </strong>on the watch face to reveal the <strong>Quick Settings panel</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Settings (cog icon)</strong> button.</p><p>4. Scroll down and tap <strong>Safety & Emergency</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>.</p><p>6. Tap the toggle next to the <strong>Emergency gesture</strong> and <strong>Countdown alarm</strong> to enable them.</p><p>7. Go back to the previous screen and tap <strong>Emergency location service</strong>.</p><p>8. Enable <strong>Emergency location service</strong> functionality.</p><p>9. Exit the Settings app.</p>
<p>The feature is available for both generations of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>, with the only difference coming down to whether you own an LTE or Wi-Fi model. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> with LTE, your smartwatch will be able to make the necessary calls directly. Otherwise, your phone will need to be within range of your smartwatch as it will rely on the phone to make the call. </p><p>Another new feature introduced by Google for the Pixel Watch lineup is the ability for your wearable to detect when you fall. It does so by utilizing on-device Machine Learning paired with the built-in motion sensors. It, too, is available on both the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2, but like Emergency SOS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-enable-fall-detection-pixel-watch">Fall Detection</a> needs to first be enabled. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Watch</strong> app on your phone. </p><p>2. Scroll down and select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Fall detection</strong>. </p><p>4. Tap the toggle next to <strong>Use fall detection</strong> to the <strong>On</strong> position.</p>
<p>When your Pixel Watch 2 recognizes that you&apos;ve fallen and need assistance, it will "vibrate, sound an alarm, and check if you need help." This happens after 30 seconds, and if you don&apos;t respond, it will then call emergency services using an "automated message that provides your location and requests help."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sync-dnd-bedtime-mode-with-your-phone"><span>Sync DND & Bedtime Mode with your phone</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VYPLHMifhSMADFA8sDSNjX" name="google-pixel-watch-2-review-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VYPLHMifhSMADFA8sDSNjX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>One of the more surprising features introduced with the Pixel Watch 2 was the ability to finally sync Do Not Disturb and Bedtime Mode with your phone. This has been a long-requested feature, and until it was revealed, left many wondering why it wasn&apos;t already available. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Pixel Watch</strong> app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Notifications</strong>. </p><p>3. Swipe down and tap the toggle next to <strong>Sync across watch and phone</strong>. </p>

<p>Previously you would have to set up the DND and Bedtime Mode on your phone and watch, separately. It was more of a headache than anything else, so needless to say we&apos;re happy to see this feature added.</p>

<p>When Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-december-2023-update">December 2023 Feature Drop</a>, the company finally added the new Watch Unlock feature. This was originally introduced back in 2022 but had yet to actually make its way to devices. </p><p>Watch Unlock is fairly similar to the Smart Lock functionality that we&apos;ve enjoyed on Android for years. With this feature set up and enabled, you&apos;ll be able to automatically unlock your phone without needing to enter a passcode. As you might suspect, this feature needs to first be enabled before you can start using it. </p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Watch </strong>app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Watch preferences</strong>. </p><p>3. Tap <strong>Security</strong>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s one thing to swap out your watch band for something that matches your mood. But, just doing something as simple as using a different watch face can change the way you view smartwatches.

<p>Keep in mind that you don&apos;t have to stick to the built-in watch faces that Google provides. There are plenty of watch faces and apps you can download from the Play Store if Google doesn&apos;t have anything that tickles your fancy. Check out the next section to get started with the Play Store on your Pixel Watch 2.</p>

<p>One area that used to be a point of contention when it came to the Wear OS platform was the quality of the apps. In 2023, Google began making strides to change that, as it introduced new requirements for developers in order to provide a "basic consistent experience across all apps." </p><p>While smartwatch apps aren&apos;t nearly as feature-rich as their phone counterparts, they can still come in handy. Plus, with the addition of complications to various watch faces, your Pixel Watch 2 can become even more versatile than it already is.</p><p>When you go through the initial setup process, you&apos;ll be prompted to install apps that are already available on your phone. But you can also manually search for and install apps right from the Google Play Store app on your wrist. Google has even made it easy to install <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">Wear OS apps</a> from your phone, thanks to the drop-down menu next to the install button in the Play Store.  </p>

<p>Along with using a different watch face, another way to customize your Pixel Watch 2 is to utilize a different watch band. Maybe the default silicone band has just worn out, or you want something to match your outfit. Thankfully, there are a plethora of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">Pixel Watch 2 bands</a> available, even with Google still utilizing a proprietary band connector. </p><p>You can even go so far as to use <em>almost</em> any band that tickles your fancy, as you can grab an adapter, attach a traditional 20mm watch band, and be on your way. This makes for endless combinations for you to mix and match depending on what you&apos;re doing, or your mood.</p>

<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> is that many of them use a proprietary charger.

<p>Although the hardware might have been a bit lackluster, in some regards, that&apos;s not the case with Fitbit&apos;s mobile app. It&apos;s become pretty clear that Google is set on slowly rebranding the Fitbit that we knew and loved. However, Google has also shown that the Fitbit app will be how you keep track of your various workouts and metrics.</p><p>Google includes six months of Fitbit Premium with every Pixel Watch 2 purchase, giving you access to "exclusive workouts, mindfulness sessions, and more." Fitbit Premium also offers a variety of other features, including personalized insights and even a wellness report. </p><p>Even if you opt out of Premium after the six-month trial has concluded, the Fitbit app still serves as the hub for tracking your various health metrics. During the setup process, you&apos;re prompted to connect the Fitbit app to your Pixel Watch 2, and from there, we recommend checking out what the app has to offer. Plus, the six-month trial should take plenty of time to determine whether it&apos;s worth signing up for the subscription or just relying on the free features.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/">announced</a> on Wednesday, April 10, that it is expanding its popular AI photo editing features in Google Photos. Not only will more users have access to certain features, but they will be able to use these features at no extra cost and without a subscription.</p><p>According to the company, these features include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a>, Portrait Light, and more. These will work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> running Android 8 and newer or iPhones running iOS 15 or higher, and devices must have 3GB or more. For Chromebook users, the features are limited to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-models-now-available">Chromebook Plus</a> devices running ChromeOS 118 or higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PYyQcceTs9Ze3B25JPr42j" name="Google-Photos-ai-editing-tools.jpg" alt="Google Photos Magic Editor and Photo Unblur" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PYyQcceTs9Ze3B25JPr42j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to expanding these features across more devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> is set to expand beyond the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series, allowing "all Pixel devices" to make more complex edits. However, while these features are free for more users, the company will limit the number of Magic Editor saves they can make. Android and iOS users will only be able to make 10 of these saves per month unless subscribed to a 2TB or higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plan, which will unlock unlimited saves. Pixel users will also automatically have unlimited saves.</p><p>For Magic Editor, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128850?visit_id=638483618616951387-3483905442&p=editing_features&rd=1&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-cinematic-photo%2Cuse-suggested-edits%2Cuse-tools%2Csave-new-shots-from-your-motion-photos%2Cuse-magic-editor">support page</a> notes that "your device must have a 64-bit chipset with at least 4 GB RAM and Android 8.0 and up."</p><p>In 2023, Google surprisingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/magic-eraser-google-one-android-ios">expanded the Pixel-exclusive Magic Eraser</a> to more users through Google Photos, but the feature required a subscription if you didn&apos;t already own a Pixel phone. The fact that even more AI features will be available without a subscription is a welcome surprise.</p><p>Users can expect to see these features rolling out starting on May 15.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A feature that tracks and finds lost devices isn&apos;t a new idea. Both Google and Apple have been doing it for years, but as technology advances, things get updated, and Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">started rolling out the new Find My Device</a> network in North America.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-can-now-quickly-google-find-my-phone-find-lost-android-device">idea isn&apos;t new</a>, but how it&apos;s done and what it can do sure is. With a network of well over a billion devices, you can now find your lost phone — and plenty of other things — more easily and in a way that makes it secure by design.</p>
<p>Part of what makes it better is what it can do. Five cool new features make the new feature better than the older version:</p><p><strong>1. The ability to locate offline devices.</strong> You can locate your Android phone or tablet on a map and send a notification to make them ring even when they aren&apos;t connected to a network. If you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro</a>, this even works when the phone is turned off or the battery is dead. We&apos;ll talk more about that a bit later.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use new Bluetooth trackers to keep track of other things.</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Third-party companies</a> are soon releasing small tags for use with Google&apos;s network. You can attach these tags to anything and keep tabs on it through the Find My Device network. They&apos;re also built to be compatible with Google and Apple&apos;s unknown tracker alert system to make sure nobody can use them without you knowing it.</p><p><strong>3. Locate nearby devices. </strong>If you&apos;re close to something you&apos;re looking for, a button will appear that lets you figure out exactly where it is. As you get warmer, the shape fills and as you get colder it shrinks. Nifty.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ" name="find-my-device-1.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1179" height="663" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>4. Use Google Nest devices to help find things at home.</strong> With things like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Nest Home</a> as part of the new network, it&apos;s easier to find lost things in your house. Your Nest devices only work to find your stuff in your house, thanks to the built-in home protection of the new network.</p><p><strong>5. Share accessories with your family or friends.</strong> You&apos;ll be able to share a compatible Bluetooth accessory or tracker with others so they can keep tabs on where it&apos;s at, too.</p>
<p>So it seems like the new feature is really cool and very comparable to what Apple has been doing with it&apos;s own network. Under the surface it&apos;s a lot different, though. Let&apos;s dig in.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.68%;"><img id="zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY" name="google-find-my-device-locator-io-2023.jpg" alt="Using proximity to locate a lost item through the Find My Device network." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="837" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The short answer is Bluetooth. Almost everything has a Bluetooth connection nowadays, and leveraging it in a way that reports where it&apos;s at concerning other Bluetooth devices makes sense. Never lose your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">favorite earbuds</a> again.</p><p>Imagine you&apos;ve attached a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-joins-google-find-my-device-tracker-debut">Chipolo tracking tag</a> to your keyring. It has a Bluetooth radio inside that "broadcasts" its location so that other devices that are compatible with and have enrolled in the new Find My Device network can "listen" to it.</p>
<p>All these devices report data back to Google in aggregate, and if you want to find your keyring with its attached Chipolo tracker, you&apos;ll get a location based on how far it is from other devices.</p><p>Knowing how far it is from one device does nothing, but when you have billions of devices, you can get a very close estimate of the actual location. When you get close, the strength of the Bluetooth signal is used to fill a shape on your screen until you&apos;re right on top of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf" name="Google-Find-My.jpg" alt="A render of Find My device against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing left to do is make it all secure and private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Google tries to do this</a> in a few different ways, such as through aggregation and encryption.</p><p>You&apos;ll need to opt-in to the feature, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14796936?hl=en&ref_topic=7651004&sjid=3104889368197014343-NC">you&apos;ll have three options</a> — opt out completely, contribute to aggregation, or use the network without contributing to aggregation. To explain exactly what Google means by aggregation, here are its own words:</p><p>"With aggregation, the Find My Device network waits until multiple Android devices have detected a lost item. Find My Device then shows the owner of the lost item a center point calculated from the multiple location reports."</p>
<p>What this does is tell a user where a thing is without telling them where any of the devices that help find it are located. If your phone tells Google where a luggage tag is located, the person who owns the luggage tag has no way of knowing where you are or that you contributed at all.</p><p>In addition, when Google sends location data to you, it&apos;s end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the tracker owner and anyone it&apos;s shared with. This means nobody but you (or another person you authorized) can use it — this data can&apos;t be shared even if you want it to be shared.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.00%;"><img id="HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem" name="find-my-device-3.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two other important features are worth noting. The service has what Google calls "At Home Protection," and the way it works is that as long as you&apos;re in the places you&apos;ve designated as Home, your Android devices don&apos;t contribute location reports back to the Find My Device network. Nobody can use this data to find out where you live.</p><p>The last thing worth noting is that all of this is compliant with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">unknown tracker alerts industry standard</a>. If someone tries to use a tag to track you, you&apos;ll get notified once your phone notices it is close to you and stays close to you. If someone sticks a tracker on your car or in your purse, it&apos;s going to tell you.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-not-to-love-2">What&apos;s not to love?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure that privacy advocates will look closely at what Google has done, find things that aren&apos;t ideal, and maybe Google will address them. In the meantime, I see two issues that need to be discussed.</p><p>The first is tracking your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>&apos;s location when the phone is turned off, or the battery is dead. All Google says is, "Thanks to specialized Pixel hardware, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro owners will also be able to find their devices if they&apos;re powered off or the battery is dead." That&apos;s not helpful at all, and with Google&apos;s track record when it comes to privacy, we need to know more.</p><p>I expect Google will tell us more at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O</a>, and in the meantime, I&apos;ve reached out to the company in search of more concrete answers regarding this "specialized hardware" and how it works. If I get any, I&apos;ll share them.</p>
<p>The second thing isn&apos;t an issue with the service at all. If it works as well as it sounds, it&apos;s a crying shame Apple isn&apos;t on board.</p><p>Yes, Apple has a service that uses a high-frequency radio to do the same thing, and if you&apos;re in a country like the U.S., where half the people have an iPhone, it works well. However, the downside is that it won&apos;t work if you&apos;re not in an area with a high saturation of iPhone users (and such places exist in the world).</p><p>If Apple wanted to, it could piggyback on Google&apos;s service and make it better for everyone. Sometimes, companies should stop squabbling and do what&apos;s best for their customers. This is one of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hate the idea of anything tracking me, and I don&apos;t trust Google when it comes to collecting data because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-incognito-mode-update">the sketchy things</a> it has been caught doing. However, this service seems like it&apos;s worth it, and with the safeguards Google has in place, it seems secure and safe. I&apos;ll be using it once trackers become available after Google I/O.</p>
