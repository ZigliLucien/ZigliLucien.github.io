                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I didn&apos;t pay too much attention to the Find X7 Ultra when I got the device in mid-January. It wasn&apos;t launching outside China, so I focused instead on devices that would debut globally. Then I got caught up in the 2024 phone launch cycle, and the Find X7 Ultra sat in a drawer for the better part of a month.</p><p>I used the phone a little bit while testing the cameras on the Magic 6 Pro, but it was only after I started using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> that I started to understand its potential. I did a round of testing with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Find X7 Ultra, and had to do a double-take when I pulled up both sets of photos on my monitor; surely, there must have been an error with the labeling, because the Find X7 Ultra was <em>better</em> than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in a lot of situations.</p><p>But there wasn&apos;t. The Find X7 Ultra somehow managed to take better photos, and portrait shots in particular were the best of any phone I used to date. So as soon as I was done testing the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, I switched over to the Find X7 Ultra. Yes, there were annoyances on the software side, as the Chinese ColorOS version is considerably different to the global build, but in the month and a half that I used the phone, it has been magnificent.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I realized that I wasted a lot of time testing other phones when I should have been using the Find X7 Ultra instead. Welcome to the most underrated phone of 2024.</p>

<p>OPPO launched the Find X7 Ultra on January 8, and the phone is limited to the brand&apos;s home country, just like its predecessor. It is available in blue, black, and brown color variants, and all three models have a dual-tone design and leather backs. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&apos;s a 16GB/256GB model and a 16GB/512GB variant.</p><p>You can get the Find X7 Ultra by using Chinese resellers, but considering how different ColorOS is to the global version, I wouldn&apos;t suggest doing so with the device.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-design"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-27.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no contest — the Find X7 Ultra is the best-looking phone I used in 2024. OPPO didn&apos;t make too many changes to the design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a>, but there are tons of smaller tweaks that make the Find X7 Ultra easier to hold and use, and much better to look at. The defining characteristic is the two-tone finish — my unit has a blue leather back, with a white frosted glass panel covering a third of the back, encircling the camera island.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sXHf5JhGSJYcNxUHUKfRZm" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-6.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sXHf5JhGSJYcNxUHUKfRZm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The effect is nothing short of gorgeous, and the Find X7 Ultra grabs attention like no other phone around. In the few instances I used the Find X7 Ultra outdoors, strangers came up to ask me about the phone — the only other device that got noticed anywhere as much was the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZMTFzzpGfdxwhDjh4RXZWi" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-3.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMTFzzpGfdxwhDjh4RXZWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, a big part of the design is the oversized camera island; it is even larger than last year, and the grooved ring bordering the island along with the silver inlay makes the cameras stand out much more than previous generations. Because of the sheer size of the camera island, there is no wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9EsYb89rXTRM3wvNpmuCGi" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-7.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EsYb89rXTRM3wvNpmuCGi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO continues to use curvy designs; the Find X7 Ultra has symmetric curves at the front and back, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable. The weight distribution is ideal, the leather back is a delight to hold, and the rounded edges and smooth curves means you get a great in-hand feel. At 221g, the phone isn&apos;t too heavy, and there&apos;s enough room on the sides to hold the device without any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nJyxPYUx3Siz8vePSntYei" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-9.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJyxPYUx3Siz8vePSntYei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there&apos;s the alert slider to the left. I like that the alert slider is now on OPPO phones as well; I use it extensively on OnePlus devices, so it&apos;s good to see more devices getting the hardware toggle. That said, the usage is different; while you can still toggle between ring and vibrate modes by moving the slider, the position at the top now toggles a VIP mode, which turns off mic, camera, and location access. That&apos;s just one of the dozens of ways the Chinese build of ColorOS is different to the global model, but I&apos;ll cover those in the software section below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NdiqJsU7vi9hwyHtVmDGrk" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-11.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdiqJsU7vi9hwyHtVmDGrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no titanium model of the Find X7 Ultra, but the phone uses an aluminum frame, and it feels just as premium as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Magic 6 Pro. And it gets IP68 ingress protection, giving it the same ability to withstand the elements as the best Android phones.</p><p>Overall, I like how OPPO iterated on the design of the Find X6 Pro to deliver what is the best-looking device of the year — it&apos;s a shame that the phone isn&apos;t available globally.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-display"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sm4NYuqz8xV47hvNcX7ub4" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-26.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sm4NYuqz8xV47hvNcX7ub4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra has a 6.82-inch AMOLED panel, and it goes up to 120Hz refresh. While that&apos;s all standard these days, what&apos;s unique about the device is how bright it is able to get: 1,600 nits in daily use, 2,600 nits in HBM mode, and 4,500 nits in HDR content. Like last year, there&apos;s a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 layer over the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zth6dWoxk9oCr3oAYp3Gsj" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-14.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zth6dWoxk9oCr3oAYp3Gsj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t see a noticeable difference between the phone and its rivals; if anything, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X100 Pro managed to get brighter in daily use. The Find X7 Ultra&apos;s differentiator is when viewing HDR content, and the phone holds up incredibly well in this regard.</p><p>Like most other high-end phones, the Find X7 Ultra gets LTPO tech, with the phone able to dynamically adjust refresh between 1Hz and 120Hz. You can manually adjust refresh between 60Hz and 120Hz, and the resolution can also be changed; it&apos;s set to FHD out of the box, but you can easily toggle QHD+ (3168 x 1440).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jiDz5iqcJChX4EMrAmJB44" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-15.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jiDz5iqcJChX4EMrAmJB44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant out of the box, and I had no issues in this area whatsoever. Contrast levels are similarly excellent, and you get a decent amount of configurability when it comes to adjusting the colors. In fact, the panel is identical to that of the OnePlus 12.</p>
<p>There&apos;s plenty of customizability when it comes to the always-on mode, and interestingly, you get a lot of extras that you don&apos;t see in the global ColorOS build. The in-screen reader is ideally positioned to use one-handed, and the bezels around the panel are thinner than last year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tfXDL4jcxhhC8tsKeCcM75" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-25.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tfXDL4jcxhhC8tsKeCcM75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most high-end phones have similar hardware, and there isn&apos;t much to differentiate devices in this regard. The Find X7 Ultra also uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and my unit has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. I didn&apos;t see any problems relating to the hardware, and outside of software quibbles, the phone was fluid throughout.</p>

<p>Just like the OnePlus 12, the Find X7 Ultra posts conservative figures in synthetic workloads; it suggests an aggressive thermal limit, and in 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the phone got a stability score of 57%, much less than what its rivals managed. The phone went up to 48 degrees Celsius, so even though it gets hot, you don&apos;t really see the resultant gains in extended use.</p>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t notice any lag while gaming — admittedly, I didn&apos;t play as many games on the phone, but in the few hour-long sessions I managed, I got stable framerates without any jitter. Also, there was no overheating in regular use.</p>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra has everything you need in terms of connectivity: there&apos;s Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, dual-band GPS, AptX HD codecs, LHDC, and a USB-C port that&apos;s based on the USB 3.2 standard. The vibration motor continues to be excellent, delivering granular feedback and extensive customizability.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-battery-life"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Battery life</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="APnvA5EX6aYJHbMkoRUVZk" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-19.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APnvA5EX6aYJHbMkoRUVZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X7 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery, and it has 100W charging tech, with a charger bundled in the box. The phone also has 50W wireless charging along with 10W reverse wireless charging, and honestly, I didn&apos;t bother with either. It takes just over 30 minutes to charge the battery, and in over a month of regular use, I didn&apos;t leave the Find X7 Ultra plugged in overnight even once — there&apos;s just no need to do so.</p><p>Anyway, battery life has been reliable throughout; I easily got over a day&apos;s worth of use consistently, and there is no battery anxiety whatsoever. The only point I&apos;ll note in this regard is that the battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Magic 6 Pro, and that&apos;s not astonishing considering Honor&apos;s phone has a larger 5600mAh unit. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra with the same 5000mAh battery manages to last longer, and it doesn&apos;t have memory management that&apos;s anywhere as aggressive.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-cameras"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o3aQoi7cfGvLUxvRhGwdcj" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-4.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3aQoi7cfGvLUxvRhGwdcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO always fielded decent cameras on its phones, but the Find X7 Ultra takes things to a whole new level. The phone has <em>four</em> 50MP cameras at the back — just like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — with a primary f/1.8 1-inch Sony LYT-900 module that&apos;s joined by an f/2.0 wide-angle lens based on Sony&apos;s LYT-600, an f/2.6 telephoto that uses the Sony IMX890 going up to 3x optical zoom, and a secondary f/4.3 telephoto based on the Sony IMX858 that hits 6x.</p>
<p>Outside of the wide-angle lens, all other cameras has dedicated OIS lenses. There&apos;s a 32MP camera at the front, and it does a decent job with selfies. The camera interface hasn&apos;t changed, and you get the same orange accents and leaf shutter sound that&apos;s standard on all phones with Hasselblad integration.</p>
<p>There&apos;s a new Master mode that has custom effects, and the Pro mode is bundled into this section. All four lenses can shoot 4K video at 60fps, and video recording in general is much better than previous models. Low-light videos in particular are terrific, and you get the ability to shoot in Dolby Vision with all the lenses, and it has better dynamic range throughout.</p>

<p>Photos taken with the main camera are outstanding. There is plenty of detail, vibrancy, and dynamic range, and you don&apos;t get any artifacting with foliage or clouds. The main camera also shoots at 2x, and shots are similarly detailed. But it&apos;s the telephoto shots that are noteworthy — the Find x7 Ultra produces standout shots at 3x and 6x, and you get usable shots up to 10x.</p>

<p>The phone holds its own in low-light scenarios, delivering shots with excellent detail, accurate colors, and minimal noise levels. The 3x and 6x lenses do a great job in challenging situations, and while the wide-angle lens isn&apos;t quite as good as the main camera, it is still better than what you get on most phones.</p>

<p>But it&apos;s the portrait shots that are truly outstanding; the phone automatically uses the 3x lens to take portraits, but you can use the 6x and the main camera as well. There&apos;s detailed background segmentation and good rendition of detail, and you can adjust the intensity of the background blur.</p><p>On the whole, the Find X7 Ultra is a fantastic package, and I prefer its color balance to that of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in a few scenarios. It outshines the Magic 6 Pro, and is in a different league altogether against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> — it is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a> available today. </p>

<p>The Find X7 Ultra runs ColorOS 14, and although it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, it is very different to the global build. As the phone is only available in China, there are a lot of unique features that you don&apos;t get in other regions, and honestly, setting up the phone the way I wanted was a challenge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JrDVuLPZriikyrqtXmuJ4" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-16.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrDVuLPZriikyrqtXmuJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Installing the Play Store was straightforward enough, but the Chinese ColorOS build does things very differently when it comes to permission management and notification access. So when I had to configure Google Pay, it wouldn&apos;t allow me to use SMS Organizer — my preferred SMS client — and would only send an SMS if the default Messages service was used.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4i8NZhMDu6WYeA354WnD9o" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-17.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4i8NZhMDu6WYeA354WnD9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After switching over, I had to then enter the password for my ColorOS account to send an authorization text; most Android phones do this behind the scenes, and having to enter a password to send a verification text is more restrictive than even iOS. Talking about restrictive features, using Bitwarden on the Find X7 Ultra continues to be an exercise in futility; even after enabling the autofill feature and giving the password manager the requisite access, the autofill service just wouldn&apos;t load, and every time, I had to go into the vault and manually grab the password.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J3U7xikpeLnqFJYWx2p6f3" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-20.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J3U7xikpeLnqFJYWx2p6f3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t have issues with notifications for the most part, but I had to manually whitelist apps and allow lock screen notifications to get push alerts, and memory management is more aggressive than the global build of ColorOS. I use DND mode throughout the day so as not to be bothered by notifications, but I whitelist all calls (I get a lot of packages). However, that didn&apos;t work in this instance, and whenever I set DND, calls would be silenced regardless of what I configured in the settings.</p>

<p>OPPO phones in the past had an annoying habit where they would use a hard-coded Google DNS configuration, so even if you use a custom DNS with your router (like I do), it wouldn&apos;t recognize that. Thankfully, that isn&apos;t the case on the Find X7 Ultra, but there were instances where it would randomly route to Google DNS intermittently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fK6EqWkFfdAhHHB9zB4Vyn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-18.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fK6EqWkFfdAhHHB9zB4Vyn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You don&apos;t get Google Assistant either, with the phone featuring the brand&apos;s Breeno assistant instead. The app drawer and notification pane are standard, but you don&apos;t get as many custom widgets. What&apos;s annoying is that there is much more bloatware pre-installed than on the global build, but it can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>What I like is just how many updates the phone has gotten over the last three months; I count at least four updates with stability tweaks, camera tuning enhancements, and feature additions that have made their way to the device, and you just don&apos;t get this level of frequency on the global ColorOS build.</p>
<p>On that note, the Find X7 Ultra will get four platform updates and five years of security updates, and going by the way it is picking up monthly updates, it should get the stable Android 15 well ahead of the global build.</p><p>That said, given the number of things to tweak, I wouldn&apos;t recommend buying the phone unless you&apos;ve used ColorOS extensively in the past and know how to get the most out of the interface. There are just too many changes to the global version, and it isn&apos;t worth the effort to tame the interface to your preferences.</p>

<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the closest rival to the Find X7 Ultra, with Xiaomi also offering a strong camera package with outstanding auxiliary lenses. There isn&apos;t much to differentiate either device in this area, and both phones deliver outstanding photos and videos in any scenario. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is available outside China, and you get the Play Store and a fluid interface that&apos;s considerably easier to use.</p><p>Honor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> is another device that nails the basics. It has a gorgeous design, the cameras hold their own against the Find X7 Ultra, and while I prefer OPPO&apos;s tuning, the Magic 6 Pro isn&apos;t far behind. And just like the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, you can buy the Magic 6 Pro outside China, although it isn&apos;t available in quite as many markets.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x7-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find X7 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want one of the best camera packages of 2024</li><li>You need a phone with a gorgeous design</li><li>You want a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED panel that gets bright</li><li>You need the best hardware available today</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need software that's easy to use</li><li>You want official warranty</li></ul>
<p>I used all the launches in the Find X series up to this point, and the Find X7 Ultra has significant upgrades across the board. The screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor, I love the two-tone design, and the leather texture combined with the frosted glass finish around the camera island gives the phone a level of refinement that you just don&apos;t get elsewhere.</p><p>And there&apos;s the camera island itself; the large housing is designed to grab attention, and the phone as a whole has a distinctive design and a comfortable in-hand feel. I have no problems when it comes to the hardware, and while a 1TB version would have been nice, it&apos;s not a huge omission. In a similar vein, the battery life has been reliable, and while the device doesn&apos;t last quite as long as its rivals, I still got over a day&apos;s worth of use easily.</p><p>But it&apos;s the cameras that are the star of the show; the quartet of 50MP cameras takes magnificent photos and videos, and the portrait shots in particular rivaled that of my mirrorless camera — and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement. It&apos;s because of the cameras that I stuck with the irritating software, and alongside the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the Find X7 Ultra is one of my favorite camera packages of 2024.</p><p>OPPO launched the Find X5 Pro globally, but it chose to limit the Find X6 Pro and the Find X7 Ultra to China. Thankfully, that policy is changing soon; upcoming Find phones will debut globally, and that&apos;s down to OPPO finally settling its lawsuit with Nokia. So even though the Find X7 Ultra isn&apos;t available outside China, there is reason to be excited.</p>

<hr>
<p>The US House of Representatives passed a bill that might lead to TikTok getting the boot in the country <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/house-passes-bill-could-ban-tiktok">unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a US company</a>.</p><p>On Saturday, the House voted 360-58 to push forward a bill that brings the possibility of banning TikTok in the US closer to reality, CBS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/possible-tiktok-ban-united-states-congress-house/" target="_blank">reports</a>. This bill had previously cleared the House in March but hit a roadblock in the Senate.</p><p>This time, the House bundled up a revamped version of the bill with a foreign aid package, which suggests it&apos;s now a bigger deal and could be tougher for the Senate to delay.</p><p>The TikTok ban is just one piece of a bigger bill dealing with sanctions on countries like Russia. It&apos;s tagged along with a bunch of other measures aimed at providing military support to Ukraine and Israel, plus humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p><p>TikTok previously said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the bill  infringes on free speech rights and would harm businesses and the US economy.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform…<a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1780777424109604894">April 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Since these funds are urgently needed, bundling TikTok with them means the Senate has to give it a quicker look than if it were on its own. In the earlier version, ByteDance had only six months to find a new owner. But after some back-and-forth talks, a compromise was reached, and now the revised bill heads to the Senate.</p><p>If it becomes law, ByteDance has a whole year to find a buyer. And you can bet the company will probably fight it in court, claiming it infringes on the First Amendment rights of TikTok&apos;s millions of users.</p><p>The push for this ban comes from both sides of the aisle in Congress, worrying about TikTok&apos;s ties to China. Some legislators are scared China might use the app to push propaganda to the US crowd. Plus, there&apos;s a lot of fretting about the heaps of data TikTok is scooping up on millions of American users.</p><p>However, critics of the bill have pointed out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">banning TikTok might not do much to safeguard Americans&apos; data after all</a>.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer mentioned that the Senate is hashing out the details for the next vote on the foreign aid package that includes the TikTok bill. President Joe Biden has already stated he&apos;s on board with the bill if Congress gives it the green light.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re like me, using a Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, or Apple iPhone has become increasingly difficult due to these phones&apos; use of flickering displays. The OLED panels that power these devices sure look nice, but unfortunately for us, our eyes and brains just don&apos;t like how they operate.</p><p>Thankfully, several options on the market offer a great experience without sacrificing processing power, camera quality, or overall experience. We&apos;re working to deliver the best guide for PWM/Flicker-sensitive people to make an informed buying decision and are aiming to include phones from every product category and price range.</p><p>I&apos;ve tested a lot of phones over the years and have been specifically testing phones for flicker sensitivity since originally posting about becoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM-sensitive</a> in mid-2023. Many of these phones are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and some, surprisingly, even use OLED displays. If you&apos;re extremely sensitive to flickering and PWM dimming, it&apos;s safe to say most phones with OLED displays are likely not in your future.</p><p>Some upcoming phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/embargo-226-2-am-et-tcls-50-series-phones-will-debut-in-north-america-starting-q2-2024">TCL 50 series</a> sport "paperlike" LCD displays that use no PWM according <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/NJBf31yQFao?si=mLdpBbiNTrWphvXl">to my brief testing</a> at MWC 2024. Look forward to those if you need an LCD-based upgrade this year.</p><p>People who are sensitive to display flicker aren&apos;t all sensitive to the same problems, so what works for one person may not work for another. I&apos;ve included as much information as I can on each phone to help you make the best decision.</p>

<p>Motorola has taken a massive turn for the better in 2023, and part of that is thanks to its excellent displays. The pOLED in the Motorola Edge+ (2023) is super eye-friendly, particularly with Motorola's flicker-reduction setting enabled.</p>

<p>Motorola took us by surprise this year when it released the Motorola Edge Plus (2023). Motorola&apos;s premium phones had been struggling in recent years so it was refreshing to see Motorola not only release a phone with such stellar hardware but also back that hardware up with a four-year software update promise and a PWM-friendly OLED display.</p><p>Motorola sells this model as the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) in the U.S. and as the Motorola Edge 40 Pro in most of the rest of the world. It&apos;s also sold in China as the Moto X40.</p><p>Motorola debuted a relatively new flicker-reduction option with the Edge Plus (2023) that ensures the phone&apos;s display is on 99.51% of the time during the duty cycle. In practice, this is identical to DC dimming, which means the phone is actually reducing the voltage to the OLED diodes instead of using PWM flickering to fake a dimmer display.</p>

<p>As is telling from light flicker measurements, the brightness dips a little bit each time the display refreshes. In this case, the display is refreshing at around 120Hz. This is normal for all DC-dimmed OLED displays.</p><p>As long as the flicker reduction feature is enabled, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) never switches to PWM dimming, even at the lowest brightness settings. Because of this, you might notice some display noise that looks a bit like an old 35mm movie. That&apos;s because OLED diodes have difficulty showing consistent brightness levels and color when voltage is reduced.</p><p>The upside is that the display doesn&apos;t flicker or use PWM to manage these negative factors, meaning it&apos;s a lot more comfortable to look at.</p><p>If you disable the flicker reduction feature, you&apos;ll see that 720Hz PWM dimming is used below 35% brightness. Check out the video below to see it in action.</p>

<p>This is my personal favorite premium phone and I have no comfort issues from using this phone all day long.</p><p>Aside from just having a comfortable display, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is a downright amazing phone. It&apos;s got a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, plus 2-day battery life and those timeless Motorola features that make using Motorola phones so convenient.</p><p>The camera could be better but it&apos;s surprised me more than a few times. Just make sure you stick to 1080p video recording quality if you want to use all the best camera features the phone has to offer.</p>

<p>The Xiaomi 13 is a community pick and the one that best fits in the category of best international premium phone. We&apos;ve had the pleasure of reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi 13 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-pro-review">Xiaomi 13 Pro</a>, and Android Central&apos;s Harish Jonnalagadda also has the regular Xiaomi 13 as well, so we&apos;re familiar with the software and overall phone experience.</p><p>But the smaller (and less expensive) Xiaomi 13 is the one to pick for PWM-sensitive folks. Out of the box, it utilizes a 1,920Hz PWM OLED display, but you can enable DC dimming by selecting the "anti-flicker" setting in the display options.</p><p>Graphs from the same Opple Light Master light meter I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yourphonehurts.com/xiaomi-13/">can be found here</a>, and you can see the difference between the two modes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P44y1U7tj/">in this video</a>.</p><p>Aside from a vision-friendly display, you&apos;re getting a cutting-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, great battery life, and faster charging than anything offered by Google, Apple, or Samsung.</p><p>It&apos;s also got a great camera — even if it&apos;s not as good as the Xiaomi 13 Pro or Ultra models — and MIUI is always feature-packed and updated regularly.</p><p>The phone is clearly styled after the iPhone with its shiny, flat sides. This is something that people will either love or hate, as is evidenced by the constant design changes back and forth over the years. MIUI is also extremely Apple "inspired" and has always been a sort of iOS clone since its inception.</p>

<p>If camera performance is the most important part of a smartphone for you, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s camera</a> will seriously blow you away. Not only are everyday shots from the 50MP main camera and 180MP telephoto camera incredible, but the phone&apos;s software is smart enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">take pictures for you</a>.</p><p>But before we get into all that, let&apos;s go over the display because this is one <em>weird</em> OLED panel. First off, it&apos;s capable of emitting an eye-searing 5,000 nits of brightness at its peak, something it regularly staves from by utilizing DC-like dimming to keep the eye pain at bay.</p><p>But the weird thing is that Honor uses a 360Hz backplane for its DC-like dimming structure, which means it might feel more like 360Hz PWM dimming to some people.</p>

<p>At 100% brightness, the display uses a moderate 17% modulation rate which is 3x deeper than the Motorola Edge Plus 2023 at the same brightness. It&apos;s nowhere near phones like the Galaxy S23 Ultra or Google Pixel Fold with their 99% modulation rate at full brightness, but it&apos;s not quite as good a some others on this list.</p><p>But when you drop the display to 30% brightness and below, something very odd happens. The 4,320Hz PWM rate kicks in below 30% brightness but it&apos;s interwoven with the same 360Hz DC-like dimming method from higher brightness levels.</p><p>The effect is so strange that my Opple Light Master IV can&apos;t pick it up at all and reads it as 360Hz all the way to 0% brightness. Despite what my measurement instrument is telling me, a high speed camera shutter proves that the phone does use 4,320Hz PWM dimming below 30% brightess.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QUgEftJtMQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>For me, this display was super comfortable from the moment I started using it. Thus far, this has been my main phone since I began using it in early February 2024 and I have yet to feel any discomfort form the display.</p><p>In fact, this is one of the few phones I&apos;ve been able to use with auto brightness enabled. The consistency that the 360Hz frequency delivers is likely the reason for this as it helps emulate a sine wave pattern similar to an incandescent bulb.</p><p>Beyond the display, I&apos;ve mostly enjoyed using the phone and heartily recommend it over past Honor phones. While Magic OS is still very iOS-heavy in its design, Magic OS 8.0 overhauled the UI and fixed a lot of problems I had with previous Honor Magic OS releases. It no longer feels clunky and outdated, even if I don&apos;t care for the iOS style split notification panels and some other UI elements.</p><p>I&apos;ve had my fair share of quirks along the way though, including a sometimes unresponsive app drawer and the occasional notification that&apos;ll get missed. If you pick one up, make sure you disable all the nonsense power saving "features" that are enabled by default and enable notifications on all apps. Otherwise, you&apos;ll end up missing a lot.</p><p>The phone sports some seriously incredible performance and battery life even when you disable the silly power saving features, though. Honor is using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">new type of battery</a> with the phone and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor soars through every test imaginable. It&apos;s a bit win overall, despite the quirks.</p>

<p>The worst part about being a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">folding phones</a> is when you&apos;re also someone who&apos;s sensitive to display flicker. Most folding phones use Samsung AMOLED panels, and, as a result, most of them flicker <em>a lot</em>. Motorola uses pOLED panels by LG, and these allow for proper DC dimming at high brightness levels.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s flicker reduction option in display settings further helps keep things under control, but that doesn&apos;t mean this phone will work for everyone who is flicker-sensitive.</p><p>As you can see from the charts below, the phone uses refresh rate-locked DC dimming for the OLED panel, meaning there&apos;s a slight dip in brightness every time the screen refreshes. Dropping the refresh rate to 60Hz may make this phone more comfortable for some folks since the dips happen less often.</p>

<p>But, even with DC dimming enabled, the modulation rate is a bit higher than what&apos;s comfortable for some flicker-sensitive folks. For me, anything below an 8% modulation rate is usually the most comfortable.</p><p>Other flicker-sensitive folks might find this display is still comfortable, though, since it doesn&apos;t use PWM dimming above 25% brightness. Extra dim is supported on this panel, but it triples the modulation rate, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend using it.</p>

<p>The video confirms that modulation is low throughout most brightness levels. You can see the difference between the flickering levels with the flicker reduction setting enabled and disabled here, too.</p><p>The phone&apos;s cover display modulates at the exact same rate as the large folding display, so using that more often won&apos;t change much.</p><p>If you&apos;re comfortable with these numbers, Motorola&apos;s flip phone is one of our favorite flip phones of all time. While it doesn&apos;t have as many software features as Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip series, Motorola&apos;s cover display is <em>much</em> more useful than the Galaxy Z Flip 5&apos;s because Motorola lets you do <strong>anything</strong> with it. It&apos;s all here, from running full apps, swiping through widgets, or even playing games without having to flip open the phone.</p><p>It uses an older Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor which still feels snappy despite being a few years old now. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t mean battery life is particularly good — something that plagues all flip phones. Thankfully, Motorola&apos;s chargers are quicker than Samsung&apos;s, and you can top up in just a few minutes without worry.</p>

<p>If you know anything about Nothing&apos;s phones, you&apos;ll know the company takes its design language seriously. The company&apos;s first budget-friendly option, the Nothing Phone 2a, delivers a superb mid-range experience without compromising on design. It&apos;s still got the glyph interface lights on the back, and the company&apos;s trademark transparent design language looks as good as ever.</p><p>More impressively, the company kept an OLED display onboard that uses DC-like dimming above 50% brightness and 2,160Hz PWM dimming below 50% brightness. While the refresh frequency is more aligned to the refresh rate than the Nothing Phone 2, the Phone 2a&apos;s modulation rate is a bit higher.</p><p>You can see this effect in the video below. The Phone 2a has a darker single line at high brightness while the Nothing Phone 2 has double lines that are dimmer. The means the Nothing Phone 2 pulses at a higher rate, which could be less comfortable with DC-like dimming, but the brightness dip at the end of the duty cycle isn&apos;t quite as stark as it is on the Phone 2a.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this means the Phone 2 will be more comfortable for some people while the 2a might be more comfortable for other folks. It all depends on what bothers your eyes more.</p><p>I found the Nothing Phone 2a was most comfortable at 49% brightness, as the higher PWM rate actually felt great to use. That makes it a little harder to see outside in the sun, but it&apos;s about as bright as your average budget LCD phone at this level, so it&apos;s not too bad.</p><p>In fact, one of the reasons I think this brightness level was so comfortable for me is because the graph, seen below, looks very similar to what a good LCD display looks like. The line is quite flat despite using PWM, and that made it feel gentler on my eyes.</p>

<p>Coming from the Honor 90, which was our previous pick for this category, the Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s Nothing OS is a breath of fresh air. While Honor tends to stick closely to iOS-style design, Nothing OS feels a lot more like classic Oxygen OS used to.</p><p>It&apos;s got a super light and fast feel while retaining a unique visual look. The company&apos;s dot matrix-style font stands out, and the home screen customization settings will help immediately differentiate your phone from everyone else&apos;s — as if the transparent back and LED glyph interface on the back doesn&apos;t already do that!</p><p>Plus, I really enjoyed the build of this phone. Sure, it&apos;s completely made of polycarbonate with an aluminum frame for support, but the company made the edges with a sandpaper-like texture. That makes it very easy to grip and pick up from a table, plus the centered camera island means it won&apos;t wobble when you place it down like so many other phones do.</p>

<p>OnePlus has long been a company focused on delivering value, and the Nord series fulfills its diehard customers&apos; expectations of that idea. The Nord N30 is the 2023 U.S. Nord release, and it brings the usual suite of improvements along with one surprising change: the 60Hz OLED display on the N20 was swapped out for a 120Hz LCD panel on the N30.</p><p>That LCD panel is super friendly for anyone suffering from flicker sensitivity as it uses proper DC dimming at an extremely high frequency — greater than 15,000Hz, in fact — to get things done.</p>

<p>This display is mostly flicker-free at all brightness levels, as evidenced by the video below. However, there seems to be a slight flicker below 10% brightness that doesn&apos;t get picked up in the video.</p><p>Some users in the PWM-sensitive community have picked up the phone and found that it does bother them at very low brightness levels like this, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend using it at super low brightness.</p>

<p>Aside from the flicker-free display at most brightness levels, the Nord N30 is a fantastic budget phone that&apos;s littered with features thanks to OxygenOS. This is the same OxygenOS you&apos;ll find on more expensive OnePlus phones, so you&apos;re getting the best features at a bargain price.</p><p>And the processor in this phone is fast enough even for graphics-intensive games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/the-division-resurgence-brings-console-quality-gaming-to-phones">The Division Resurgence</a> thanks to fast internal storage speed and general improvements in optimization in OxygenOS over the years. Plus, battery life is truly excellent, and it charges in about 30 minutes flat with the included charger.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re PWM or flicker-sensitive, it can be extremely difficult to figure out which phones work best for you. As a rule of thumb, IPS LCD panels are usually friendlier on the eyes than any kind of OLED panel, but even that&apos;s not guaranteed. PWM dimming is sometimes used for cost reasons, while it&apos;s used to mask poor low light screen quality in other instances, so even LCD panels can use it.</p><p>OLED displays have to use PWM dimming at a certain brightness level to retain accurate colors and details. You can read about why that&apos;s the case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">in detail here</a>. But know that most OLED displays <em>can</em> use DC dimming to maintain brightness at high levels. Some manufacturers — like Samsung, Google, and Apple — just refuse to do this.</p><p>While the phones on this list have been tested and used by us, everyone&apos;s eyes and brains work a little differently. That means what works for one person won&apos;t always work for another person. If you&apos;re PWM-sensitive, there&apos;s a high likelihood that you may have to try several options on the list before you find something that&apos;s comfortable for you.</p><p>If you find your phone bothers your eyes when using automatic brightness, try setting it to manual at 100% brightness. Then use an app like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.ericytsang.screenfilter.app.android">screen and notification dimmer</a> to artificially lower the brightness. I&apos;ve tested a lot of screen-dimming apps, and this is the best one.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>What phone works for one person may not work for another person, especially if you have sensitive eyes.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Folks looking for a premium phone in the U.S. should look no further than the Motorola Edge+ (2023). Motorola uses a special flicker reduction DC dimming method that ensures the screen&apos;s duty cycle remains on 99.51% of the time.</p><p>In simple terms, that means the screen isn&apos;t flickering like other OLED displays no matter the brightness level. Just make sure you enable "flicker reduction" in the phone&apos;s display settings. The Motorola Razr Plus uses a similar method of flicker reduction, making it the only foldable phone available in the U.S. that&apos;s vision-friendly.</p><p>Internationally, there are a lot more options. Many smartphones from Asia offer DC dimming methods, including the Xiaomi 13, Honor Magic 6 Pro, and several other options. More and more companies have begun to increase their display PWM rates and have been better about clearly marking the rate in the phone&apos;s marketing.</p>

<p>Samsung habitually launches refurbished Galaxy phones, especially premium ones, in the U.S. market. After the Galaxy S22 and S21 series received the refurbished treatment, the flagship Galaxy S23 series is now being launched in the country under the company&apos;s Certified Re-newed program, just in time for Earth Day.</p><p>While the company has seen a successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series launch early this year, the company is bringing its predecessors in a new avatar under its CRN program, which involves the trio of devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-review">S23 Plus</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">S23 Ultra</a>. All phones go through extensive testing, receive genuine parts, and are further assembled by Samsung engineers, the company notes in a shared press release.</p>

<p>Like the current Galaxy S24 series, the new refurbished S23 series will also carry Samsung&apos;s one-year warranty alongside the latest announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search with Google</a> and Live Translate — thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> shipping out of the box.</p><p>This means you get access to premium, like-new phones and the latest features for much less than you normally would. This should appeal to individuals who may be put off by the idea of spending more than $1000 on a Samsung flagship phone, especially those considering purchasing from a third party.</p>

While it may look outdated now compared to the Quest 3 and Pro, the upgraded refresh rate provided a 25% improvement over the original Oculus Quest at launch, delivering a smoother, much more immersive VR experience. </p><p>Meta Quest 2 runs supported games at 90Hz and even some at 120Hz natively, but if you&apos;re connecting to a PC with Oculus Link you may still need to adjust some settings to get the best experience.</p>
<h2 id="quest-games-with-120hz-support-2">Quest games with 120Hz support</h2>
<p>A few years ago, Meta updated the Quest 2 with an experimental 120Hz mode. The Quest 2 still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/november-quest-2-update-adds-90hz-app-gifting-oculus-move-and-more">automatically switches</a> the display to 90Hz mode when a game supports it, but you&apos;ll need to go into your Quest 2&apos;s settings to enable a 120Hz refresh rate. Since there aren&apos;t a ton of games that have full 120Hz support, many games will still cap at 90Hz. </p><p>That said, players won&apos;t have to modify their Quest 2 in order to play their Oculus Quest games at higher frame rates anymore. The caveat here is that developers need to update their games in order to support 90 or 120Hz on the Quest 2, otherwise they&apos;ll run at 72Hz like the original Oculus Quest did.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-120hz-on-quest-2-2">How to enable 120Hz on Quest 2</h2>
<p>The Quest 2&apos;s offered support for 120Hz refresh rates for some time now, but for the time being, they&apos;re tucked away with other experimental features on the Quest 2.  Before you enable 120Hz though, it&apos;s important to note that the 120Hz refresh rate on Quest 2 is still considered an experimental feature, so it can affect your Quest 2&apos;s battery life, temperature, and other performance-related specifications. To <strong>enable 120Hz on your Quest 2</strong>...</p>
<ul><li>Open your Quest 2's <strong>Settings App</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom of the Settings App, you'll find a widget labeled "<strong>Experimental</strong>."</li><li><strong>Enable 120Hz </strong>will be the first setting you can toggle below he "Reset Experimental Features" option.</li></ul>

<h2 id="how-to-enable-higher-framerates-with-oculus-link-2">How to enable higher framerates with Oculus Link</h2>
<p>When you connect your Meta Quest 2 to a gaming PC with a Link cable, you&apos;ll be able to play PC VR games using Rift software. The $80 Oculus cable is officially recommended by Meta to provide the highest-quality experience. You can save money by opting for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-link-cable-alternative-oculus-quest-2" target="_blank">great Link cable alternatives</a>, as well.</p>
<p>1. If you don&apos;t already have it,<strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwn7mwBhCiARIsAGoxjaK_bzn4AohK6RKuvQOBy1hiMNj9oB3Oycijgmv7OXMa3ll9CZMdyfMaAs99EALw_wcB"><strong>download the Link software here</strong></a>.</p><p>2. <strong>Sign in with your Oculus account</strong>.</p><p>3. Connect one side of the USB cable to a <strong>USB port on your PC</strong> and the other side to your <strong>Oculus Quest 2</strong>.</p><p>4. The Oculus app on your computer should recognize the Oculus Quest once it&apos;s plugged in. Click <strong>Continue </strong>on the screen that pops up to enable Oculus Link.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9" name="oculus-link-rift-software-1.jpg" alt="Oculus Link Rift Software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdar5ugqvpv9TkFNYvkXk9.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="0" height="0" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. During the setup, you can test the cable to make sure it&apos;s fast enough to be used with Oculus Link by clicking the <strong>Test </strong>button at the bottom of the screen. If your cable fails the test, you should consider one of the cables we recommend above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dNcWTBmVQv9G8qhSiuYWe6" name="oculus_link_cable_failed.jpg" alt="Speed test failed for the Quest 2 USB Link Cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNcWTBmVQv9G8qhSiuYWe6.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxVUvMH3r32hHqAePgj2f.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Charlie Wacholz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6. Click <strong>Continue </strong>and put the Meta Quest on your head.</p><p>7. If asked to <em>Allow access to data</em>, select <strong>Deny</strong>.</p><p>8. Select <strong>Enable Oculus Link</strong> on the next pop-up that appears.</p>
<p>Now that you&apos;ve got your Quest 2 connected and set up, it&apos;s time to head to advanced options to make sure you&apos;re running at 90Hz.</p>
<p>9. With the Oculus software open on your PC, select <strong>Devices </strong>from the menu on the left.</p><p>10. In your list of devices, click on <strong>Quest 2 and Touch</strong> to open device options.</p><p>11. Scroll down to Graphics Preferences and click it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u6eUUu7rFejp8KQRErrY9T" name="graphics-preferences-quest-2-link.jpg" alt="Changing the graphics settings on the Quest 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u6eUUu7rFejp8KQRErrY9T.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqHrBBxcMMw5dEPtjTBS8D.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>12. Select <strong>your desired framerate</strong> from the range of refresh rate options.</p><p>13. Click <strong>Save & Restart</strong> to restart the Oculus software.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-in-frame-rates-is-a-big-upgrade-2">The difference in frame rates is a big upgrade</h2>
<p>Frame rates like 120, or even 90Hz are a huge upgrade for loads of VR games, even if the number jump from 72Hz to 90Hz doesn&apos;t seem like a lot. Every increase in refresh rate with a VR headset means a more comfortable experience, less motion sickness, and a more realistic feeling.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Wear OS has changed quite a bit over the past few years, thanks to Google&apos;s renewed focus on the wearable platform. That focus has resulted in much better apps coming to the platform, with YouTube Music being among them. After launching on the Galaxy Watch series in 2021, YouTube Music has been a staple as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">best music streaming apps</a> on the platform.</p><p>However, using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> on your smartwatch is a bit different from using it on an Android phone. So, we&apos;ll go over the ins and outs of how to use YouTube Music on your Wear OS watch, so you can enjoy your tunes without pulling out your phone.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-youtube-music-on-wear-os-2">Getting started with YouTube Music on Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-app.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kufxphEuKxyDsosc99yqwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you download YouTube Music from the Play Store on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, you&apos;ll automatically be logged in to your Google Account. However, it&apos;s easy to switch accounts if you find yourself logged into a different account. This is important if you want to keep the same playlists, likes, and recommendations from your primary YouTube Music account. You can skip the following steps if you&apos;re already logged into your preferred account.</p>
<p>1. Scroll down and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Switch account</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Tap the account</strong> you want to switch to or select <strong>Manage accounts</strong> to log into another account from your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="ZkwNTstmSEz2cdGVzWjrtR" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-switch-accounts.jpg" alt="Swithcing YouTube Music account on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZkwNTstmSEz2cdGVzWjrtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you open YouTube Music, you&apos;ll be directed to the home screen, which consists of a few sections and options:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Downloads</strong>: This is where all your pending downloads and downloaded content will appear. We will go over how to download music in the following section.</li><li><strong>Workout</strong>: This section includes various workout mixes created by YouTube Music based on your listening habits.</li><li><strong>Recommendations</strong>: This is where you find your Liked songs as well as various playlists, albums, and more than you have listened to or may be interested in listening to based on your habits.</li><li><strong>Library</strong>: This is where you access your Settings and content saved in your library.</li></ul>
<p>You cannot search for music in the YouTube Music Wear OS app like you can on a smartphone. The wearable app is primarily for listening to music in your library or recommended content/mixes. That said, you can select an album, playlist, or podcast to scroll through and play individual songs/episodes, or you can simply hit the Shuffle button found at the top of an album or playlist.</p><p>The best part is that you don&apos;t need to download music to listen to, as in the early days of the Wear OS app. You just have to have an active Wi-Fi or LTE connection, which will allow you to stream content.</p><p>That said, downloading music to your watch has benefits, which we&apos;ll discuss in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-music-on-your-wear-os-watch-2">How to download music on your Wear OS watch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DKeh7PREAMeHZvpUqURLLN" name="YouTube-Music-Wear-OS-recommendations.jpg" alt="YouTube Music app recommendations on Wear OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DKeh7PREAMeHZvpUqURLLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not necessarily the case with LTE smartwatches, Wi-Fi smartwatches don&apos;t always have a connection available, especially if you&apos;re out and about. That&apos;s one main reason why you should download music for offline listening, something that&apos;s only available if you are subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. Downloading content is also good for preserving battery life as opposed to streaming songs on the go.</p><p>Doing so is pretty easy:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Select</strong> a playlist, album, or podcast. You can alternatively <strong>press and hold</strong> any individual song.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>download icon</strong>, and your download should begin.</p><p>3. YouTube Music will let you download albums or playlists. However, podcasts have to be downloaded by the episode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="6sSK2V4vVHjTrRQnEYwyPS" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-download-content.jpg" alt="Downloading content on the YouTube Music Wear OS app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6sSK2V4vVHjTrRQnEYwyPS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also enable Smart Downloads, which will automatically download additional music to your smartwatch that it thinks you&apos;ll like based on your listening habits. Keep in mind, this will take up more storage space on your smartwatch, so you may need to keep an eye on that.</p>
<p>1. Tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Downloads</strong>.</p><p>3. <strong>Select from the available amounts</strong> to indicate how many songs you want the app to download: 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500.</p><p>4. <strong>Confirm</strong> the amount. The Downloads menu will always present your option and your available storage space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="9Y9NyVbrGwGDGqFH2MJfZS" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-smart-downloads.jpg" alt="Smart downloads on the YouTube Music Wear OS app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Y9NyVbrGwGDGqFH2MJfZS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, you can turn off Smart Downloads, which may be useful if you need to save space. Additionally, you can clear your downloads at the very bottom of the menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.33%;"><img id="EPpULhjZYHftUxBHo3zLjS" name="Youtube-Music-Wear-OS-download-options.jpg" alt="Download options on the YouTube Music Wear OS app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EPpULhjZYHftUxBHo3zLjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1350" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you have an LTE smartwatch, you have the option to allow downloads using your cellular connection or just from Wi-Fi, which may be useful if you have data limitations. To do so, go to <strong>Settings > Downloads > Download over Wi-Fi only</strong>, then toggle the option on or off, based on your preference.</p>

<p>As mentioned, you have a few options when listening to music on the app. You can browse through your library, select from a mix, or choose from your recommended content. You can also listen offline or stream using your Wi-Fi/LTE connection.</p><p>That said, you must be connected to wireless earbuds, as there&apos;s no option to listen to music through your watch speaker. The watch should direct you to connect to wireless earbuds if you already aren&apos;t, but just in case, we can walk you through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pair-bluetooth-headphones-pixel-watch">how to connect Bluetooth headphones to your Pixel Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-pair-bluetooth-headphones-galaxy-watch">pair headphones to a Galaxy Watch</a>.</p>

<p>When a track is playing, you will be directed to the Now Playing screen, which sits to the right of the home screen and is always a swipe away, regardless of whether or not anything is actually playing. You have options to play and pause content, rewind and fast forward (for podcasts), and skip or go back (music). You&apos;ll also find a like button and a volume button, which lets you tap the display to adjust volume (you can also ignore this button and use the crown for watches that have one or the bezel for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch models</a>).</p>
<h2 id="get-up-and-go-with-youtube-music-on-wear-os-2">Get up and go with YouTube Music on Wear OS</h2>
<p>Now you know the basics of using YouTube Music on your smartwatch. There are a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">excellent Android watches</a> out there, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, so we&apos;re glad to see that the app is making its way to more options. YouTube Music is continuing to grow as a streaming service. Hopefully, the app will evolve, too, so that more and more people can experience their favorite tunes through whatever smart device they choose.</p>

<ul><li>Android 14 QPR1 Beta 2 introduced a new feature to enable better syncing between phones and smartwatch apps.</li><li>Mishaal Rahman spotted the new addition, which lets users "Sync permissions from phone."</li><li>It is a new toggle that should extend app permissions from Android phones to Wear OS smartwatches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel Watch app for Android has been spotted with a new app permission feature that should make using apps on your smartwatch and Android phone more seamless.</p><p>First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/MishaalAndroidNews/1100">Mishaal Rahman</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/app-permission-syncing-galaxy-watch-android-phone-coming-soon/">SamMobile</a>), a new sync permissions feature allows users to sync their app permissions between their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and connected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a>. While the feature doesn&apos;t operate now, it gives us an idea of what to expect from future updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.42%;"><img id="7sdpmQhX9PAQAxYzwhErp4" name="Pixel-watch-app-permission.jpeg" alt="New Pixel Watch app permission" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sdpmQhX9PAQAxYzwhErp4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android phone users will be able to navigate to their System preferences and hit the Device details section, where they&apos;ll spot the new "Sync permissions from phone" toggle. Enabling it would "Give your watch the same app permissions" that users have allowed on the respective handset. As mentioned, it is currently in the works and can only be enabled by a flag first spotted in Android 14 QPR1 Beta 2.</p><p>Whenever the feature rollout happens, it should help Android phone and Wear OS users save time dealing with the app permissions on both devices.</p>
<p>As SamMobile puts it, whenever a user grants permission to access their location on Google Maps, the same app permission will extend to their smartwatch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>, for the respective Google Maps app. What&apos;s more is that this feature won&apos;t be exclusive to Pixels so other Android phones and Wear OS smartwatches will be able to take advantage.</p><p>That said, your smartwatch may need to run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, which is only available on a handful of models. Aside from the Pixel Watch and Galaxy Watch models, Wear OS 4 is available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and may soon come to the TicWatch Pro 5, assuming Mobvoi&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">beta test</a> goes well.</p>

<ul><li>Google rolled out new ways to filter your search in the Google Drive app for iOS last month, and at the time, said the features would come to Android at a later date.</li><li>Now, it appears that the search filters are starting to appear in the Google Drive app for Android after a recent update.</li><li>The filter categories can be found right below the in-app search bar and include things like File Type, Owner, and Last Modified.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Drive app for Android is getting a much-needed update to make finding the exact file you&apos;re looking for easier. Google is adding a collection of search filters to the Drive app directly under the main app search bar, just like it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-video-playback-speed-boost">added to the iOS version of the app</a> early last Month. When the company announced the change, it said Android users would eventually get search filters as well but did not elaborate further.</p><p>Now, it looks like Google is pushing the update that includes search filters in Google Drive to Android users, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-new-search-filters-on-android/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> spotted. It comes a bit over a month after Google brought the feature to iOS, which is something the company occasionally does despite being Android&apos;s developer.</p><p>Search filters are nothing new to Google Drive, but these ones on the Android app are smarter than usual. When searching for a file in Drive, the filtering options will move around based on the contents of your search. Essentially, Google hopes to put the needed search filter directly under the search bar right when you need it without having to make users scroll to find the one that&apos;ll help.</p><p>You can take a look at how search filters work in the Google Drive app for Android in the screenshots below, which Google shared when it first made the feature available on iOS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:788px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.18%;"><img id="riLqdt7o8doyMYQHokDUh9" name="google-drive-search-filters.jpg" alt="new search filters in google drive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/riLqdt7o8doyMYQHokDUh9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="788" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The search filters include options like File Type, Owners, and Last Modified. They come in handy in several situations, like if you only want to search images or documents. You can also see only files that were modified recently via set time intervals you can choose between. You can also search only files owned by a specific person, which is neat, too.</p><p>Again, search filters are hardly a new thing, but Google is making the Drive app for Android more like the desktop versions with this change. As phones get bigger and more powerful, there&apos;s a higher chance people will try to do more work on the go with their smartphones. With features like these — and the emergence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">great folding phones</a> — that kind of usage becomes more of a possibility for everyday people.</p><p>We&apos;ve spotted search filters appearing in the Google Drive app on a few of our devices. If you&apos;re not seeing the update, try updating the Drive app manually in the Google Play Store app. Google says this feature is available with all Google accounts, including personal and Workspace accounts.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be adding an Android 15 feature that will give you a better idea of the health of your phone's storage chip. </li><li>While flash storage is generally considered to be extremely reliable, it can fail just like other smartphone components, and this feature will try and gauge how much life is left in a phone's storage chip.</li><li>The upcoming functionality will work similar to battery health on Android, showing the health of a storage chip in the form of a percentage.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Flash storage is much more reliable than other types of storage, and it doesn&apos;t contain moving parts like hard drives do. However, it isn&apos;t completely failproof either, and that&apos;s why Google wants to show the remaining life of your phone&apos;s storage chip in Android 15. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-storage-health-3435507/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> uncovered, Google plans to show your the health of phone&apos;s storage chip with a percentage in the next version of Android.</p><p>Android Authority notes that information related to storage can be found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-run-diagnostics-on-your-pixel">Device Diagnostics</a> app. Additionally, more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">information about your phone&apos;s battery</a> will be shown in Device Diagnostics as well. The storage health functionality is powered by a new API that "returns the remaining lifetime of the internal storage device, as an integer percentage." </p><p>So, a reading of 80 from the API would mean that only 80% of the chip&apos;s expected lifespan remains. It&apos;s unclear exactly how Android determines the health of a phone&apos;s storage chip; however, there are a handful of storage attributes that can be signs of a failing or degrading flash chip. </p><p>High temperatures can accelerate flash chip degradation, which is a concern on smartphones. There are plenty of ways that a smartphone is exposed to extreme temperatures, including wired charging, wireless charging, prolonged use, and extended periods of time in the sun. As such, the lifespan of a smartphone&apos;s flash chip is more important to monitor than, say, an SSD in a computer.</p><p>The remaining lifespan of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> will be most accurate on Pixel phones, which report a percentage down to one percent accuracies. However, other Android phones merely provide percentages at 10% intervals. Some Android devices will lack the reporting functionality entirely and will be unable to show the percent of a phone chip&apos;s usable lifetime remaining.</p><p>We&apos;ll learn more about this feature in future Android 15 releases since Google&apos;s patch notes say it is "intended to be displayed to users" rather than for internal use. </p>

<hr>
<p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-markup-feature">adding annotation support to Google Docs</a> earlier this year, Google Meet users can now make annotations and collaborate with others while presenting. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/04/Annotations-Google-Meet.html" target="_blank">announced</a> the changes last week, and they&apos;re now starting to roll out to users of select Google Workspace tiers. With annotation, it&apos;s easy to highlight, draw, or add text to presented content from screen shares to file or webpage shares.</p><p>Annotations will be turned on by default when you start presenting content in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a>. There&apos;s a new menu that can be found in the bottom righthand corner of the share preview that houses all of the settings an options related to annotations. Alternatively, there is an annotation button in the top left corner of the presentation toolbar in Google Meet as well.</p><p>This menu includes stickers, a disappearing ink tool, a pen tool, a highlighter tool, text boxes, sticky notes, lines and shapes, and a color picker. Additionally, there is a <strong>Clear all</strong> option as well as an eraser tool. When you&apos;re finished annotating, there is a <strong>Stop annotating</strong> button in this menu too. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ekaJyHic3X6DW9Q9YD67PY" name="Google-Meet-Annotate-2.jpg" alt="Annotation menu in Google Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekaJyHic3X6DW9Q9YD67PY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other meeting participants can be added as co-annotators, and this is helpful so the presenter can talk while a helper annotates. It also might be conducive to collaboration, with more people being able to participate. </p><p>However, annotations in Google Meet aren&apos;t available for everyone. You&apos;ll need a specific Google Workspace account to enjoy them, and the following Workspace tiers are included:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Business </strong>Starter, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>Enterprise</strong> Starter, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>Frontline </strong>Starter and Standard</li><li><strong>Essentials</strong>, Enterprise Essentials, and Enterprise Essentials Plus</li><li><strong>Education</strong> Standard, Plus, the Teaching & Learning Upgrade</li><li><strong>Workspace Individual </strong>subscribers</li></ul>
<p>iOS users also miss out on annotations while presenting, even if they are Google Workspace subscribers, although they can make annotations as co-annotators. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android users</a> can make annotations in Google Meet, co-annotating is unsupported at the time. Google says the functionality will come in a subsequent update. </p><p>For now, eligible Google Workspace users on a rapid release schedule started seeing the update on April 18, but it could take up to 15 days after that date for everyone to get the feature.
