"Flagship killer" phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> are popular for a reason, and the $229 OnePlus Watch 2R targets popular Android watches in the same fashion.</p><p>OnePlus stuck closely to the OnePlus Watch 2 template with the Watch 2R: You get the same 1.43-inch display, Snapdragon chip, RAM, storage, battery capacity, speedy VOOC charging, and Wear OS 4 software with OnePlus&apos; unique RTOS software in the background.</p><p>Rather than retread too much ground from Harish&apos;s in-depth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 2 review</a> — which I recommend reading — I&apos;ll focus on how the cost-cutting downgrades affect the experience, as well as my personal observations of its positives and negatives as a more budget-focused smartwatch.</p><p>While the OnePlus Watch 2 has to compete directly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, the Watch 2R&apos;s lower price matches last-gen devices like the Galaxy Watch FE or non-Wear OS watches, a much lower bar to clear.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R launched on July 16 for $229 / CA$299 in the U.S. and Canada. It originally launched as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-china-variant-launch">Watch 2 variant</a> in China with the same design, LTE support, and (surprisingly) iOS support. This Western Watch 2R version only supports Bluetooth calling and syncs with Android phones running Android 8 or higher, not iPhones.</p><p>On that note, the OnePlus Watch 2R works with any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, not just OnePlus phones. While Galaxy Watches have exclusive health features that require a Samsung phone, that doesn&apos;t apply to any OnePlus Watch 2R features.</p><p>Although OnePlus said the Watch 2R would be available through Amazon, we&apos;ve yet to find the listing. At the moment, it&apos;s available directly from OnePlus at a small discount. OnePlus says it&apos;ll cut 30% off the Watch 2R price if you buy it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-costs-more-but-its-upgrades-make-it-worth-the-price">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, though only for a limited time.</p>

<p>We called the stainless steel OnePlus Watch 2 "elegant" and "premium" looking, praising the brushed metal case and the military-tested durability. OnePlus scaled back the Watch 2R&apos;s classiness to preserve the same hardware: it switched from sapphire to Gorilla Glass and MIL-STD-810H steel to standard aluminum. </p><p>You might not love these changes, but you can always pay extra for the Watch 2 if you care about aesthetics. With this model, you still get a fully dust- and water-resistant watch you can take swimming in normal conditions. And more importantly, the material switch dips the weight from 80g / 2.8oz to 59g / 2.1oz with the strap included.</p><p>Even though our Watch 2 reviewer called its weight "very manageable," that&apos;s only true in the context of steel, big-battery watches that power users prefer. If you&apos;re more of a sporty user, or have smaller wrists, the Watch 2R will feel significantly more comfortable and won&apos;t wobble as much during fast-paced workouts.</p><p>With less weight to carry, you get the same 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a respectable 1,000 nits in high brightness mode. While that&apos;s lower than the 2,000-nit standard of new Galaxy Watches, it&apos;s actually higher than the 600-nit-max Watch 2. </p><p>And the Watch 2R design itself has a certain appeal. It&apos;s flat and fairly basic from the top down, but I like the 24-hour GMT scale bezel around the display and the textured ridge along the display edge. </p><p>We do wish OnePlus sold a smaller 1.2-inch version, as well, but that&apos;s a small complaint.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-apps.jpeg" alt="The apps drawer on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLBUy5ULSWnwQV847qeXMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> and 2GB of RAM, putting the OnePlus Watch 2R in good company. Until Qualcomm gives us a new "Gen 2" option, this is at the cutting edge for Android watch performance, and W5 watches like the Pixel Watch 2 and TicWatch Pro 5 typically cost about $350.</p><p>We described the OnePlus Watch 2 as a "Nissan Leaf with a V8 in the boot" because it handles most background tasks like heart rate data with a separate OnePlus coprocessor that barely drains any battery. The same applies to the Watch 2R: it seamlessly revs into the faster Snapdragon for active tasks like loading apps or Google Assistant queries but otherwise hums along quietly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nZiXpT7tg2oRywSpkeECbb" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-battery.jpeg" alt="The battery life summary on the OnePlus Watch 2R. It has over 3 days remaining at 82%." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZiXpT7tg2oRywSpkeECbb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That helps it last about three days in real-life use or two days with AOD active, which is pretty comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> I just finished testing — and the OnePlus Watch 2R has 90mAh less capacity. </p><p>Because Samsung doesn&apos;t use a coprocessor, it tends to burn more power while idling. With the OnePlus 2R, I was amazed at how slowly it drained battery, even as I checked health data and notifications throughout the day. Without active app use, it&apos;ll typically lose 25% battery in 24 hours, which is exactly what I want in a Wear OS watch.</p><p>Even better, OnePlus&apos; patented fast charging helps it recharge the Watch 2R in an hour or less. I can set it on the proprietary charger, walk away for ten minutes, and come back with more than enough juice to get through the rest of the day or go for a run. The pogo charger itself is a little annoying to seat on the watch, but you can clip it onto any USB-C cable, making it easy to slip into a travel bag.</p>
<h2 id="improved-fitness-accuracy-2">Improved fitness accuracy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9ULLXiozMaGNELSmLXfLyT" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-heart-rate-zones.jpeg" alt="Heart rate zones on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ULLXiozMaGNELSmLXfLyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of our biggest complaints with the original OnePlus Watch 2 was its health and fitness accuracy. Our reviewer complained that it "isn&apos;t reliable at daily step counts or activity tracking," particularly for stress data and calories. And my colleague Nick did a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">one-week Watch 2 fitness test</a> and noted that the watch did terribly during high-intensity workouts, failing to track high heart rates properly.</p><p>I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test">OnePlus Watch 2R fitness test</a> to see if it had the same issues, and came away surprised at its competence. Its dual-band GPS stayed on track with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> across multiple runs and my heart rate averages were mostly on point, only two bpm lower than Garmin&apos;s for a hard-paced track workout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-running-form-stats.jpeg" alt="Running form data on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R studies your running form and compares its balance, stride length, how quickly you take a step, and other details against other runners. It also estimates your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> based on your running pace and tells you how long to rest after a run based on its intensity and your fitness level.</p><p>While the OnePlus Watch 2R still has some fitness drawbacks (which I&apos;ll discuss later), it&apos;s not a bad option. You can find cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> with better apps for athletes, but none of them will have third-party apps; the OnePlus Watch 2R works if you want something close to budget price but still want a proper smartwatch for when you&apos;re <em>not</em> working out.</p>

<h2 id="basic-health-and-sleep-data-2">Basic health and sleep data</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qphFgHD9gxAYukiUGHf2aU" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="Heart rate tracking on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qphFgHD9gxAYukiUGHf2aU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R continuously tracks your heart rate and stress via heart rate variability (HRV), visible at any time on tiles to the right of the watch face. At night, it measures your resting heart rate, sleep stages, breathing rate, and blood oxygen (SpO2). All very standard stuff! And the stress data, in particular, feels a bit basic; it tends to fall into a specific "Normal" range that doesn&apos;t change much, even when I feel stressed.</p><p>Compare that to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, which has an ECG to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib), a continuous electrodermal (cEDA) sensor for "body response" (aka stress) in addition to HRV, skin temperature at night, and a Daily Readiness Score. Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which has active and passive AFib detection, HRV, skin temp, a daily Energy Score, and even body composition data — though I find the latter unreliable compared to a smart scale. Both watches also have some form of menstrual cycle tracking for female users, which the Watch 2R lacks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zL5hUiyzfoMDUE8C99xcWX" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-sleep-tracking.jpeg" alt="A sleep tracking summary on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zL5hUiyzfoMDUE8C99xcWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found my Watch 2R sleep insights to be accurate. My sleep and wake-up times, resting heart rate, time in deep/ REM sleep, breathing rate, and other basic sleep stats were close to what my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> smart ring tracked — and it&apos;s fairly comfortable to wear at night compared to thicker, heavier watches. That said, other watches and rings will provide a bit more in-depth data like your restlessness, how fast your heart rate drops, your energy recharge, and so on.</p><p>On that note, as much as I appreciate the OnePlus Watch 2R&apos;s revamped fitness <em>hardware</em>, the OHealth app fitness section is a bit threadbare for tracking long-term fitness trends. That&apos;s why I export its data to Strava, which is much more robust for fitness trends.</p><p>I don&apos;t necessarily expect a $229 watch to match these $300+ wearables for health insights, and the pricier Watch 2 has less of an excuse. It&apos;s just a trade-off to keep in mind.</p>
<h2 id="basic-controls-2">Basic controls</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9qjBDpNQm4Px8yDduZqsBa" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-buttons.jpeg" alt="A right-side view of the OnePlus Watch 2R and its two buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qjBDpNQm4Px8yDduZqsBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus gave the Watch 2 an inactive crown "purely for aesthetics." Admittedly, it does look classy, but it disappointed us and added weight for no reason, so OnePlus removed any confusion with the Watch 2R and cut the crown entirely. </p><p>You&apos;re left with two buttons. The top button takes you home or opens the app drawer with a tap, opens your last app with a double-tap, and Google Assistant with a long press. The bottom button opens the workout menu with a press, Google Wallet with a double-press, and the power menu with a long press.</p><p>This configuration took some getting used to, after a long time with the Galaxy Watch Ultra. I keep expecting that bottom-right button to take me back, not to a dedicated sports menu. That&apos;s something I loved having on a <em>third </em>button with the Ultra. Instead, I&apos;ve grown accustomed to swiping right to go back a screen.</p><p>Without a digital bezel or crown, swiping through menus or the carousel of tiles feels a bit ponderous. It&apos;s not a deal-breaker, and plenty of watches make you dependent on swipes. But since this is my review, I&apos;ll say that having more control choices is always good.</p>
<h2 id="no-proper-backup-system-2">No proper backup system</h2>
<p>This is a minor point, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> added the ability to backup and restore your smartwatch data and settings on your Android phone, making it much easier to either switch to a newer model or switch phones.</p><p>With the OnePlus Watch 2R, you have to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-march-update-transfer-feature">scan a QR code</a> on your old smartphone to transfer your health and fitness data to your new smartphone. And when it comes to the watch itself, you&apos;ll need to disconnect and reset your watch before you can switch, losing any watch faces or settings. This problem won&apos;t arise often, but it&apos;ll certainly make changing devices that much harder!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-competition"><span>Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:795px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CJeYDQhwnCCgTsrgCiE5RY" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-lifestyle-design-169.JPG" alt="Galaxy Watch FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJeYDQhwnCCgTsrgCiE5RY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="795" height="447" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a>, Samsung rereleased its Galaxy Watch 4 as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, and it&apos;s pretty tempting at $199. It has slower performance, a smaller display, half the storage, and about half the battery life compared to the OnePlus Watch 2R, plus no dual-band GPS. What recommends it? The sapphire glass and MIL-STD-810H protection, lighter weight, AFib detection, and an LTE version releasing later this year. Plus, Samsung should give it years of software updates.</p><p>Any other Wear OS watches in this price range have dated software and hardware. You may want to look instead at dedicated fitness watches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> costs just $20 more than the Watch 2R and has an 11-day battery life, a smaller display that makes it 20g lighter, and far superior training software for runners, cyclists, and other athletes. The downside, of course, is that Garmin watches have no third-party apps and you have to pay extra for only 1/8 the music storage.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the OnePlus Watch 2R if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a large display and Wear OS support.</li><li>You want several days between charges and fast charging so you don't have to wait long.</li><li>You care more about speed, comfort, and affordability than style and durability.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the OnePlus Watch 2R if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You'd prefer the Watch 2 for its style.</li><li>You need more rigorous health data or more specialized sleep data.</li><li>You'd prefer a dedicated fitness watch with training tools instead of apps.</li></ul>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R is a great example of how to do a budget smartwatch right, in my opinion. </p><p>Watches like the Galaxy Watch FE and Apple Watch SE are last-gen devices given a facelift to look new-ish. The cutbacks to hit their lower prices are pretty severe, designed to push more people towards the flagship. By contrast, the OnePlus Watch 2R prioritizes smarts over the design, making the performance and data mandatory and the <em>style</em> optional.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean the OnePlus Watch 2R is for everyone. If you wait for a deal event, you&apos;ll often find some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> discounted close to this price, with fewer compromises or better fashion. But in lieu of that, this is one of the best ways to get Wear OS support on a fast, large-screen smartwatch for about $100 less than Samsung or Google charge, and that&apos;s pretty great.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2R has a 1.43-inch AMOLED display, Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 CPU with a battery-saving coprocessor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 500mAh battery, and 7.5W charger — all just like the OnePlus Watch 2. The downgrade from stainless steel to aluminum makes it less striking but much lighter on your wrist (and your budget).</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Google plans to launch the Pixel 9 series on August 13, but recent leaks have already revealed much about the phones&apos; hardware and software. A new leak now sheds more light on the design, key specs, and AI features of all four upcoming models.</p><p>Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka @OnLeaks on X, has shared some exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series marketing materials with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-google-pixel-9-series-promo-material-design-specs-ai-features/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>. This leak gives us an exciting look at the key features and functions Google plans to showcase at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">August launch event</a>.</p><p>The leaked marketing materials give us a full rundown of the specs and features of Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel 9 series. Early details hint at a 6.3-inch display for the standard Pixel 9. The Pixel 9 Pro is expected to come with slightly larger screens at 6.3 and 6.8 inches, the latter possibly being the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The foldable Pixel 9 Pro Fold is rumored to have a 6.3-inch outer display and a large 8-inch main screen when unfolded.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series brings a fresh camera housing design with a noticeable bump on the back, making the new models stand out. The standard Pixel models will presumably have a dual-camera setup, while the Pro versions are expected to feature a triple-lens camera system.</p><p>However, there&apos;s a discrepancy between this new leak and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-cameras-3460690/" target="_blank">previous reports</a> on camera specs. The new info suggests the base Pixel 9 will have a 10.5MP front camera and a dual rear setup with a 50MP wide and 48MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is rumored to sport a 42MP selfie camera and a triple rear camera array: a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP telephoto lens. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold might feature a 10MP front camera and a triple rear setup with a 48MP main sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens.</p><p>For internal specs, the leak points to a uniform Tensor G4 chip across the entire Pixel 9 series, ensuring consistent performance and AI capabilities to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a> on the market. The base Pixel 9 is expected to have 12GB of RAM, while the higher-end models will likely come with 16GB.</p>

<p>The leaked images also reveal the Pixel 9 series&apos; look, showing off four colors: black, light grey, porcelain, and pink. The design features sharply rounded corners, a matte finish on the back, and polished metal edges, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">matching previous reports</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series is expected to be packed with AI-driven features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> and Circle to Search. Google is also likely to provide seven years of security updates. Plus, Pixel 9 owners will get access to Pixel Drops, a platform for exclusive features and enhancements.</p><p>As per the leaked materials, the Pixel 9 series will also have an Emergency SOS feature for real-time alerts on nearby fires and floods. For security, there&apos;s a built-in filter to guard against malware and phishing. Plus, the new Pixel Screenshots feature lets you save and find information from your screenshots easily, helping you keep track of events and places without compromising privacy.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 series launch just weeks away, secrecy around the devices is quickly fading. The August 13 event might not have many surprises left, as most of the key details are already out there.</p>

<p>Logitech is one of the big names in computer peripherals, mice, and keyboards included. So it&apos;s no wonder that a Logitech keyboard ended up being our favorite. The Logitech K480 keyboard combines a great typing experience with multiple connectivity options and portability for the best on-the-go experience. Your Android phones and tablets weren&apos;t designed to sit on a desk. They were designed as mobile devices and your keyboard should go along with them. But the keyboard experience doesn&apos;t have to stop at just your phone or tablet.</p>
<p>With the rotating dial switch, the Logitech K480 keyboard can connect to any of three different devices which means you get the same keyboard on whatever device you want. Switch between your tablet at home, your phone on the go, and your laptop at work. Having the same keyboard everywhere will just make you that much more productive. Plus, Logitech&apos;s Flow technology allows you to pair up a compatible mouse and you can type, copy, paste, and move files between devices, which is pretty powerful.</p>
<p>It&apos;s a little on the small side, sacrificing size for portability, so it may not be an ideal desktop typing experience. For example, there is no number pad on the right. But for an Android phone or tablet, this is the right size and you get a slot to hold your device upright. On top of that, the affordable accessory is spill-resistant too. The only thing that is missing is a rechargeable battery. The batteries are standard AAA batteries, so they&apos;re easy and cheap to replace and they last an estimated two years.</p>

<p>The Arteck HB030B Universal Slim Keyboard is an absolute steal for the price, averaging at around $17 to $25 at most retailers. This charming bargain might not have a full keyboard with a number pad, but it can still connect to three different operating systems: Android, iOS, and Windows.</p><p>Aside from its delightfully low price tag, the Arteck HB030B Universal Slim Keyboard also comes with a really cool feature in the form of its RGB backlighting. You can switch between seven colors and change the light&apos;s brightness levels as well. A thin slot acts as a phone or tablet holder, allowing you to slide in your Android device and prop it up when using it with the Bluetooth keyboard.</p><p>The Arteck HB030B Universal Slim Keyboard has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that lasts for about six months on a single charge. Unfortunately, this lightweight and slim keyboard still uses micro-USB for charging, so it takes two hours to recharge it fully.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for the ultimate in portability, the Samsers Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad might be best for you. The name is a bit long and wordy, but the keyboard is a solid product for Android users. It has a metal casing with sturdy ABS plastic hinges that may emote a cheap feeling, but the keyboard itself is great. It&apos;s a tri-fold 60% keyboard that gets nice and small when closed. The little anti-slip silicone bits keep the keyboard in place when unfolded.</p><p>Thanks to the Bluetooth keyboard&apos;s Scissor Switch keys, it is designed to be quiet when typing and the quality of the keys is fabulous for the price. You can purchase a base Bluetooth variant or the USB dongle version of the Samsers Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard, depending on your needs. Samsers also offers a few color options for the foldable keyboard.</p><p>The Samsers Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad supports Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Our favorite feature after its foldability is its USB-C charging port. That&apos;s right, you don&apos;t need to worry about getting triple-A batteries for this keyboard, you can top it up with your own Android phone or tablet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">Type-C charger</a>.</p>

<p>The Logitech Universal Folio is a universal keyboard case with Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity. This is yet another Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech that supports Android, iOS, and Windows devices. However, based on the size and make, we recommend it as the ideal Bluetooth keyboard for Android tablets in particular.</p><p>As long as your tablet is between nine inches to 10 inches wide, it can easily fit the Logitech Universal Folio. Unfortunately, this makes it incompatible with larger tabs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. The case protects your tablet when folded and it has a stand to prop your tab up, laptop style. It even includes a stylus holder so you can store your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">tab&apos;s S Pen or whatever stylus</a> you&apos;re using in it.</p><p>For charging, the Logitech Universal Folio uses two CR2032 cells. These are easily replaceable but you won&apos;t have to worry about that for at least a year or two.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of great Android phones and tablets out there. Maybe you just picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, or maybe you just got your hands on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Regardless of the type of Android phone or tablet you&apos;re rocking, finding a great typing experience to go along with it that&apos;s compact and portable can be a challenge. That&apos;s why we went with the Logitech K380 keyboard. It has a great typing experience, is ultra-portable, and isn&apos;t limited to just your phone or tablet.</p><p>Most smartphone and tablet users looking to get a Bluetooth keyboard for Android are interested in increasing productivity. At the core of your mobile phone or tablet experience is portability, which is why we mostly picked portable keyboards. You want to be able to take your versatile keyboard everywhere your Android device goes, so it&apos;s important that the keyboard is slim and lightweight — key proponents of portability.</p><p>If your situation differs, we have options for you too. A desktop experience can also be great on your Android device. In that situation, a mechanical keyboard that pulls out all the stops is suitable. But for a combination of all of those together, you can&apos;t go wrong with a more portable typing solution.</p>

Samsung debuted the new generation of the Z Flip earlier this month, and this leftover preorder deal is for the 512GB configuration. It also sports strong battery life, beautiful interior and cover screens, and a new design that more closely resembles the S24 line. Plus, Samsung has added dust resistance with this generation, along with an upgraded 50MP sensor for the main camera.</p>

<p>Samsung unveiled the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> earlier this month, offering a few key improvements from the last generation of its flip phones. Despite being new, Best Buy is already offering a trade-in deal for up to $460 off the Z Flip 6, and buyers will also get a $250 gift card. This capable smartphone features an upgraded camera sensor, 512GB of storage, and a more refined design than the Z Flip 5. It also boasts a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor for quick, smooth performance.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have a good phone to trade in and you&apos;re looking for an excellent deal on a new phone; you&apos;re a regular Best Buy shopper; you&apos;ve liked other Samsung products, or past Z Flip generations; you want a phone with industry-leading battery life and performance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d rather go for a cheaper phone and you don&apos;t mind looking at past generations; you&apos;re not looking for a flip phone; you need something with a headphone jack.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is just the latest generation of Samsung&apos;s history building contemporary flip phones, and it&apos;s clear that they&apos;ve got the formula pretty dialed by this point. The Z Flip 6 offers an updated 50MP camera sensor, an improved design that looks more like the S24 line, and the addition of dust resistance. Besides that, it packs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, and Samsung has recently been discounting the mid-level 512GB storage option to be the same price as the entry-level 256GB. You can also expect pretty solid battery life, and a handful of fun AI features.</p>

I&apos;ve used their products — both consumer products like phones and industrial products like remote terminal units — and thought they were best in class. As far as phones go, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-x-developer-editons-appear-verizon-version-now-available">first Moto X</a> is still one of the best and most innovative devices ever made in my opinion.</p><p>Then Google lost interest in the company, and it ended up being bought by Lenovo, one of my least favorite manufacturers. Mediocre products with terrible support meant I was happy to tell anyone that you should never buy a product with a Motorola logo on it.</p>

<p>I wasn&apos;t happy about this. Motorola had fallen from the company that made both the best "flagship" phone in the Moto X and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g-versus-moto-x">best budget phone in the Moto G</a> to a company I couldn&apos;t recommend with a clear conscious. Rehashing the same thing year after year and having a pricing strategy that made no sense made their products forgettable, and failing to support them once they were sold made them regrettable. </p><p>Motorola may not be the "American-made" company they once were, but the way the company is turning itself around shouldn&apos;t be dismissed. I think one of their phones in particular — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">The 2024 Razr</a> — is once again the best in class.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">a foldable</a> and really don&apos;t see myself using them in the immediate future. I don&apos;t think they are a fad though, and I honestly believe they will become mainstream in the coming years. Companies aren&apos;t going to stop making "regular" phones, but foldables will gain significant market share eventually.</p><p>I have a few reasons for resisting. I really do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-has-me-almost-ready-for-foldable">love the flip form factor</a> and phones like the Galaxy Z Flip and the Razr are functional and fun to use. I&apos;m not in love with the plastic screens, I think they have inherent durability issues, but most of all I hate the price. I&apos;m never going to buy a Z Flip or a Razr when I can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-google-can-sell-pixel-8a-for-just-499">Pixel 8a for hundreds less</a> and have every feature except flipping it open.</p>
<p>I know folding phones are more expensive because making them costs a lot more. But Motorola has the right idea here by releasing both the Razr Plus and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-vs-razr-plus-2023">more price-friendly Razr</a>. Samsung could do the same (and maybe it will) by announcing a Z Flip FE but Motorola is doing it now.</p><p>This ties in with the company&apos;s marketing and advertising push which feels a lot like something we would see from Samsung or Apple. It&apos;s well done, and not a bunch of numbers for nerds to fight about. It shows how fun these phones are and people want something fun. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">As Android Central&apos;s EiC Shruti Shekar points out</a>, Samsung needs to worry about this because Motorola is doing it better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL" name="Paris-Hilton-before-after-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="A young Paris Hilton with the original Hot Pink Razr V3 and again with the new Hot Pink Razr Plus 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram / Paris Hilton)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">still makes budget phones</a> and the lineup is still too confusing. I think that the company can meld the Razr marketing into something that works as well for $200 phones, letting you know why you might want one. Websites like AC can still analyze the devices, pointing out both the flaws and features if you need more information before you buy but Moto is making sure you know they exist.</p>
<p>The one concern I still have is product support. I don&apos;t mean some silly promise about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">seven OS upgrades</a> (your phone is not going to last that long nor will it be able to include all the goodies seven years from now); I mean supporting the products they sell for a reasonable lifespan. I would love to see a reasonable security patch schedule as well as prompt attention to the inevitable bugs that will pop up.</p><p>This is one area where Motorola slid from the top of the hill to the sewer and that leaves plenty of room for improvement. Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">pledged that it will improve</a>, giving a schedule it can live up to for planned updates and it should have a team in place that can handle any pressing bugs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1422px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="J6zwh2EoTM6YpydtV672Pd" name="moto-g-stylus-2024-red-in-hand.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus (2024) in Scarlet Wave" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6zwh2EoTM6YpydtV672Pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1422" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m willing to believe the company. It has shown me that it does take great pride in its products and it is spending time and money to market them. Supporting them well would be the logical choice.</p><p>Times are tough right now. They are slowly getting better and that means more people will have the means to do things like buy a new phone. It really looks like Motorola realizes this and is willing to spend money to try and make money. I think what they are doing is great and I&apos;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>My endorsement or my purchase doesn&apos;t mean much for Motorola&apos;s bottom line. But I am a firm believer that we all should "vote with our wallets" and strive to buy products and support companies we think are doing the right thing. Motorola has the right ideas when it comes to selling foldables and offers a great line of affordable products. It&apos;s working to sort out its marketing and appeal to regular folks like us and that&apos;s something we all should get behind.</p>

Samsung doesn&apos;t put apps on the outer screen by default, so there&apos;s some setting up required on your part to unlock its maximum potential.</p><p>Setting up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s cover screen needs to be done in two parts. First, you need to enable Labs and add apps to the external display. But after this basic step, the next step involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Samsung Good Lock</a> if you want widgets and even more apps.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up-cover-screen-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-2">How to set up cover screen apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</h2>
<p>Enabling access to basic apps is pretty straightforward. As with most features, you start out with the Settings app on your Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>

<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>2. Head into <strong>Advanced features</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Labs</strong>.</p><p>4. Turn on the toggle for <strong>Apps allowed on cover screen</strong>.</p><p>5. Choose the apps you&apos;d like to view on the cover screen of your Flip 6.</p>

<p>After setting up basic apps on your Flip 6&apos;s cover screen, you can add widgets to get even more use out of it. This option isn&apos;t natively available, but thankfully Samsung offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">wonderful Android app</a> to unlock the feature on your Z Flip 6.</p>
<p>1. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.goodlock"><strong>Download and install the Good Lock app</strong></a> on your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>2. Open Good Lock and <strong>install the MultiStar module</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose the <strong>I <3 Galaxy Foldable</strong> option under the MultiStar module.</p>

<p>While Samsung limits your cover screen usage to select apps, you can still customize it and get a lot done on your Z Flip 6. It&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 competitor</a>, but it&apos;s no amateur either.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve put in the work and added widgets via Good Lock, your Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s outer display is transformed into a secondary phone of sorts. You can add basic apps to it like your calendar, to-do lists, music players, or weather widgets. But then you can also turn things up by adding social media and messaging apps, video players, and even internet browsers.</p><p>Not all apps have been optimized for the Z Flip 6&apos;s tiny 3.4-inch external display, so don&apos;t expect a perfect result each time. Play around with the widgets and apps to find out what works best for you.</p>

<p>This update might be iterative, but we highly recommend getting the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 if you're new to foldable or have a generous budget. The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset is pretty powerful, plus you get a slightly larger battery, better cameras, and for the first time ever, both water and dust resistance.</p></p>

<h2 id="more-of-the-same-isn-apos-t-always-bad-but-this-time-it-is-2">More of the same isn&apos;t always bad, but this time it is</h2>
<p>Samsung has not changed the battery capacity and charging speed of the Galaxy Z Fold since the Galaxy Z Fold 4. I am certain I speak for everyone when I say that it is getting pretty tiring. The Korean tech giant has done a marvelous job of refining its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> and making them mainstream, but the stale specifications have made an excellent device quite uninteresting this time around.</p><p>You get the same old 4,400mAh lithium-ion battery made up of dual 2,200mAh batteries. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> recharges at 25W wired charging and 10-15W wireless charging speeds. You can also top up other devices with your Fold 6 at 4.5W reverse wireless charging speeds. There&apos;s nothing new or revolutionary here, which I find extremely disappointing. I&apos;ve been waiting for Samsung to update its archaic charging speeds for two generations now, to no avail. Maybe the Fold 7 will bring more drastic upgrades to Samsung&apos;s larger foldables.</p><p>To get the compatible wireless charging speeds, however, you need to make sure that you&apos;re using a compatible charging pad or stand. Samsung&apos;s wireless charging profile is called Samsung Fast Charge Wireless 2.0 and it&apos;s not available with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">Qi wireless charger</a>, so be very thorough when buying one for your Fold 6. In addition to that, your compatible 15W wireless charger needs to be plugged into a Quick Charge 2.0 PD adapter that&apos;s rated for at least 25W wired charging speeds. If you&apos;re confused or lazy to do the research, your best bet is to skip the confusion and buy a wireless charger and adapter directly from Samsung.</p><p>Things get worse when you factor in the $100 raise in the Fold 6&apos;s price. Considering the foldable phone comes with almost exactly the same dimensions, design, cameras, battery, and charging specs, the increased price tag is not justified. Sure, the Z Fold 6 has an IP48 water and dust-proof rating now, but it&apos;s not worth an extra Benjamin.</p>

<p>All the best Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 screen protectors are made of hardy 9H tempered glass, priced under $15, and come with at least two pieces in the box. Isn&apos;t that awesome? You don&apos;t have to worry about the quality or value for money. Just read through this list and pick a set that fits your needs the best.</p><p>Spigen&apos;s GlasTR EZ FIT Screen Protector for the Galaxy Watch 7 is the highest-quality screen protector for your wearable. It comes with the most straightforward, no-nonsense alignment tool I have ever seen which is super easy to use. That alone makes it worth the buy. If you don&apos;t want to spend even $15 on your smartwatch&apos;s screen guard, there are plenty of multipacks available for under $10.</p><p>For maximum value for money, I suggest getting one of the five plus five packs that come with five tempered glass screen protectors as well as five bumper cases. If you don&apos;t need splashy colors, the set from Tensea will do nicely. But if you want to match your Samsung Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s case with its paint job, KIMILAR has a wider assortment of colors such as green and pink.</p><p>When you&apos;re done picking out the right screen protector for your Watch 7, be sure to grab one or two extra watch straps as well.

By default, it pulls up your Samsung Health exercises with a single click, lets you quickly pause or restart a workout without needing the touchscreen, and even triggers an ear-ringing siren in an emergency.</p><p>At the same time, you may want to change your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>&apos;s Quick Button shortcut to something else, like a flashlight. You can also change which exercise it pulls up, disable the siren entirely, or make other simple changes.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to customize the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button in just a few quick steps!</p>

<p>1. From the Home screen, <strong>swipe down</strong> to open the <strong>Quick panel</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>.</p><p>3. Scroll down and tap <strong>Buttons and gestures</strong>. Your first options will be for the Quick button.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Action</strong>. Here, you can change the Quick button to trigger a <strong>Stopwatch</strong>, <strong>Flashlight</strong>, the <strong>Water lock</strong> mode, or <strong>None</strong> of the above.</p>

<p>4a. You can also tap the <strong>Settings cog</strong> next to <strong>Samsung Health</strong> (the default option) and change it to <strong>auto-start a specific workout</strong> like Running or Biking. Or, you can open the <strong>Multisport workouts</strong> view.</p><p>5. Back in the Buttons and gestures settings, tap <strong>Start action with</strong>. You can change this from <strong>Short press</strong> to <strong>Double press</strong>, in case you&apos;re worried about accidental button presses.</p><p>6. Lastly, you can <strong>toggle off the siren</strong> if you don&apos;t think you&apos;ll use it, so it doesn&apos;t accidentally get triggered at a bad time and deafen you.</p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-one-unfortunate-limitation-of-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">There&apos;s one unfortunate limitation of the Galaxy Watch Ultra</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-close-up.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its three buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tTzutDY4ngKuVpkBvovBN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During a workout, the Galaxy Watch Ultra Quick Button has default functions that you can&apos;t change. Tapping it <strong>once</strong> will pause or restart a workout. <strong>Double-tapping</strong> the Quick button while running or cycling will start a new lap, while it will start a new session during weight-lifting activities. And <strong>holding</strong> the Quick button will end a workout, or transition to the next workout during a multi-workout activity (like a triathlon).</p><p>Aside from the fact that we wish Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">made the Quick Button a proper crown</a> so you could scroll through menus, we also wish it had given it more customization options. Ideally, you could give it two shortcuts, one for a single press and one for a double tap. And you should be able to make one of those shortcuts open your favorite app.</p><p>Still, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung&apos;s first time implementing a third, shortcut-dedicated button across years of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> and Tizen watches. We can hope that future software updates will add new functionality to the Quick Button, so it&apos;s not quite as limited. Even as is, it&apos;s a nice perk for those willing to upgrade over the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra has a revamped Exynos CPU, double the storage, triple the health sensor LEDs, and dual-band GPS, making it faster and more accurate than almost all the fitness smartwatches out there. It's certainly on the expensive side compared to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> but has perks like multi-day battery life and an ultra-bright display to recommend it.</p></p>

<p>This week, actor and influencer Anthony Hamilton Jr <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xR5CVJH1I/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">got the chance to try out</a> Meta&apos;s AI upgrade for the Quest early, showcasing a bunch of new features that Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses owners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">have been using</a> for a few months now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ai-coming-to-quest-headsets/">UploadVR</a> notes that this new feature will officially be called "Meta AI with Vision" and Quest 3 users should expect to see this feature pop-up in the Experimental section of the settings menu in August. That should coincide with the v68 firmware update, which is also expected in August.</p><p>The new update is replacing the existing voice commands on Quest with significantly enhanced ones that are allowed to use the headset&apos;s cameras — you&apos;ll have to give it permission first, of course — to view the world around you and answer questions. Hamilton Jr used them similarly to how many people have been using the feature on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, but we figure people will find other new ways of using it with a VR headset in the future.</p><p>This is the first time we&apos;ve seen an app allowed to use the front-facing cameras to identify the world around you. Previously, all Quest apps were only allowed access to a system-created playspace for the environment, which helps secure privacy but also severely limits mixed reality apps.</p><p>Developers have been calling for Meta to improve this feature and allow access to the camera so better mixed reality apps can be made. While Meta isn&apos;t saying this feature will be opened up to third parties in the future, this is a huge milestone for a potential future where that happens.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3s</a> has been rumored and leaked for months, but this week we got the first look at the potential new budget Quest headset in person from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZGFTECH/status/1816416846796689903">VR Panda on X</a>. VR Panda is a Meta Quest 3 accessory manufacturer that&apos;s been known to leak announcements before, including the Quest 3 as well as headsets from other companies like Pico.</p><p>This track record gives us confidence that the leak is real and it lines up nicely with previous promotional material leaks for the headset, which we expect to be announced at Meta Connect on September 25.</p><p>The front of the Quest 3s sports six cameras divided into two clusters that closely resemble that of an iPhone Pro model (pick a year, they&apos;re all the same). It&apos;s thought that this new headset will sport the same powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as the more expensive Quest 3, as well as color mixed reality vision, but debut at a $299 price point.</p>

<p>Over the years, Meta&apos;s avatar system has received significant overhauls and updates as the company has tried out different art styles and ideas. When Meta made its big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">Metaverse</a> push back in 2021, it made the first moves to get rid of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-finally-getting-rid-its-hideously-ugly-avatars">previously hideously ugly avatars</a>, following that up with giving them legs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-avatars-have-legs">two years later</a>.</p><p>Now, it looks like a handful of Meta employees are testing out a previously unseen avatar design, as shown in the image above and first seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816175417922908480">by user Luna on X</a>. The new avatars do away with the more cartoony body size ratios that the current system employes — called "Boss Baby heads" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RJdoesVR/status/1816182629605204229">by some users</a> — and seem to use more realistic graphics, as well.</p><p>Meta hasn&apos;t officially announced a potential overhaul of its avatars yet but, if these turn out to be selected as the new design, we could see them get announced as early as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">September 25 at Meta Connect</a>.</p>

<p>This week, Meta updated its development tools to support better mixed reality quality, targeting how virtual objects look in the real world. The new update specifically addressed <em>how</em> virtual objects look when a physical object blocks your view of the virtual object.</p><p>In an example at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-mixed-reality-occlusion-v67-sdk-upgrade/">UploadVR</a>, a real computer chair is placed in front of a virtual guitar and the Quest mostly succeeds at making it look like the virtual object is in the real world space. The new update improves the object cutout around physical objects so that these virtual objects look like they&apos;re interacting with the real object.</p><p>Furthermore, Meta&apos;s new update uses 80% less GPU and 50% less CPU processing, meaning developers will be able to make more meaningful mixed reality experiences and games. That could potentially make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5503065683135424/">Spatial Ops</a> look and feel even more genuine.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about VR is the ability to virtually hang out with someone and make it feel like they&apos;re in the same room with you, even if they are thousands of miles away. User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1816569990428131785">Luna on X</a> found a new code in an early release version of August&apos;s v68 Quest update that points to Meta further expanding this concept, creating a feature that appears to be similar to Apple&apos;s SharePlay on Vision Pro.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, SharePlay allows iOS and Vision Pro users to make a FaceTime call, then launch an app, movie, or something else and watch it "together" by syncing the playback. This was particularly handy in the COVID quarantine days on phones but needs a VR headset to be enjoyed to its fullest.</p><p>Right now, there&apos;s little information on how this could look or work but, most likely, you&apos;ll make a call using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/social-features-and-sharing/create-or-join-group/">Meta Quest group feature</a>, then launch the app or video of your choice. The group feature is already used to make multiplayer gaming easier, so it makes sense for Meta to expand this to add functionality to make social experiences more seamless.</p>

<p>The Pirate Queen launched in April this year and it helped highlight the importance of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-pirate-queen-vr-education">learning history through virtual experiences</a>. The game, developed by Singer Studios and narrated by Lucy Liu — yes, the famous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005154/">Lucy Liu</a> — puts players in the boots of Cheng Shih, one of the most infamous pirates of all time.</p><p>That adventure has now been nominated for an Emmy, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/the-pirate-queen-wallace-gromit-vr-emmy-2024/">Mixed News</a>. The "Outstanding Emerging Media Program" award also included nominations for the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6744365485575791/">Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway on Quest</a> in addition to three other nominees.</p><p>As VR becomes more prevalent in society, we&apos;re seeing more and more award programs include VR content in addition to VR gaming. There&apos;s a special kind of empathy that comes from experiencing something first person through the eyes of another person, and it&apos;s great to see The Pirate Queen, in particular, receive this nomination.</p>
