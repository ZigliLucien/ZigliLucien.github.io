<ul><li>Google detailed its October security patch arriving for its entire Pixel portfolio during its Android 15 rollout.</li><li>The patch fixes battery/charging issues, camera stability, face unlock stability, and a Bluetooth problem.</li><li>The update is seemingly arriving alongside the Android 15 update, so users may see these fixes merged with that larger download.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amidst Google&apos;s flurry of updates for its Pixel devices, the company&apos;s security update almost went unnoticed.</p><p>Google started pushing its October 2024 security patch to Pixel devices alongside its rollout of Android 15. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/302047881/google-pixel-update-october-2024?hl=en&sjid=17912587102205814339-NA">its patch notes</a>, the patch is arriving on phones ranging from the Pixel 6 to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>. All eligible devices will download version <strong>AP3A.241005.015</strong>. Devices under Google Fi are receiving it, too; however, those will find the software with an "<strong>A2</strong>" tag.</p><p>The October patch fixes a lot for Pixel phones, beginning with battery issues plaguing the Pixel 6 series. Google states this fix aims to solve those devices "occasionally" rebooting. Moreover, charging enhancements and battery usage updates have arrived for the Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The Pixel 9, Pro, Pro XL, and Pixel Tablet suffered from a  biometric (face unlock) stability issue. Google says a fix is included with the October patch.</p><p>A Bluetooth fix between a Pixel phone and another device rolls in. Additionally, a camera stability fix for phones "under certain conditions" was highlighted.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> gained the spotlight for an issue with its inner display. Reports stated the device suffered from a "gray shade" under specific circumstances. The patch notes include a fix for this, so Fold users should look out for it.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issue occasionally preventing apps to access media files</li><li>Fix for system stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for Adaptive Connectivity Services stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>General improvements for network connection stability and performance in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue causing incorrect Android icons are displayed in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with Assistant launch animation on the lock screen</li><li>Fix for issue with home button stops responding in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with incoming call notifications in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with layouts and animations during transitions in certain conditions</li></ul>

<p>Pixel devices across the board pick up fixes for UI transitions and animations in October. Google eludes to better stability, meaning scrolling, swiping, and other gestures should appear smoother.</p><p>The company reiterated that its Pixel phones running Android 14 are eligible for the Android 15 upgrade. This October security patch is likely included with the major OS rollout.</p><p>Google and Pixel users have a lot to celebrate this month as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">Android 15 officially went live</a> yesterday (Oct 15). The software upgrade isn&apos;t as flashy as previous updates; however, Google focused on improving Android&apos;s security and privacy features. Pixels picked up three features under the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Protection</a>" banner to assist in safeguarding your data if your phone is stolen.</p><p>Things don&apos;t end there as Google rolled out its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">Pixel feature drop</a> alongside Android 15. The update had much to unpack for the Pixel 9 series like a Gemini Extension for Pixel Screenshots, underwater photography/video capabilities, and updates for the "Object Temperature Sensor." A slew of Google&apos;s past-gen Pixel phones picked up some new-age goodies alongside the Pixel Buds, Watch, and Tablet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">new version of Android rolling out</a>, many people will find their phones telling them that it&apos;s time for a software update. Undoubtably, a good many people will not want to do it even though they should.</p><p>Updating your software can be a pain. Some phones just do it quietly and tell you to restart when they&apos;re done, and others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-hours-updating-my-old-phone-only-to-make-it-worse">seem to take forever</a> and prevent you from using your phone while it&apos;s all happening. The latter is a big reason why people aren&apos;t thrilled with the idea of updating, I think.</p><p>Either way, there are three excellent reasons why you should click the button to download and install the update waiting for you: security, functionality, and compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="security-2">Security</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.46%;"><img id="vokUu4hn6MjEvQZ7eUUPXe" name="Lollipop-encryption-2.jpg" alt="Phone Security" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vokUu4hn6MjEvQZ7eUUPXe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software on your phone is riddled with flaws and potential security exploits, regardless of the brand or operating system. All software is this way, and it always will be.</p><p>Almost all of these problems will never make their way to the surface, and nobody ever realizes they are there. <em>Almost</em> all. Enough of them pop up that mobile software security has become big business, and it&apos;s fairly common to hear about some hack or exploit that bypasses the security built into your phone&apos;s software.</p><p>A lot of people are looking, too. Unsavory people. The kind of people who know how to get into your stuff and profit from it. Anytime there is profit to be made plenty of folks will try to be part of it.</p><p>You will probably never get hacked unless you do something you shouldn&apos;t, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/stop-clicking-random-short-url-links">click random links</a> or try to use cracked apps from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/third-party-app-store-aptoide-just-suffered-massive-hack-details-20-million-users-turn-online">dodgy sources</a>. But updating your phone will kill a lot of the ways people are doing it right now, forcing them to spend time looking for a new way instead of exploiting unsuspecting people.</p><p>Remember, your phone is connected to a network, which means it&apos;s connected to billions of other phones. Protecting yourself also protects everyone else.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-2">Functionality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="q9VoGU7tQ4pVHno35tVMEf" name="samsung-good-lock-23.jpg" alt="Samsung Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9VoGU7tQ4pVHno35tVMEf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every major version update of your phone&apos;s software comes with new features and unless you accept it, you&apos;re not going to be able to use them.</p><p>Some of these features probably seem dumb to you. Others also seem like something you would want to have so updating means you get both the good and the bad. Nobody says you ever need to use the dumb ones, though.</p><p>More importantly, each version update also improves functionality in other ways. Remember how I reminded you that your phone&apos;s software was riddled with flaws? Plenty of those flaws affect how your phone works, too. Updates almost always fix bugs and glitches on your phone, even the ones that might drive you crazy.</p><p>Additionally, bugs get patched out, too. Things like battery safety issues or connectivity problems are often found buried inside a version update. Even if you aren&apos;t interested in the new features you read about, you really want things like this.</p><p>A lot of people think a software update will slow your phone down, and that might be true. Your phone can only do so much, and if you try to force it to do more, it can get laggy and slow. Hopefully, the company that made your phone understands that it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-series-full-specifications-leak">have to hold some of these new user-facing features back</a> on older or budget phones. It&apos;s always better to not get a new thing than it is to ruin what used to work.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-2">Compatibility</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:768px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.82%;"><img id="hruHHe3FpJQu6r5ZQVgc4k" name="play-services.jpg" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hruHHe3FpJQu6r5ZQVgc4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="768" height="613" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Updates often provide changes your network provider needs and those are important. Your phone isn&apos;t very useful unless it can connect to the outside world.</p><p>But both Android and iOS tie features of third-party apps to the version of the operating system you&apos;re using, and that makes accepting an update more important than you may realize.</p><p>With Android, each platform version introduces a new set of APIs (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-embraces-future-ultra-wideband-apis-android">Application Programming Interface</a>) and those are how apps can work with your phone&apos;s OS and hardware. Most of these APIs go unchanged from version to version, but often we see new ones and changes that make prior versions obsolete.</p><p>Usually, Google does a good job maintaining backward compatibility so things won&apos;t immediately break but sometimes this isn&apos;t the case. Failing to take an update may cause your existing apps to stop working, mean you can&apos;t update the apps themselves, or make it so you can&apos;t install a new app.</p><p>Google tries to prevent this using what&apos;s called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google Play Services</a> for the things it likes to fiddle with, but with Play Store changes becoming a real possibility over antitrust concerns, who knows how this will work in the future?</p><p>Your best bet is to accept the software update when it becomes available for your phone.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ultimately, only you get to decide whether to install an update or not. It&apos;s your phone and nobody else gets to tell you what to do with it. You might even have a good reason to stay a version or two behind.</p><p>For most of us though, installing the update is a good idea. It&apos;s the best way to stay safe, stay compatible, and enjoy new features without buying something new.</p>

<p>Following the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> on Pixel devices, ASUS is opening the doors to its beta program for its recent gaming phone.</p><p>The Taiwanese company highlighted the start of its Android 15 Preview Program in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zentalk.asus.com/t5/rog-phone-8/rog-phone-8-join-the-android-15-preview-program/td-p/447128">ZenTalk post</a>. ASUS states users with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8</a> can start enrolling in the test for the next major Android OS. The post adds that users can experience the next release at its "first stage" and report any bugs discovered throughout the test.</p><p>To sign up, ASUS states users must head into their <strong>Settings > System > System Updates > Gear Icon (top right)</strong>. Users can tap on "Enroll in Android Preview Program" and agree to the privacy policy&apos;s terms. The post states users are required to sign up for an ASUS member account and fill out the necessary application form.</p><p>The Preview Program is in the recruitment stage, which is why the application form exists. ASUS states that you can always opt out of the program while recruiting is active.</p><p>If you&apos;ve been selected to join, the company will send an email. This email will likely contain further instructions that testers must know before joining the program. More importantly, if you do get in, everything in the Preview Program is confidential. ASUS states testers cannot post anything online about what they&apos;ve seen.</p><p>Those willing to share and discuss can do so via a new ZenTalk board, the ASUS forums, which will become available to selected users.</p>

<p>Android 15 is this week&apos;s highlight as Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">its arrival for Pixel users</a>. The latest OS release isn&apos;t quite as flashy as some might&apos;ve hoped; however, Google has implemented several enhancements below the surface. A highlight of the update is its strong emphasis on user security and safety. Android 15 brings in one-touch passkeys and advanced theft protection.</p><p>Among these safety features is "Private Spaces," a secluded area on your device where users can safeguard apps with sensitive information. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">theft protection features</a> enter via "Theft Detection Lock," "Remote Lock," and "Offline Lock."</p><p>It remains to be seen what features ASUS has planned for its ROG Phone 8 users once the recruitment period is over. What&apos;s clear is that interested parties should sign up as soon as possible before the spots fill up.</p>

While it seemingly hasn&apos;t been rolled out to everyone yet, new evidence shows new features may already be on the way to help users better take control over their privacy.</p><p>This comes from folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-profile-discovery-privacy-apk-teardown-3490456/">Android Authority</a>, who have discovered additional privacy features in their APK teardown of the latest Google Messages <strong>v20241010</strong> beta version of the app.</p>

<p>Users have to keep in mind that these options were found in the Google Messages app&apos;s setup screen. Currently, Messages allows users to turn on or off the Profile discovery feature and simultaneously see how they want their names showcased, including full name, short name, or initials.</p><p>However, new findings from the teardown give users some privacy options, like the ability to show their name and profile picture to People you message, only your contacts, or no one.</p>
<p>These new privacy options appear self-explanatory, giving users a bit more control over who gets to see their profile information. As such, you can enable the feature for your contacts so they can see your name and profile image based on your profile details, or you can hide it completely, and the person you&apos;re messaging will just have to rely on manually entered details on their end.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google providing such options for its messaging platform, which has been constantly seeing nifty improvements and adding new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-messages-wear-os-rcs-full-support-spotted">features on Wear OS</a>. </p><p>Also, these profile privacy features might be new to Google Messages, but they have been around for a while in several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Privacy features, like the ability to hide stories, statuses, etc., are incorporated even deeper into them.</p>
<p>The publication also notes that Google Messages users still cannot set their preferred profile picture but rather stick to what they put to their Google/Gmail account. It is possible that we might see the ability in future updates on Google Messages.</p><p>Now that the privacy options have surfaced in the latest Google Messages beta app, the feature will likely be officially released soon since they appear to already be available on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/14357725?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmanage-profile-sharing">Google Messages support page</a>, unless the search giant has other plans.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Amazon Kindle Scribe was very clearly a first-gen device when it launched in late 2022, with hardware flaws and limited productivity software. Amazon patched it over the next year with useful fixes, but the fundamental problems remained. Now, the Kindle Scribe 2024 fixes nearly every complaint I had with its predecessor. </p><p>Amazon announced four new Kindles on Wednesday, including its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">first color e-ink Kindle</a>. But its newest Scribe stands out for me thanks to one feature: Active Canvas. Essentially, you can now write directly on e-books and have the notes stay attached to the text, even if you resize the font or change the layout.</p><p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review" target="_blank">Kindle Scribe (2022) review</a>, I complained that the only way to annotate e-books was to tap next to a word to create a little footnote icon and then write your notes in a pop-out box. Those notes weren&apos;t visible unless you expanded them, and they covered up half of the screen. </p><p>Compared to underlining and marking up your school textbooks and novels in the margins, it felt extremely limited. At the time, I wished Amazon would let us lock an e-book into PDF format to enable notes.</p><p>It turns out Amazon took this criticism and enacted a much smarter solution with Active Canvas. As you can see in the photo above, you can write a note that reflows the book text itself and resizes it if you change the font size, so it&apos;s always anchored to that part of the text. </p><p>You can also underline and highlight text using the pen for the first time, which is a simple necessity for me. Plus, you can open a collapsable marginal column on any page and take full-sized notes, then hide the column — though this feature won&apos;t go live until 2025, according to Amazon. It&apos;s not quite as natural as writing in the margins, but it also gives you more space, so I won&apos;t complain.</p>

<p>Amazon wants the Kindle Scribe to be a note-taking tablet for students and professionals. The second-gen Kindle Scribe is "AI-powered," letting you "quickly summarize pages and pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can be easily shared—directly within the notebook tab."</p><p>I personally would prefer a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> for note-taking; I like working directly in app suites like Google Drive or Microsoft Office instead of having to export notes. But Amazon&apos;s smarts revamp is a welcome one regardless. I complained about the 1st-gen Scribe&apos;s "slow response time" for most tasks, and this AI boost gives me hope that the next version is a bit faster.</p><p>Plus, the Kindle Scribe 2024 design looks more attractive. I complained about the "massive bezel" on the first Scribe, but this design has shrunk it to a more manageable size that&apos;ll be easier to grip while adding new white borders along the edge that give it a distinct appearance from other Kindles.</p><p>The 300 ppi display and 16GB to 64GB of storage are the same, but it comes with a Premium Pen by default, and the Scribe has new fun color options to give it more personality. Unfortunately, it also costs more than the original Scribe—$399.99 and up—but now it feels like it <em>earns</em> that higher price tag.</p><p>Over Prime Day, I wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/my-fiancee-stole-my-kindle-scribe-so-im-buying-one-during-prime-day-for-25-percent-off">my fiancee stole my Kindle Scribe</a> to read e-books on a larger screen and that I wanted to buy a new one for myself despite its failings. Now, I&apos;m ready to return that Scribe and shell out full price for the Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024) once it arrives on December 4. It could very well be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-ink tablets</a> we&apos;ve seen.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is finally upgrading its Kindle e-reader line with a worthy addition that brings color to your reading life.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-color-specs-price-announce">press release</a>, Amazon stated that the new Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is ready with a 7-inch "colorsoft" display. The screen is this device&apos;s standout feature as the company highlights its soft visuals to the eye. The post states this display forgoes the typical backlighting on a regular screen.</p><p>Moreover, to improve the Colorsoft Signature Edition&apos;s colors, Amazon worked on a light guide to minimize "stray light." The tablet&apos;s display also has additional custom coatings to enhance colors and improve its optical performance. The post states users can also choose between "standard" and "vibrant" color styles. All of this was done on an oxide backplane, which Amazon says provides better color contrast, quicker response to page-turning, and upgraded image quality.</p><p>Since reading and note-taking go hand-in-hand, Amazon provides a way to do so in more colors. Users looking to highlight text for rediscovery can do so in yellow, orange, blue, and pink. Amazon adds that the Colorsoft Signature Edition features a pinch-to-zoom function, and the tablet can reportedly zoom into images "without worrying about pixelation."</p>

<p>Users with a lot in their Kindle Library can find solace with 32GB of storage. Additionally, Amazon estimates readers can get roughly eight weeks of battery life off a single full charge. The tablet can be charged via a USB-C cord, but Amazon states users have a wireless charging option. However, the "Amazon Wireless Charging Dock" is sold separately.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, the Colorsoft Signature Edition is waterproof with an IPX8 rating. This tablet offers no writing functions as that&apos;s reserved for the Kindle Scribe. Users will find Audible support, Parental Controls, and the chance to (separately) purchase a six-month Amazon Kids Plus Subscription.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s first color e-reader, the Colorsoft Signature Edition starts at $279. The post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?ref=ods_surl_se_us">can pre-order the device</a> ahead of its October 30 shipping date.</p>

<p>The Colorsoft may be the new kid on the block, but Amazon announced a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry"> series of next-gen tablets</a>, like the 2024 Kindle Scribe. Like its predecessor, the newer model features a 10.2-inch; however, Amazon added white borders around its display. The company states it took strides to make its screen smoother and more "paper-like" to bring its writing experience closer to the real deal.</p><p>AI is another highlight for the 2024 Scribe as the post states can utilize its software to summarize pages and your notes into "concise" bullet points. Amazon says the AI will transform notes into a legible script font to be shared from the notebook.</p><p>Amazon teased that "soon," users can hide their notes in the Scribe&apos;s sidebar. The 2024 Kindle Scribe is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=kindle-release-24-20&linkId=d933d9e9a0bc3cbab1af4de705aaecae&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">for pre-order</a>, starting at $399. It will ship in December.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry#:~:text=The%20all%2Dnew-,Kindle%20Paperwhite,-Since%20its%20debut">next edition</a> of the Kindle Paperwhite is here with a notable 7-inch display upgrade over its predecessor&apos;s 6.8-inch screen. With a boosted "contrast ratio," Amazon says text and images in stories should spring off the page. Hardware-wise, the next-gen Kindle Paperwhite is said to be 25% faster, meaning its response to your digital page turns is snappier.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company states the device pairs its speed with a thinner frame. Amazon touts the tablet as its thinnest Kindle to date. While the base Paperwhite features 16GB of storage, the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPP8C33?ref=ods_surl_sas_us">Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> arrives with 32GB.</p><p>The Kindle Paperwhite can be pre-ordered for $159 while its Signature Edition is up for $199. There&apos;s also an upgraded Paperwhite Kids with a $179 starting price.</p>

<p>The little ones grab a next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNVBQK38?ref=ods_surl_rik_us">Kindle Kids</a> tablet, too. Amazon states the device has been upgraded with a quicker page-turning response alongside its glare-free display. The device has been upgraded with a 25% brighter 6-inch display. Users will find 16GB of storage and a battery life that can last roughly six weeks.</p><p>The Kindle Kids (2024) can be purchased for $129.</p><p>What&apos;s more, Amazon is delivering a 2024 version of its basic Kindle tablet. The company states its entry-level device is small and pocketable thanks to its 6-inch display with an upgraded 25% brightness level. The tablet&apos;s software boosts its response, enhances its contrast ratio, and delivers ~6 weeks of battery life.</p><p>Consumers can find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P?ref=ods_surl_ri_us">the base Kindle</a> for $109.</p>

If you&apos;re treating yourself to this powerhouse of an Android tablet, you need a good Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra case to go with it. The best Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra cases are cost-effective, functional, and protective.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to break the bank to get a decent protective cover for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>.

<p>At 14.6 inches, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is an absolute unit. This gigantic and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">awesome Android tablet</a> has loads of screen real estate and plenty of power. Owing to the massive size of the tablet, you need a good quality case to make sure it doesn&apos;t get damaged from bumps or falls.</p><p>I always gravitate towards Spigen because the brand never falters. I have never had a bad experience with Spigen; they are reliable. Thus, the Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the best overall case you can get. It costs about $35, which is pretty good for such a big tablet cover. On top of being a rugged case, it has everything you could want from a Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra case. There&apos;s an S Pen slot, a sturdy kickstand, and a protective folio.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to kill two birds with one stone, the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra comes with a built-in screen guard as well as a stand integrated on its backside. It&apos;s just as rugged as the Spigen case and costs exactly the same, so it really just boils down to your personal needs and preferences.</p>

<ul><li>Roku teased a few new features preparing to arrive on its streaming dongles and TVs "this winter."</li><li>The company showcased a new "camera carousel" for its TVs, which will switch its view automatically if it detects movement.</li><li>Laptops and computers will pick up a "web view" version of Roku Smart Home for viewing live camera feeds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Roku is upgrading its smart home experience by bringing better integration with smart TVs later this year.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roku.com/blog/smart-home-features">a blog post</a>, the company teased several new features for Roku Smart Home, such as expanding the usefulness of camera feeds on your TV. Users with a Roku camera or video doorbell can already view those feeds on a TV; however, this upcoming update adds a "Camera Carousel." In this view, users can select and view a camera&apos;s live feed with additional options through its new feature.</p><p>The left side of the view will list the "carousel" first, with the remaining cameras you may have connected beneath.</p><p>Roku states the carousel will "automatically" cycle through any connected cameras on your TV. What&apos;s more, it will switch feeds depending on motion. If Roku detects movement, it will quickly switch to show you what&apos;s happening without any user input.</p><p>The company is building on its smart home and TV experience with additional notifications on the large screen. These notifications involve "events" picked up by your Roku Smart Home camera, and users will receive an alert on their TV for occurrences like packages or people at their door, as well as movements from their pets.</p><p>These alerts are wrapped in your Roku Camera subscription and enabled via the settings.</p>

<p>Lastly, Roku is extending its smart home support to smaller screens. The "Smart Home Web View" is set to debut on laptops later this year. From there, Roku states users will have access to every camera feed they have set up around the house, similar to their TV.</p><p>The company states these updates should begin rolling out "this winter." Roku reminds users that these features will arrive through a free update and will be available on Roku TVs and streaming dongles.</p><p>Roku started its journey into smart home and TV integration a couple of years ago when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-smart-home-introduces-an-array-of-cameras-lights-and-plugs">it launched its suite of devices</a>. The company saw its array of plugs, lights, and more as a "natural extension" for consumers. More importantly, Roku highlighted its devices came pre-packaged with Roku TV OS integration. This lets users quickly view a camera feed without reaching for their phone.</p><p>Additionally, the company&apos;s voice remote can be used for vocal commands to surface a camera feed.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola Edge 50 Fusion gets the October security patch, which also brings Android 15 for some lucky users.</li><li>An X user in India with the handset has recently received the latest firmware in beta.</li><li>It brings features like screen recording alerts, switching between languages, and smoother graphics.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 15 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">just landed</a> on Pixel phones, the most awaited firmware rollout for many Android device enthusiasts. While it is evident that Pixel phones are naturally the first ones to get the update, some Motorola users are also getting the chance to use Android 15, at least in beta.</p><p>According to an X user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_is_seeding_android_15_beta_to_some_of_its_phones-news-64950.php">GSMArena</a>), who happens to use a Motorola Edge 50 Fusion, has started receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> update as part of the October security patch in India.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Motorola Edge 50 Fusion has started receiving Android 15 along with October security patch in india @Moto has really stepped up the game this time isn't it! pic.twitter.com/7gL7y2q3dI<a href="https://twitter.com/singhalritik111/status/1845884918686945494">October 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>However, the X user has confirmed that it is in beta, and based on the previous tweets of the same account, it appears the user has been enrolled for Android 15 beta registration announced by Motorola in September through a community forum.</p><p>Regardless, this makes the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion among the first non-Pixel devices to experience Android 15. Per the screenshot shared by the X user, the changelog has notable elements from the latest firmware release. The software version bears the <strong>V1UUI35H.6</strong> version number and weighs 1.89GB.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost a month back @Moto opened testing opportunities for a unknown project under MFN for 50 series devices now finally we are getting notifications disclosing the project and as anticipated it's Android 15 registration those who are not active on community can now take benefit https://t.co/gSKZnhH80y pic.twitter.com/GKkZKptBTc<a href="https://twitter.com/singhalritik111/status/1843694328365101498">October 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Further, the changelog mentions that the Android 15 release will make the experience smarter, faster, and more secure. Users can also experience smoother graphics, faster app performance, screen recording alerts, and the ability to switch between languages.</p><p>It is understandable that since it is a beta rollout, not all highlighting features of Android 15, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">Theft Detection Lock</a> and Private Space to hide apps, are expected with the rollout. However, it&apos;s possible they will be available once the official rollout to Motorola Edge 50 Fusion and other latest Edge series devices begins.</p><p>In other news, Motorola has showcased its AI prowess at the ongoing Lenovo Tech World event. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">has demoed</a> a new proof-of-concept Large Action Model (LAM) that uses AI to perform functions within apps for you. For example, users can say, "Order me an iced Americano," the Moto AI seamlessly finds a nearby coffee shop, places the order (following confirmation), and lets users know it is ready.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear if or when this feature will be available, but Motorola states that its other Moto AI features are in closed beta and will expand to more users by the end of the year.</p>
