<hr>
<p>We&apos;re a little over a week from Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked event, and the full specs sheet for its new watches has leaked.</p><p>The full spec sheet for the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 was detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-et-ultra-on-vous-devoile-les-caracteristiques-integrales-et-prix-valables-en-france-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-samsung-54425">Dealabs</a>, alongside some potential colors. The larger Ultra model will seemingly debut with a 1.5-inch 480x480 resolution Super AMOLED display. Rumors state the device will arrive in one 47mm size option with 47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1 mm dimensions.</p><p>Internally, the sheet adds that the Ultra variant could feature the Exynos W1000 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Samsung&apos;s version of Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6</a>, is said to greet users out of the box.</p><p>A 590mAh battery with fast charging capabilities was highlighted, as well. Users might expect NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, 4G, Wi-Fi 2.4GHz, and 5GHz connectivity options. For its sensors, the alleged spec sheet purports a GPS, light and geomagnetic sensors, gyroscope, barometer, BioActive, temperature, and heart rate sensors.</p><p>IP6X dust resistance rating and 10 ATM waterproofing round out the alleged specifications for the Watch Ultra.</p><p>The publication adds that the colors of the device (at least, in France) include Titanium Gray, Titanium White, and Titanium Silver for its 47mm size. The device is also rumored to snag a €699 price tag in France, roughly $750. It&apos;s worth noting that pricing is always tricky, and Samsung will likely adjust it accordingly for each region.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is rumored to feature the same lineup of sensors as its Ultra sibling. However, the sheet states consumers might see two size variants: 40mm and 44mm. The former could see a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display while the latter could sport a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED like the larger model. The same Exynos SoC is supposedly featured in the watch, too.</p><p>The Watch 7&apos;s RAM and storage options are the same, while differences arise for its battery. The smaller 40mm could see a 300mAh capacity, while the 44mm nets a 425mAh battery. These sizes are similar to last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>.</p><p>The post adds that the Watch 7 could feature the same IP6X dust resistance, but its waterproofing is rated at 5 ATM.</p><p>The base model&apos;s 40mm variant with Bluetooth is said to offer green and cream options for €319 (~$342). Its 44mm option with green and silver colorways might land at €349 (~$374). The sheet suggests that its 40mm Bluetooth/4G version could snag a €369 (~$395) price tag, while its 44mm could be offered for €399 (~$428).</p><p>The Watch 7 popped up on Amazon&apos;s retail listing with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-leak">sneak peek at a few features</a>. The BioActive sensor remains consistent between the two leaks, though the Amazon listing mentioned a "Daily AI Companion," which likely references Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI. Alongside similar colors, the listing stated that consumers could expect their Watch 7 by July 16, only six days after Unpacked.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">recently appeared</a> in some official-looking renders with the Buds 3 series. From the now-removed images, the Watch Ultra was seen with a rugged band, a squarish body, and a circular watch face with multiple physical buttons.</p><p>Samsung confirmed that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">summer Unpacked event</a> will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, and consumers can begin reserving their devices.</p>

<ul><li>Android 15 Beta 3.1 is rolling out to all eligible Android beta participants via an over-the-air update.</li><li>The update fixes two particularly egregious bugs, one which prevented face unlock usage and the other that cause lockscreen interaction to sometimes break.</li><li>This update doesn't appear to fix the slow charging bug that appeared in Android 15 Beta 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re on Android 15 Beta 3 and have trouble unlocking your phone or interacting with elements on the lock screen, the latest update should make you very happy. Android 15 Beta 3.1 is rolling out to eligible phones right now.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in testing it out, here&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">how to install the Android 15 beta</a> on your supported phone.</p><p>This beta update features a fairly short list of fixes but two, in particular, are quite important. Lockscreen widgets were nigh unusable at times as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">Android 15 beta 3</a> would constantly prompt users to unlock their phones in order to interact with elements on the lockscreen. That totally defeats the point of having interactable elements on a lock screen, but thankfully, that bug has been squashed.</p><p>On the other hand, there were times when biometric face unlock didn&apos;t work in Android 15 beta 3. When this failed, though, users could still use a PIN, password, or fingerprint unlock, so while it was annoying, it wasn&apos;t experience-breaking.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes">full list of changes</a> doesn&apos;t provide much information on additional fixes other than "fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and audio quality."</p><p>Currently, the most problematic bug seems to have broken adaptive charging on Pixel devices, meaning it takes <em>hours</em> to charge Pixel phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1djxio0/charging_issue_after_update_my_8a_to_android_15/">users on Reddit</a>, overnight charging is also bugged as users have been finding that their phones still aren&apos;t charged by the time their wake-up timer goes off in the morning.</p><p>Google&apos;s smart charging solution is designed to charge your phone just before the alarm goes off so it&apos;s not sitting at 100% charge all night. There&apos;s no word yet on when this bug will get fixed. Android 15 Beta 3 rolled out on June 18, so it&apos;s possible we&apos;ll see another batch of fixes in another two weeks.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube confirmed that it is in talks with record labels about paying for access to music for “other experiments” using AI. </li><li>Google debuted a few applications for AI in music production at Google I/O in May 2024, including at a keynote preshow. </li><li>Labels and artists may entertain offers for permissive AI training due to the complexities of compensation in the streaming age, when artists earn less than a cent per stream.</li></ul>

<p>AI is swiftly entering all creative industries, as generative AI is capable of creating text, photos, videos, and even music. Google, a heavy participant in the AI race, is looking for ways to train its models to perform various tasks, including music generation. For this to work, Google needs source material to train AI models with, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> wants to partner with record labels to get it. </p><p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">already has a Dream Track feature</a> that is based on the work of nine artists. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2d9472d-32e0-43f5-8109-efb753fac330" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> reports that YouTube is in talks with record labels Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Records. A potential deal would involve YouTube paying “lump sums of cash” for the right to use the labels’ songs for AI music training. In a statement, YouTube told the Financial Times that it was “in conversations with labels about other experiments” but was not planning to grow Dream Track specifically. </p><p>It’s unclear whether copyrighted material can be used to train AI models, at least from a legal standpoint. We’ll have an answer to this dilemma eventually because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">New York Times sued OpenAI</a> last year for infringing on its copyright by using the Times’ articles to train AI models. </p><p>For now, companies that train their AI models face a high-risk and high-reward scenario. Using copyrighted material to train AI models could drastically accelerate their growth, but it could also open companies up to liability if the courts rule in favor of copyright holders like the New York Times.</p><p>The safe bet is to try and strike deals directly with copyright holders to compensate them for AI model training based on their content. In many cases, that’s exactly what Google is doing. By striking a deal with record labels themselves, YouTube would be able to use select tracks, albums, or catalogs—whatever is specified in the agreement—to train AI models and provide certain features without legal ramifications. </p><p>That’s significant because the legal ramifications could be massive. In one lawsuit, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued Suno and Udio—two AI music generation tools—for copyright infringement and asked for $150,000 in damages per violation, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/record-labels-sue-music-generators-suno-and-udio-1235042056/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>. The RIAA is a force in the music industry, representing the biggest record labels, including the ones YouTube wants to strike a deal with, like UMG.</p>

<p>The specifics on what YouTube features will require AI music training are unclear; however, generative AI music creation makes sense for the platform. YouTube has stringent copyright restrictions that limit what kind of music can be used in videos. YouTube videos with unauthorized use of copyright materials could be pulled entirely, suffer a loss of monetization, or result in a copyright strike on the posted channel.  </p><p>There are certainly ways to use music in YouTube videos. The easiest one is to find royalty-free music that is free to use in other works, usually with the provision or request that credit is given to the original creator. Still, it’s quite difficult to safely use music that you didn’t create yourself on YouTube. </p><p>AI music generation features could fix that, offering a way to create original background music for YouTube videos with zero risk of copyright implications. As such, it’s easy to see why YouTube would want to work with the major record labels.</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-the-record-labels-that-should-back-out-2">It’s the record labels that should back out</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="MNCR5i4Bt6Kn3tnttXyUEd" name="youtube-premium-up-close-galaxy-z-fold-3.jpg" alt="Youtube Premium Up Close Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNCR5i4Bt6Kn3tnttXyUEd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s perfectly clear why YouTube wants to pay record labels to license their content for AI training purposes. However, the record labels should refuse the offer. We don’t know how much YouTube is offering, but it really doesn’t matter. YouTube could give an artist or label a blank check, and they should still leave it on the table. </p><p>Right now, it’s impossible to put a price tag on creativity. Music generation tools can perform a few tricks, and they’re a great way for people who aren’t musically inclined to dabble with song creation. However, the current crop of tools has nothing on professional musicians. Most that are available today either rely on the likeness of popular singers or create something that pales in comparison to that which could be made by a human.</p><p>It’s possible—maybe even plausible—that generative AI can become so great at music generation that it replaces artists. I’m doubtful, but I’ll never bet against technology. Regardless of whether generative AI gets better at creating music, record labels and artists certainly shouldn’t help it.</p><p>A quick influx of cash might be helpful in the short run, especially as the music industry is struggling to adjust to the finances of streaming. However, it won’t be better in the long run. Once the door is open to AI music training, it can’t ever be closed. It might be tough to earn less than a penny from music streams today, but it’ll be even harder to watch AI music get created by models trained on human tracks without receiving any royalties in return. </p><p>There is precedent for record labels working with Google to ship generative AI features—after all, that’s how Dream Track was made possible in the first place. But if I was running a record label, I’d follow in the RIAA’s footsteps without thinking twice. Record labels shouldn’t give up the music in their portfolio to be used for AI training without putting up a massive fight first.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor suggests Samsung might shy away from a base model with the Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/025/0003370334?sid=101">Naver</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly preparing to begin manufacturing its next tab series, consisting of the Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/there_wont_be_a_vanilla_galaxy_tab_s10_rumor_claims-news-63519.php">GSMArena</a>). Sources claim that Samsung estimates a total of 25 million tablets sold this year, which could be thanks to its shift away from a base Tab S10. </p><p>Moreover, this departure might enable it to improve the Plus and Ultra variants. Samsung is supposedly moving toward a larger AMOLED screen, beginning at 12 inches, and with plans to go higher</p><p>Rumors claim that Samsung is moving toward a double chipset mentality, similar to its behavior with the Galaxy S24 series. The publication adds that the Korean OEM could plug a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek chip</a> into the tablet in some regions while others could grab Qualcomm&apos;s tech.</p><p>Lastly, with rumors suggesting Samsung is beginning to kickstart the manufacturing process of the Tab S10 series now, an imminent launch is unlikely. The post states that Samsung could launch its 2024 tablets "in the second half of the year."</p>

<p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">supposed leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra popped up in June, showing a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9</a> design. The device is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display, which could keep Samsung at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> list in terms of size. The back panel showed a vertical dual camera array like its predecessor. The maximum RAM/storage options are rumored to be 16GB and 1TB.</p><p>Additionally, those previous rumors suggested Samsung could opt for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon X Elite SoC, considering its shifts to compete with Apple.</p><p>Even though Samsung&apos;s tablets will likely miss out on its summer Unpacked, there&apos;s still a lot to expect. The company should debut its Galaxy Ring, next-gen foldables, and its upcoming Watch 7 series. Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Samsung confirmed</a> that its event will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, at 9 a.m. EDT, with its reserve program already underway.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is updating its smart home device ecosystem with support for the latest Matter iteration.</p><p>Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-simplifies-smart-home-experience-with-latest-app-updates/">the company&apos;s highlights</a>, the reception of Matter 1.2 SDK support for SmartThings is a notable headliner. The latest update brings a "streamlined" developer experience for those looking to improve device integration.</p><p>Moreover, the update brings more devices to Samsung&apos;s ecosystem, such as refrigerators, room air conditioners, dishwashers, laundry washing machines, robotic vacuums, air purifiers, fans, and more. Moving forward, other companies featuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2</a> support for these devices will pair with Samsung SmartThings.</p><p>The company informs users that full support for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> version will hit the app "later this summer."</p><p>Samsung adds that it has improved the "reliability" of its devices through the new Hub Manager. This centralized hub lets users create "Hub Groups" to configure their home&apos;s smart device infrastructure while also enabling Hub Backup, which will let users designate secondary hubs in case the first one falters. Troubleshooting assistance and the ability to transfer device configurations, network settings, and more will await users. </p>

<p>The ability to share your daily smart home routines will soon arrive for SmartThings homes. Samsung states folks can copy and share their custom-created routines for devices with family and guests. Shareable Routines can involve a string of devices that turn on one after another in the morning or whenever.</p><p>Users can share a routine by displaying the QR code for scanning.</p><p>A few smaller updates are included, such as better device controls. Samsung states its device cards are larger to show more of an item&apos;s controls to users. Additionally, you&apos;ll be able to select a smart home device and create a custom home control page to make things easier. New controls involve your TV&apos;s volume and light brightness. Mobile and tablet users can quickly find Device Control through the quick panel.</p><p>Samsung is reworking the UI of its SmartThings app, bringing changes to the device tab. It states the changes will "display rooms as top-level tabs" so users can find what they need and make changes without using too much time.</p><p>Door locks will be visualized in the app, as well as a notification to inform users if a device&apos;s battery has dropped below 15%.</p>

<p>Samsung then detailed that its coming SmartThings update will include ways to help users save energy. The app is picking up "gamified" energy level elements and activity badges.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> became available to device creators late in 2023. The update brought support to nine more devices, similar to what Samsung has detailed today (July 1). So long as those devices feature 1.2 support, users can control them through SmartThings regardless of the maker. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) detailed that it improved device colors and descriptions alongside some other smaller items.</p><p>With Matter 1.2 preparing to arrive for Samsung, the CSA already detailed what&apos;s new for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">1.3 upgrade</a>. Several more home appliances such as stoves and dryers will be supported, alongside EV chargers.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio makes a lot of DACs these days, and while it is proving itself in the high-end segment with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>, it is at its best in the entry-level and budget categories. The KA series delivers stellar value in this area, with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka3-portable-dac-review">KA3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka5-review">KA5</a> offering plenty of power in a tiny chassis.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> debuted last year to much fanfare, and at just $29, it became the most affordable DAC in Fiio&apos;s extensive catalog — until now. The Chinese brand has now introduced the JA11, and this dongle DAC is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007168009481.html">available at just $15</a>, or half the cost of the KA11. Obviously, I was keen to take a look at the JA11 and see how it holds up against the KA11 and the KA3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DfyRCYTHPkbmFo7kiugy4j" name="fiio-ja11-3.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfyRCYTHPkbmFo7kiugy4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KA11 by itself is tiny, and the JA11 is roughly half its size; this is basically the same size as a regular 3.5mm to USB-C dongle. The JA11 is also sold under the Jade Audio label, and that&apos;s understandable given its entry-level asking price. As such, you don&apos;t get any Fiio branding on the product; there&apos;s just a Jade Audio logo on the casing of the 3.5mm connector.</p>

<p>The USB-C connector and the DAC housing are made out of aluminum, and they&apos;re connected by a braided cable made out of silicone and yarn; the build quality is much better than anything else you&apos;ll find in this segment. It&apos;s available in white and black versions, and after three weeks of extensive use, I didn&apos;t see any issues with my unit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WT3XjSCzjm8NmAYoioMyZk" name="fiio-ja11-6.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WT3XjSCzjm8NmAYoioMyZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the KA11 is available in both USB-C and Lightning models, the JA11 is limited to USB-C, and Fiio doesn&apos;t have any plans to launch a Lightning-enabled option anytime soon. That limits its usability with older iPhones, but I tested the USB-C model with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and it connected seamlessly. It also pairs with Windows and macOS devices in addition to Android, and in this regard, it is extremely versatile — you don&apos;t need any drivers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t97YMZZ9JsdBHhVG4Eq7vi" name="fiio-ja11-1.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t97YMZZ9JsdBHhVG4Eq7vi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio usually bundles its products in a distinctive package, but the JA11 comes in a green plastic pouch, and you don&apos;t get any accessories along with it — that&apos;s understandable given what it costs. At just 5g in weight, the JA11 is small and light enough that you don&apos;t feel it; the USB-C cable I use to charge my phone weighs four times as much.</p><p>Coming to the sound, the JA11 has 32-bit/384KHz PCM and DSD128 decoding, and it facilitates inline controls and a mic, so if you&apos;re connecting earbuds that have this feature, they will work seamlessly. As the dongle DAC uses an integrated DAC chip, it isn&apos;t able to deliver quite as much power as its siblings; it goes up to 45mW at 16Ω and 30mW at 32Ω, which is less than a sixth of the 200mW the KA11 produces at 32Ω.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueCaYJMkWEn8jxp38jjYWj" name="fiio-ja11-8.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueCaYJMkWEn8jxp38jjYWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t have any issues pairing the DAC with most IEMs; I tested it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie200-review">Sennheiser IE200</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa7s-review">Fiio&apos;s FA7S</a> and the all-new FD15, and 7Hz Legato, and it did an admirable job providing adequate power. If you&apos;re using a demanding headset, you should get the KA11 instead, but if you just need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">dongle DAC</a> to use with IEMs, the JA11 holds up astonishingly well.</p>
<p>The one issue I had with the JA11 was that it needed an update out of the box; the DAC has stereo balance issues, and Fiio released the 1.7 build to address this. So before you start using the DAC, you&apos;ll need to connect it to Windows and use the provided tool to install the build.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pw7jFhVQD9JxxnmaGs6Dgj" name="fiio-ja11-7.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pw7jFhVQD9JxxnmaGs6Dgj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest highlight of the JA11 is that it has PEQ tuning; Fiio is all about this feature in 2024 after introducing it on the K19, and it works astonishingly well. You pair the DAC to Fiio Control on Android, and you get extensive access to tweak the sound profile to your liking. There are presets available, and you can set up your own and share profiles with other users.</p><p>Just like other Fiio dongle DACs, the JA11 has a neutral sound without much in the way of exaggeration, but the ability to adjust the EQ curve allows you to dynamically change the sound to your liking. In this regard, the JA11 has a distinct edge over the rest of the brand&apos;s portable products, and that is a big deal.</p>
<p>All things considered, the JA11 has the potential to a best-seller; coming in at just $15, it becomes an impulse buy, and Fiio included a ton of features with the DAC. It has standout build quality, an easily customizable sound, and drives most IEMs with ease. If you just need a dongle DAC to use on the go, the JA11 is just about the best entry-level choice.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google Pixel 9 might use Samsung’s top-notch M14 OLED display.</li><li>Samsung' advanced M14 screens supposedly offer better brightness, longevity, and power efficiency.</li><li>The second-gen Pixel Fold is also rumored to have the M14 display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> might feature Samsung’s top display technology, if a new report is any indication.</p><p>A recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240628000294" target="_blank">ET News</a> says Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel series will be rocking Samsung&apos;s latest M14 OLED screens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-series-screen-leak-3456027/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). These new panels are set to outdo the older ones with brighter displays, longer life, and better power efficiency.</p><p>Samsung has solidified its position as a top player in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> market and as a leading maker of OLED panels. Its M series pushes the limits of display quality. In this series, higher model numbers indicate better and more advanced display technology.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series supposedly features Samsung&apos;s M13 OLED screens, so the latest buzz means that Samsung&apos;s latest and greatest display will be used in the upcoming Google Pixel 9 and, quite unsurprisingly, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro models. If true, this move could give Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 Pro users an edge in brightness, color quality, and screen durability.</p><p>With the whole Pixel 9 lineup using M14 panels, Google seems set to keep up with Apple in display tech. On the flip side, rumors say the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus might stick with the older M12 panels to cut costs.</p><p>The M14 panel sounds like a top-notch display, but everyday users might not notice a big difference. If you usually keep your brightness settings moderate, the jump in display quality might not be that obvious.</p><p>Besides the Pixel 9 lineup, the second-generation Pixel Fold is also rumored to include the M14 display. This will mark the first time this advanced display technology appears on a smartphone.</p><p>Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">gearing up for a big hardware event on August 13</a>, where it will unveil its next-gen flagship devices.

<hr>
<p>Google Wallet now allows you to store digital hotel key cards on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, eliminating the need for physical keys and additional hotel apps.</p><p>Google recently updated Wallet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/15067781" target="_blank">Help page</a> to reflect the addition of support for hotel keys, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/25/google-wallet-hotel-keys/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. With participating hotels, you can now store your digital room key right in the app. This not only means no more physical cards but also lets you access keycard-protected areas of the hotel with just your phone.</p><p>Traditional hotel key cards have been the standard for room access, but they come with their own set of problems. They&apos;re easy to lose, which can lead to annoying and sometimes expensive issues for guests when it&apos;s time to check out.</p><p>To add a digital hotel key to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>, simply go to the hotel’s app, website, or follow instructions sent by email. Just tap "Add to Google Wallet," sign in securely, and your digital key will be saved in the app.</p><p>Google Wallet uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, the same tech behind "tap to pay" cards. This lets you speed up transactions by just holding your phone near a terminal. But the app isn&apos;t just for payments. If you have cards with scannable barcodes, the app can display them too, so you don&apos;t have to carry the physical card around.</p><p>Meanwhile, since the iOS 15 update , Apple Wallet has allowed iPhone users to store digital hotel keys. Now, Google Wallet brings this convenience to Android users.</p><p>However, while Google Wallet offers a great solution for digital hotel keys, it’s not yet available everywhere. Hotels need to actively integrate with Wallet for this feature to work. Right now, this adoption is still in the early stages, so not all hotels offer this option yet.</p><p>The Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg, Sweden, is the first to adopt Wallet for digital keys. Although this feature depends on individual hotels joining in, its debut at such a prominent hotel hints at a big change in the hospitality industry.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>TerraMaster is a major NAS manufacturer that predominantly focuses on the budget segment, but in recent years the brand has started making mid-range and high-end servers. The F4-423 is an interesting 4-bay NAS that is powered by the proven Intel Celeron platform, and it continues to be a solid choice two years after its debut.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting is that the F4-423 has dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports; more and more brands are now offering multi-Gigabit connectivity as standard, so this gives you much better headroom when it comes to data transfers. The rest of the hardware is decent too — you get 4GB of RAM, dual M.2 slots, and the NAS can hold a total of 80TB of data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AZ9GeX2Puxmp5WkVDSf8xn" name="terramaster-f4-423-4.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZ9GeX2Puxmp5WkVDSf8xn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest limitation of previous TerraMaster NAS servers was the software, but the manufacturer rolled out a new version at the start of the year, dubbed TOS 6, with a cleaner UI and polished features. The F4-423 debuted at $459, but it has been around for a while, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-Performance-Quad-core-Network-Diskless/dp/B09VLFYWFY">get it at $389 on Amazon</a>, making it a great value if you need a powerful 4-bay server.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RZFSSVPjFs2Hb3AhXxWifn" name="terramaster-f4-423-2.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RZFSSVPjFs2Hb3AhXxWifn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster doesn&apos;t change the design of its NAS servers, and the F4-423 looks identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/terramaster-f2-221-review">F2-221</a> and the 10GbE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f5-422-nas-review">F5-422</a> that I reviewed previously. The NAS has a metallic enclosure and is decked out in white, and the color scheme tends to stand out a bit from the black-clad models sold by most other vendors. That said, the design is elegant, and there are absolutely no issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mKsSBocMBP9sKCcxoaApon" name="terramaster-f4-423-3.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKsSBocMBP9sKCcxoaApon.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has the drive bays, and you can install 3.5-inch HDDs without the use of any tools. There&apos;s also a provision to use 2.5-inch HDDs or SSDs, and you get two M.2 2280 slots as well. The F4-423 contains a single 4GB DRAM module, but there are two SO-DIMM slots, and you can easily add an additional memory module should you need it — the NAS accommodates up to 32GB across both slots (16GB in each). Installing a new memory module or M.2 slot requires dismantling the NAS, and TerraMaster should really start offering an easier way to do this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dUUtTZXn5E6RHbZyrsm5Q" name="terramaster-f4-423-6.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dUUtTZXn5E6RHbZyrsm5Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are individual status LEDs for each HDD, and you get one for LAN connectivity and power. Both of the USB 3.1 ports are located at the back, and like most other TerraMaster servers, you get an HDMI port, making it highly convenient to connect the F4-423 to a TV.</p><p>The biggest talking point in this area is the dual 2.5GbE Ethernet ports; even if you don&apos;t have a multi-Gigabit network set up right now, you can take advantage of the connectivity should you make the switch down the line. In a similar vein, the Intel Celeron N5095 continues to be a standout choice in this category, and it has hardware transcoding, so if you&apos;re looking at a Plex media server that can handle transcodes, the F4-423 is a great choice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="shXem7XEtxEdSTpCEPiLRo" name="terramaster-f4-423-5.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shXem7XEtxEdSTpCEPiLRo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F4-423 doesn&apos;t get loud in daily use, and even under load, the noise from the dual 80mm fans at the back isn&apos;t noticeably high. I slotted in 6TB IronWolf drives in the NAS, and in over a year of use, I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever when it comes to day-to-day performance; the F4-423 has been very reliable in this regard.</p>
<p>While the hardware is among the best in this segment, the only shortcoming with the NAS is the software. TerraMaster is making progress in this area with TOS, and to the brand&apos;s credit, TOS 5 amends a lot of the issues from previous years. TOS 6 is turning out to be a huge upgrade, and it overhauls a lot of the privacy and security features and introduces a cleaner and modern UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DRULT2R7CQt4hpmVze3mY" name="terramaster-f4-423-7.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F4-423 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DRULT2R7CQt4hpmVze3mY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s still in public beta as of writing, and I wouldn&apos;t recommend installing it on your NAS, but what I&apos;ve seen of it so far is exciting. And if you don&apos;t like the look of TOS, you can always install your own, like TrueNAS Scale. It&apos;s relatively easy to do, and the extensibility makes the F4-423 a decent option if you want to tinker with the software.</p><p>Two years after its launch, the F4-423 is still a terrific overall NAS, and while the the F4-424 Pro is now available and has better hardware, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Pro-NAS-Storage/dp/B0CPPD51B9">also costs $699</a>. If you need a 4-bay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS server</a> with the best hardware in this segment and are looking to maximize value, the F4-423 has plenty to offer.</p>

<p>Last July, I discovered I&apos;d hit 225 pounds—close to "obese" for my height—having gained over 20 pounds in three years. After that, I decided to change my lifestyle to return back to my pre-COVID weight, but I ended up dipping even further, as I&apos;m currently at 192 pounds. And all my weight loss came without using a strict diet or nutrition apps but instead with the help of some useful tech items.</p><p>My weight gain snuck up on me. I ran consistently throughout my 20s and early 30s, and a walk-heavy lifestyle in Boston and New York City kept my body pretty healthy. I was never conscious of grown-up concepts like restrained eating, even as my metabolism slowed, my pace fell by minutes per mile, and my belly and love handles steadily grew.</p><p>The pandemic and this sedentary writing job were the tipping points, but I didn&apos;t realize it. I kept increasing my running mileage, finishing two (really slow) marathons in 2022 with the assumption that my effort would pay off in lost weight. Instead, the running did little to help, and the extra pounds led to a foot injury in spring 2023.</p><p>That was the catalyst for my weight loss efforts, and I treated July 2023 as a mid-year resolution moment to change things. One year later, it&apos;s paid off! So, for anyone else currently in a bit of a weight-loss slump, I thought I&apos;d share my strategy for the tech tools I used to keep myself on track—and why I didn&apos;t need dieting apps to change my eating outlook.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I&apos;m not a weight loss expert or nutritionist. I&apos;m simply showing a solution I found for myself, and I hope (but can&apos;t guarantee) it will work for others.</em></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wCMqQ3jdt7WU53n7cryAu" name="Withings-Body-Smart-eyes-closed.jpeg" alt="A 15-pound scale sits on the Withings Body Smart.

<p>First, you need a tool to track your progress. I&apos;m no expert on smart scales, but I like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/withings-body-smart-review">Withings Body Smart</a> for tracking body fat, muscle, visceral fat, basal metabolic rate, hydration, and a few other metrics. It also has an "Eyes Closed" weigh-in mode, but I learned not to let a higher weight disappoint me.</p><p>My strategy was to weigh myself consistently two times a week on Wed/Thurs and Sat/Sun. Weighing daily puts too much obsessive emphasis on everything you do in a given day. But weighing once a week leaves you without context for whether that data is accurate or just a fluke.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I mean: Since the start of 2024, I&apos;ve lost 12 pounds. But across all weigh-ins, my weight dipped 26 times, rose 18 times, and evened out twice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HcgQ2LG78CyVQpLtzuYWX4" name="withings-weight-charts.jpg" alt="Withings app screenshots showing the author's weight-loss progress from 2023 to 2024.

<p>Sometimes, I gained or lost weight solely based on muscle gain or hydration, while my body fat stayed the same. More often, I&apos;d lose body fat after a hard workout, and then my body would naturally add some fat back over the next few days. </p><p>I trended downwards from 25% to 19% body fat, but frequent weigh-ins helped me see how my body naturally fluctuates and helped me not get too depressed (or overly optimistic) because of one data point. So long as you&apos;re confident in your fitness and nutrition strategy, things should pay off in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="any-smartwatch-it-apos-s-all-about-the-steps-2">Any smartwatch (it&apos;s all about the steps)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-on-shoes.jpeg" alt="A 31-day walk streak graph on the Garmin Forerunner 965, which is sitting on top of a pair of shoes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HemBCYYfWNioseXxTnhiJ4.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Strava, I ran 234 miles in 2021, 419 miles in 2022, and 674 miles in 2023. Most people would assume the extra mileage helped me lose weight; instead, I <em>gained</em> weight even as I ran more often. I&apos;m sure every mile had a brief impact, but high-heart-rate runs burn calories, not fat, and then your body demands you replace those calories.</p><p>My first major month of weight loss was August 2023, when I walked over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, or 374,000 in total, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> to track steps. It was an extremely <em>boring</em> experiment, as I had to find ways to entertain myself for 60–90 minutes of power walking every night. However, it also helped me lose 9 pounds that month.</p><p>Why did it work? For starters, fast walking falls into the low aerobic workout category—55–75% of your maximum heart rate—that burns fat instead of carbs. More importantly, daily walks carved out about 1.5–2 hours of my day for walking, showering, and filling up on water that might normally have been spent sitting and snacking. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Find a smartwatch that gives you an accurate step count. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For people with a sedentary lifestyle and a lot of weight to carry, long walks are both a mental distraction from cravings and a low-impact physical activity, one that won&apos;t leave you too tired to exercise the next day. Just buy some good running shoes with cushy insoles to protect your feet before you start, and pick out podcasts or audiobooks to fill the hours.</p><p>Since August, I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve walked <em>every</em> day. I have way too many books to read and video games to play. But the count for my average daily steps since July 2023 is 7,829; from July 2022 to 2023, it was only 5,100, most of which came from sporadic runs. This year&apos;s fat-burning walks have made a real weight loss difference, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">hilly hikes</a>.</p><p>My Garmin Forerunner 965 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">most accurate watch for step counting</a>, but its price and features are overkill for walkers and hikers. You can technically use Google Fit or Apple Health on your phone to track steps, but phones aren&apos;t always the most accurate, and it&apos;s nice to track walking activities to check mileage and heart rate, not just steps. So I recommend any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> or fitness trackers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-google-doc-yes-really-2">A Google Doc (yes, really)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1227px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RFuESZEhjJzGvUap6iinoH" name="Google-doc-workout-log.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of my Google Doc for 2024 workout and weight loss resolutions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RFuESZEhjJzGvUap6iinoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1227" height="690" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My laptop&apos;s Chrome browser has two tabs I never close: My Gmail and my "2024 Resolutions" document. On the latter, I track my monthly miles run, miles walked or hiked, steps, exercises like push-ups and squats, and a bunch of other fitness (and non-fitness) stuff. I took a quick screenshot above to show where and how I log my information. </p><p>You can probably find hundreds of fitness log mobile apps, each with detailed graphs and motivational tools that challenge you to hit daily goals and subtly make you feel bad if you "slack off" or lose a daily streak. But these don&apos;t work for me and likely won&apos;t work for busy people with jobs or kids that&apos;ll derail your best-laid plans for days, weeks, or even months.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. Monthly targets matter more than daily streaks for busy people.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. If you&apos;re motivated to hit monthly goals, it doesn&apos;t matter if you fall behind for a few days, so long as you try to make up lost ground in free moments or bounce back the next month. </p><p>When I fell off my walking goals in February because of the cold, I consigned that lazy month to a single orange "fail" box and then rebounded, surpassing my goals in March. I never let a setback demoralize me enough to give up entirely because the Google Doc shows how many more chances I have to hit my goals this year.</p><p>Having all that data on hand at a glance—and having a low-maintenance way to update your progress with a few keystrokes—is preferable to a convoluted fitness app that you can <em>choose not to open</em> to avoid guilty feelings. You can glance at your resolutions doc at any time to celebrate your progress or challenge yourself to make up lost ground that evening. And you&apos;ll never quit on yourself.</p>
<h2 id="no-nutrition-apps-required-2">No nutrition apps required</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KpsYD7Wcf9GWtakbHqtR3f" name="Fitbit-Premium-Wellness-Reports.jpeg" alt="Fitbit Premium Wellness Report summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KpsYD7Wcf9GWtakbHqtR3f.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know plenty of people who went on strict diets to lose weight, counting every calorie and weighing their food for nutrition apps. And with no exceptions, those people fell off their diets and apps because (A) they&apos;re so much work to track and (B) they have you fixating on the impact of every single meal until the pressure and cravings escalate and you end up binge-eating.</p><p>My approach has nothing to do with eating exactly 2,000 calories (or less to lose weight) and everything to do with <em>moderation</em>. I want to lose this weight and then keep it off, and I know myself. I&apos;m not going to give up on sugar, snacks, or the occasional beer for the rest of my life, so I had to find the balance of indulging myself without going too far.</p><p>I kept things simple. I used to buy myself gummy worms (800 calories a bag) and eat them in one sitting, so I switched to buying bags or bars in the 250–400 calorie range. I used to buy bags of goldfish (840 calories) and scarf them down at my desk over a day; I knew that I couldn&apos;t just <em>stop</em> myself halfway, so I switched to Ritz peanut butter sandwich packs (200 calories) that naturally cut me off.</p><p>I inhale high-calorie snacks like crackers and chips because they don&apos;t <em>feel</em> filling, so I switched to dense snacks like bagels or protein bars that proportionally fill my stomach.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't trust myself with a full pantry of snacks, but I do trust myself to know how much food is too much without a calculator. You do too.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With alcohol, I usually like to have a couple of drinks to enjoy a buzz without overdoing it, but I&apos;d realized that a "beer gut" was a real thing. So rather than cut back my number of drinks per sitting, I cut back the number of <em>days</em> I drank, saving it for once or twice a week instead of every couple of days.</p><p>Takeout food is calorie-rich and salty, causing your body to retain water. But as much as I&apos;d love to cook every day, I&apos;m not going to, especially if I&apos;m spending hours a day walking or running. So, I simply curtailed the number of times I ordered out per month.</p><p>I can keep going, but my overall point is that weight loss doesn&apos;t need to be calculative, just relative and contextual. I know that I have bad impulse control with foods that come in large containers, so I buy snack-sized options that are more expensive but less dangerous. Then, when I&apos;m home, I freely enjoy the foods I bought for myself without guilt.</p><p>So long as I&apos;m eating less than my past self, I know it&apos;ll pay off eventually, and I&apos;ll still enjoy Five Guys and Ben & Jerry&apos;s in the long term.</p>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple-2">Keep it simple!</h2>
<p>Here&apos;s the TL;DR: I lost 30 pounds by walking an extra couple of miles per day, using tech like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-scales-for-tracking-weight-loss">smart scales</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> to track my activities and weight trends, focusing on common-sense portion control with food and drinks, and logging my progress in a Google Doc where I prioritize monthly goals over daily activity rings. It&apos;s uncomplicated, and that&apos;s why it worked for me.</p><p>These were my monthly changes in pounds since July 2023: -1.6, -9, -4, -4.5, -0.2, +0.6, -5.1, -2.6, -2, +1.2, -0.6, -2.9. After my initial weight free-fall, things have stabilized, and I&apos;ll have months where I&apos;m too sedentary or snacky to make significant progress. But I have confidence in myself that things will stay on track and I&apos;ll find the time to get walking again, especially in the summer months when the sun&apos;s out past 8 p.m.</p><p>My weight loss advice is simple: Carve out time in your schedule to walk, with or without company, and write down your progress somewhere to keep yourself honest. Don&apos;t trust yourself to deprive yourself of delicious food for the rest of your life; instead, try to find ways to eat less than you did yesterday while still enjoying those guilty pleasures in moderation.</p>
