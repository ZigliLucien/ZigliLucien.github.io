                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Obviously, there&apos;s no shortage of choice if you need a good pair of headphones — Amazon has hundreds of products on sale right now. But if you want the best in this category, you&apos;ll need to pick up Sony&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-review">WH-1000XM4</a>. These headphones are nothing short of incredible, and while they came out three years ago, they still hold up incredibly well.</p><p>Sony rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a> last year, and they&apos;re also on sale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free-dp-B09XS7JWHH/dp/B09XS7JWHH">going down to $298</a> at the moment. While I usually advocate getting the latest, the WH-1000XM4 are just as good, and considering they&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3">now available for just $198</a>, you&apos;re getting a much better value. The XM5 are better, but are they worth an additional $100? No.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c337971d-ffed-46db-ad57-3b1c53d7a3af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$198 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$198 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:148.66%;"><img id="Uae7FnLTviudbJvVbCLaHR" name="sony-wh-1000xm4-render-in-blue.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uae7FnLTviudbJvVbCLaHR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1009" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WH-1000XM4 Over-Ear Headphones: </strong><del><strong>$348</strong></del><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3" data-dimension112="c337971d-ffed-46db-ad57-3b1c53d7a3af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$198 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$198 at Amazon"><strong>$198 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>The WH-1000XM4 are still among the best headphones you can get at the moment, and this deal brings them down to their lowest price. If you've been eyeing these for a while and haven't made the switch yet, now is the time to do so.</p>
<p><br><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c337971d-ffed-46db-ad57-3b1c53d7a3af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$198 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$198 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Sony did all the right things with the WH-1000XM4. They have a lightweight design, and the ear pads are very comfortable even with extended use. The swivel design means you can get a secure fit without too much of an effort, and they fold down easily, making them a great choice for portability.</p><p>And when it comes to active noise cancellation, these headphones truly stand out. You get excellent isolation even if you&apos;re in a noisy environment, and these are particularly well-suited to flights. I clocked hundreds of hours of travel time on the XM3, and these go even further at blocking ambient noise.</p><p>All the other extras are present: you get multi-device connectivity, a rock-solid connection over Bluetooth 5.0, and if you still make regular calls, these have five built-in mics that do a great job picking up your voice. And they easily last over 20 hours, so you&apos;ll ideally need to charge once a week — and there&apos;s fast charging tech if you&apos;re in a hurry.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the sound. The WH-1000XM4 still hold their own when it comes to audio quality, delivering a vibrant soundstage with a highly engaging bass. I recommend using a utility like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pittvandewitt.wavelet">Wavelet</a> to get the best out of the sound of the XM4. Anyway, the WH-1000XM4 continue to be an easy recommendation, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3">coming in at $198</a>, you&apos;re getting an unbeatable value right now.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a fairly long length of bright outdoor lights; you want an easy-to-customize lighting set for outdoor Christmas decorations or other holidays; you want lights that can change colors using a mobile app.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you'd rather go with a more inexpensive option, even considering the discount; you're looking for a string of lights that's a different size than 100 feet, and you aren't looking to upgrade to Govee's 150-foot option.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/govee-permanent-outdoor-lights-pro-review">Govee's Permanent Outdoor Lights</a> are easy to use with smart home ecosystems like Alexa and Google Home, offering full customization over colors, brightness, and preset scenes at the sound of your voice. They come with tons of timer and scheduling options, a setting for making your lighting interact with music, and 100 separate scene modes to choose from to combine colors and overall vibes. Along with the pre-made lighting scene modes, you can also make your own, or find those programmed by other users.</p><p>The company says these are suitable for year-round outdoor use because they're made from an anti-ultraviolet material, and they feature an IP67 water and dust resistance rating—though the control box and adapter are only IP65).</p><p>While these are fairly highly reviewed on Amazon, it is worth noting that the retailer calls these a "frequently returned item." A few reviewers note that the lights stopped working after some time, though Amazon does offer a 30-day return policy in case you want to see for yourself.</p><p>The vast majority of those who left less than five-star reviews, however, mostly pointed to the mobile app as more of an annoyance than a dealbreaker. More specifically, users reported that the app is laid out pretty unintuitively and is a bit clunky to navigate, making it tough to find some settings. Ultimately, though, these lights seem to get the job done for most, and many say they appreciate their brightness and customizability.</p>

Mishaal Rahman, writing for Android Authority, managed to activate the feature early, and noted that it didn't seem to actually reduce the total number of notifications on the lock screen — though that may be coming later.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="lock_screen_notif_minimalism">Lock screen notification minimalism</string>
<string name="lock_screen_notif_minimalism_summary">Show fewer notifications on lock screen</string></code></pre>
<p>Instead, the feature currently appears to minimize lock screen notifications, only showing their icons in a tiny pill-shaped area underneath the clock. You can tap it to reveal the notification title and body for each one in the list, much like the current lock screen implementation. It adds an extra tap to the process, but might be worthwhile in exchange for the more minimalist lock screen view, which really shows off your wallpaper.</p>

<p>The <strong>Lock screen notification minimalism</strong> feature is available as a toggle in the settings app in Android 15 QPR 2 Beta 1. It can be enabled or disabled, depending on your preferences. However, it appears the feature is still in development and we don't know when it might release, or exactly what it might do when it does.</p>

<p>While the Lock screen notification minimalism feature was first discovered in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1, it's not guaranteed to debut in the public release of Android 15 QPR 2 — it could be reserved for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">Pixel Feature Drop</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Before we get deep into the holidays, Instagram is detailing a few updates for its DM experience.</p><p>Headlining the updates today (Nov 26) is the ability for users to share their live location via DMs. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-instagram-dm-features-update">Newsroom post</a>, Instagram states you can share your location "privately" in one-on-one and group chat DM threads. The platform states your shared location in a chat will "disappear after one hour."</p><p>For the sender, users in Instagram's DMs will see a small map preview detailing where in the world they are. A blue "share your location" button will submit a snapshot preview of where you are alongside your profile icon in the chat. Others can tap the "View" button to see a map with specifics.</p><p>Instagram highlights a few security/privacy advisories, stating users will notice an "indicator" at the top of a chat thread, alerting them to their shared location. Moreover, users have the option to stop sharing where they are at any time. For peace of mind, Instagram states others in your chats <em>cannot </em>"forward" your location to another chat.</p><p>The ability to share your location via Instagram DMs is rolling out today (Nov 26); however, its usability is only available "in select countries."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE" name="instagram-dms-share-location-update" alt="Instagram DMs now let users share their live location with others." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/woHgKn6BjrTHRMTHX26psE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instagram's DMs are also picking up a new nickname feature. Users will be able to customize a unique, quirky name for their friends or for themselves. As the update appears, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.instagram.com/598851592468668/?cms_platform=android-app&helpref=platform_switcher">users are instructed</a> to tap on their DMs and enter a chat. Tapping the name at the top, whether it's a group or a one-on-one thread, will open the "Nicknames" page.</p><p>A full list of those within the thread will appear alongside the option to tap on each and enter a unique title. Instagram highlights the option for users to decide <em>who </em>can edit their nickname in DMs, too. The platform states this is defaulted to "those you follow," but you can change this with a couple of other choices.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that these nicknames will not appear anywhere else but in your DMs.</p><p>Lastly, Instagram's mid-week update brings more stickers. The post states users will soon notice 17 new sticker packs become available. In total, users should have around 300 new stickers to play with and send to friends or family. All three updates should begin rolling out today (Nov 26), but it might take a while before everyone sees it.</p><p>This update for DMs arrives six days after the platform discussed an upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-bringing-recommendations-reset-button">reset option for your feed</a>. The feature is wrapped in testing; however, Meta states that users will (in the future) have the option to reset their entire set of feed recommendations. The company states this will give a user a "fresh start" when viewing feeds, exploring tabs, and watching Reels.</p><p>Durning its test, Meta states this reset button is geared toward teens as their interests/tastes tend to change and evolve over time. The company states it wants to "give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience."</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a smart ring for tracking your activities and health without paying a premium for the latest model.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't want to pay for a subscription or want the latest Oura Ring 4 for its improved health tracking.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the Oura Ring Gen 3, I was already quite impressed with its capabilities. From its impressive sleep tracking to its week-long battery life, the Oura Ring Gen 3 became a staple in my life, not just for my physical health, but my mental health as well.</p><p>Even more impressive is the fact that Oura continues to add new features and capabilities to the app and ring, making this a long-term device that you don't really have to worry about upgrading every year, which is what helped make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> we've reviewed. So even though the newer Oura Ring 4 is available, you can be sure that Oura will continue supporting the Gen 3 for as long as it can. That's what makes the smart ring worth looking at, even with Oura's low-cost $6/month subscription.</p><p>Oh, and if you're still on the fence, you should know that you can also use your FSA or HSA to purchase the ring, which could help you pull the trigger.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims Xiaomi is moving away from Qualcomm and MediaTek when it comes to its phone chips.</li><li>As a result, the Chinese OEM may put its investments into creating phone chips in-house for its 2025 series.</li><li>Google started down a similar path as it was reportedly moving away from Samsung's Semiconductors to create its own chip before leaning on TSMC for production.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New murmurings state Xiaomi is interested in dropping outside creators for its smartphone chip in 2025.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/xiaomi-readies-own-mobile-chip-pressuring-mediatek-and-qualcomm">Bloomberg</a>, the Chinese OEM is supposedly pursuing a future where it develops its SoCs in-house for its devices. The publication cites those close to the mater in saying Xiaomi could begin "mass production" of its personalized chipset in 2025.</p><p>The report highlights Xiaomi's close relationship with Qualcomm; however, this move to develop its own chip could help Xiaomi become "self-sufficient."</p><p>The company is reportedly interested in "reducing" its reliance on outside chip suppliers like Qualcomm and MediaTek. In working with Qualcomm, the publication states Xiaomi deployed certain additions on top of its chip like extra power management capabilities and "graphic enhancements."</p><p>However, branching out and developing a chip in-house would give Xiaomi the tools and leeway to create an SoC to its taste. Additionally, it seems this was expected of Xiaomi. The publication highlights a comment made by the company's Chairman and CEO Lei Jun in October, which involved Xiaomi's planned 2025 investment of 30 billion yuan (~$4.1 billion).</p><p>Lei Jun stated this money would be put forth toward the development of chips, as well as OS improvements and AI. Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review#:~:text=XIAOMI%2014T%20PRO%3A%20SOFTWARE">fueled its 14T Pro with loads of AI</a> software — even some backed by Google — but it looks interested in evolving that side of its software.</p><p>Another report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com.tw/tech/dt/n/shwnws.asp?id=0000708280_K471JZO79SMS10L2I57AM&cf=A21">DigiTimes</a> suggests Xiaomi's chip will be based on the 3nm process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-to-officially-unveil-its-custom-3nm-smartphone-chipset-next-year/">WCCFTech</a>). The Chinese publication also (allegedly) confirmed that Xiaomi will launch its custom SoC for its phones next year, doubling down on what we've heard from Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Creating a custom chip would give an OEM everything it needs to develop the right chip for its phone — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">just like Google</a>. It was reported that the OEM was pursuing the idea of parting ways with Samsung's Semiconductors in favor of TSMC. This process was reportedly going to take a couple of years before consumers would see its affects in the next-generation of Pixels.</p><p>The project was originally supposed to start with project "Redondo," but difficulties caused it to crumble. What resulted was a slightly stronger Tensor G4. However, the true upgrade is expected to be the Tensor G4, codenamed "Laguna."</p><p>A Taiwanese report claimed Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">started testing its Tensor G5</a> chip ahead of its TSMC switch in January. It was then followed up by reports that said Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">finished designing</a> its (expected) 3nm process chip in July, which means it has the greenlight to kick start its production.</p><p>The publication alludes to the possibility of Xiaomi leaning on TSMC for the production of its chip. The Taiwanese company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tsmc-us-investigation-breakdown">involved in its own issues</a> at the moment. TSMC reportedly had several of its parts find their way into Huawei's Ascend 910B AI accelerator, which is an act the U.S. government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-devices-are-losing-support-for-android-apps-heres-why-its-a-good-thing">forbade them from doing</a>. Despite TSMC not knowing — and reporting what happened itself — there's a chance the U.S. could instruct companies within its boundaries to avoid contact with the Taiwanese OEM.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung finally brings mobile cloud gaming out of beta for North America.</li><li>The new feature allows users to stream mobile games via a hub instead of locally installing them on their Galaxy phone.</li><li>Users will be able to stream games featured within in-app ads, and games are streamed via the Galaxy store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung finally announced the anticipated mobile cloud gaming platform for North America, moving it out of beta, which was released last year.</p><p>The announcement came through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-revolutionizes-mobile-gaming-commercialization-cloud-gaming-platform/">newsroom post</a> on the company’s website—spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/22/samsung-galaxy-cloud-gaming-apps/">9to5Google</a>—and is already live through Samsung Gaming Hub. In the post, Samsung describes the new platform as a means to play “full-fledged Android games” instantly without the need to download the game on your Galaxy device.</p>
<p>The aim is to make mobile gaming accessible, like streaming video, without the need to download the full game to the device. Samsung also notes that in addition to bringing such benefits to the players, it will also reduce latency and increase efficiency and scale for game publishers.</p><p>Samsung has also noted that during the beta phase of cloud gaming, the company has noticed “instant access to games dramatically increase user acquisition performance with a 50% conversion from initial click to game start,” which is believed to be a 10x improvement over the industry average.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.92%;"><img id="dhjxNB5qLqWNzHtCipnxrB" name="Samsung-Gaming-Hub-streaming" alt="Streaming on the Samsung Gaming Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dhjxNB5qLqWNzHtCipnxrB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2646" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“During the beta, cloud gaming on Galaxy devices also experienced substantial growth with a 149% increase in monthly active users year-over-year in the United States and Canada,” the company further mentioned in the aforementioned post.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, unlike other cloud gaming services where PC/console games are ported to mobile handsets, Samsung’s approach appears rather different as it focuses solely on mobile games you can already play on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Galaxy phones</a>.</p><p>The publication further cites game titles in the Gaming Hub under the newly announced cloud mobile gaming, including Monopoly Go!, Homescapes, and Marvel Contest of Champions. To start playing, you can access these titles instantly through the Samsung Gaming Hub app.</p>
<p>The streaming of these games is believed to start instantaneously; however, there seems to be a drop in resolution compared to the downloaded title. Since cloud gaming allows multiple titles, the drop in resolution seems negligible at this point.</p><p>Users have to bear in mind that they should have a Samsung account to access the Gaming Hub and these titles. Lastly, these cloud gaming titles also worked on Galaxy Z Fold 6 foldable phone.</p>

Meanwhile, closing arguments wrapped up this week in another antitrust case concerning Google's ad-tech business.</p><p>Google and the U.S. Department of Justice have two very different interpretations of how the trial went, the two sides made clear in closing arguments reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/technology/google-advertising-monopoly.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. The case began last year when the federal government and a number of states filed a lawsuit claiming that Google's advertising business was a monopoly, deriving partially from its acquisition of Doubleclick, an advertising company, more than a decade ago.</p><p>Experts suggest that following Google's loss in its search monopoly case, another successful antitrust case against the big tech company would have massive implications for regulation. That's what Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will decide in the next few months, following closing arguments from the U.S. and Google regarding the company's ad-tech services.</p><p>"Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist," said Aaron Teitelbaum, who is a lawyer for the Justice Department. "These are the markets that make the free and open internet possible."</p><p>Google rejects that notion, claiming that its successful advertising business — which accounted for more than $31 billion in revenue in 2023 — is the result of a healthy market. Advertising represents a significant portion of Google's total revenue, about one-tenth's worth, and that's large for a company with a two-trillion-dollar market valuation.</p><p>"Google’s conduct is a story of innovation in response to competition," said Karen Dunn, the lead attorney for Google. Dunn added that "the law simply does not permit, and the evidence does not support" the claim that Google's ad-tech business is monopolistic, and said the DOJ's case ended up proving "the exact opposite."</p><p>Regardless of how Judge Brinkema rules in this case, Google as we know it appears destined to change. As a result of its loss in the separate search antitrust case, the DOJ is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">asking Google to sell Chrome</a> and make changes to Android. The process will take time, and Google has until Dec. 20 to provide a rebuttal. However, in the end, Google will look different.</p>

<hr>
<p>Your eyes aren't deceiving you, Fossil is rolling out a Wear OS update for users with its latest smartwatch.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/fossil_gen_6_is_updating_bit_suprising_cause_i/">user on Reddit</a> posted a photo of their Fossil Gen 6 Venture downloading a new Wear OS update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/25/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-update/">9to5Google</a>). Several more users chimed in, stating they've also begun noticing the update appear on a Gen 6 watch. According to the publication, it seems users with a Gen 6 device will begin updating to version <strong>RFHF.240305.011</strong> today (Nov 26) or later this week.</p><p>The OP (original poster), a_blue_day, returned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/comment/lyzt349/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">to their post</a> to state the update states it's based on Android 11 (Wear OS 3.5) and contains Google's April 2024 security update.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzuxd5/fossil_gen_6_is_updating_bit_suprising_cause_i">Fossil gen 6 is updating, bit suprising cause I thought they weren't going to do that anymore?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS">r/WearOS</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The users on Reddit haven't highlighted any patch notes, which could mean it's a generic blurb of text. Curiously, another thread on the WearOS subreddit claims the update <em>might've </em>altered the look of the AOD (always-on display) notifications. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1gzd68x/fossil_gen_6_update_nov_2024/">user states</a> the AOD displays notifications in a single line, but it could've just been something they overlooked in the past.</p><p>While one user spotted the update on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-venture-edition-announced">Fossil Gen 6 Venture</a>, it seems that others with a standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fossil-gen-6-review">Gen 6</a> are seeing it, too. Users with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-wellness-edition-review">Gen 6 Wellness Edition</a> should also check their devices for the latest update.</p><p>Some users aren't seeing the update at the same time, so continue to check your device as the week progresses.</p><p>While surprising, this update for Fossil's Gen 6 devices isn't <em>that </em>surprising. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">bowed out of the smartwatch game</a> in January 2024 but left some hope. During its announcement, the company stated its Gen 6 devices would be the last ones from its kitchen. However, a major catalyst for its Wear OS departure is the competition. The company stated the smartwatch market had "evolved significantly over the past few years."</p><p>Additionally, OEMs like Google and Samsung seemed to take off in ways Fossil struggled to keep up with. Though it's gone, Fossil said it would continue to update its <em>existing smartwatches </em>"for the next few years." The last update for the Gen 6 arrived last year with the August 2023 security patch, per users on Reddit.</p>
