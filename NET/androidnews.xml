Well, you're in luck: I created this guide so all of you early birds know where to look when the preorder period finally kicks off.</p><p>If past years are any indication, you can expect Samsung's next flagship lineup to be revealed during a Galaxy Unpacked event in January 2025. We've already begun seeing a bunch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">leaks and rumors</a> about the upcoming devices, and while nothing is confirmed just yet, I've been working these events long enough to have a pretty good idea of what you can expect. From trade-in opportunities to free gift cards, keep reading for all of my Galaxy S25 preorder predictions.</p><p>While you're in the neighborhood, you should also go check out my guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">best Samsung Galaxy deals of Black Friday 2024</a> (so far) to see if you can knock out some holiday shopping early.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-come-out-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy S25 come out?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series — which is expected to include the new Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra — is likely to be announced during an Unpacked event in mid-January with an official street date later that month.</p><p>This prediction is entirely based on previous rollouts that we've seen from Samsung. The Galaxy S24 lineup, for example, was announced on January 17th, 2024 and subsequently released on January 31st. The Galaxy S23 series, on the other hand, was announced a bit later, with a February 1st, 2023, announcement and a February 17th release date.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-cost-2">How much will the Samsung Galaxy S25 cost?</h2>
<p>While nothing has been confirmed quite yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">rumors from earlier this year</a> suggest that the Galaxy S25 series' Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset may result in considerably higher price tags than previous Galaxy S phones. While we wait for official news from Samsung, you can speculate a bit by considering the price tags found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>.</p><p>The base model Galaxy S24 starts at $799 for the 128GB configuration, while the Galaxy S24 Plus costs $999 with 256GB of storage. The super-powerful Galaxy S24 Ultra is the most expensive of the bunch, with a starting retail price of $1,299 for the 256GB version. If the rumors are true, you can expect all of those prices to go up by $100 or so, which is all the more reason to look for a preorder deal when they become available.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-preorder-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-2">How do I preorder the Samsung Galaxy S25?</h2>
<p>You can begin searching for Galaxy S25 preorder deals pretty much as soon as the Samsung Unpacked event kicks off. Start by considering your options: do you have a phone to trade in? Would you rather purchase an unlocked device or shop through your wireless carrier? There are usually a ton of ways to save when new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> get announced, you just need to find the deal that works best for you. Needless to say, we'll be actively sharing all of the best offers the moment they go live, so bookmark this page if you want to be first in line.</p>

<h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-s24-drop-in-price-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy S24 drop in price?</h2>
<p>Probably! We're already seeing a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S24 deals</a> as we approach Black Friday, and while we haven't heard anything about permanent price drops, Samsung phones typically get discounted more regularly when they're no longer current-gen.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and Vivo X200 Pro come with 6000mAh batteries, with the Magic 7 Pro featuring a 5850mAh unit, the Xiaomi 15 Pro touting a massive 6100mAh cell and the iQOO 13 going up to 6150mAh.</p><p>What&apos;s interesting about this shift is that even smaller devices are getting in on the action, with the Xiaomi 15 featuring a 5400mAh battery — up from 4610mAh on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> — the Find X8 getting a 5610mAh unit and Vivo&apos;s diminutive X200 Pro Mini picking up a 5700mAh cell.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZwMjC3c9eJ6QfwBvFAfzcc" name="honor-magic-v3-hands-on-11.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwMjC3c9eJ6QfwBvFAfzcc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The reason behind this upgrade? The switch to silicon-carbon battery tech. At a high-level overview, the batteries on these devices still have lithium-based cells, but they utilize a silicon carbide anode.</p><p>Usually, lithium-ion batteries have a lithium metal oxide that acts as the cathode, with graphite or another derivative or carbon acting as the anode. With silicon-carbon batteries, the cathode is still the same, but the anode contains a mixture of silicon and graphite, and this unlocks a host of benefits.</p><p>By adding silicon to the mix, you get batteries with much greater density and higher resilience against extreme weather. Honor showcased this to good effect on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">Magic 6 Pro</a>, with the device holding its charge even in -20 degrees Celsius.</p><p>As silicon-based anodes have much better density, we get phones with significantly bigger batteries without any noticeable difference in size or weight. The OnePlus 13 includes a 6000mAh battery — 600mAh more than the OnePlus 12 — but it is thinner and 7g lighter. The same is true of all 2025 flagships that use silicon-carbon battery tech.</p><p>Other than the advantages around density and performance in inclement weather, silicon-carbon batteries should have better durability, so battery degradation may not be as noticeable even after extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE" name="honor-magic-v3-review-16.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded against a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This switch has also led to a change in the construction of the battery itself; most phones these days use a double-cell structure to maximize fast charging, but because of the increased density, silicon-carbon batteries are made out a single cell, so they won&apos;t charge as fast.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 has a 36-minute quoted charging time to 100%, with the OnePlus 12 able to do the same in 26 minutes. Obviously, the OnePlus 13 has a bigger battery, so it will take longer to charge, but it&apos;s telling that it doesn&apos;t quite hit the same figures as last year&apos;s device. Having said that, the minute difference in charging times is easily offset by all the other gains.</p><p>While the tech is making its way to other manufacturers now, Honor has been using it to great effect for two years, and the China-only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-5-pro-review">Magic 5 Pro</a>, Magic 6 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and the recent Magic V3 all use a silicon-based anode to deliver better density and efficiency.</p><p>It&apos;s good to see other Chinese manufacturers integrate the tech in their own devices, and it will be interesting to see if it trickles down to mid-range devices over the course of 2025. Combined with the gains on offer with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">MediaTek Dimensity 9400</a>, 2025 may just be a terrific year for phone upgrades.</p><p>That said, not all manufacturers are getting in on the action. Samsung isn&apos;t likely to use the battery tech on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, and I don&apos;t see Apple or Google making the switch either. These three brands are at the bottom end of the scale when it comes to battery innovation — whether it&apos;s densities or charging tech — so if you&apos;re looking to upgrade to a phone that uses the latest battery tech, you&apos;ll need to go with a Chinese brand.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has told us it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-denies-midrange-foldable-rumors">zero interest</a> in exploring a $500 Z Flip phone right now. Instead, the rumor mill suggests that Samsung may be building a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumors-rekindled-next-year">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>. This is... how do I put this delicately... so dumb.</p><p>I'm going to dive into my own opinion here for a minute and say that the flip phone is the only way foldables will ever become mainstream. Half of the issue is price; almost nobody wants to spend $1700 on a folding phone with a plastic screen and a mediocre camera. You might want to, but you're not everyone else.</p><p>The other big issue is Apple. Once you start charging a lot of money for a phone, you are in direct competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">Apple's iPhone</a> and the army of loyalists who will never be swayed. These are people who think a foldable is silly and will continue to think this way until Apple makes one, and there are plenty of them.</p><p>While it's impossible to change one of these issues, the other isn't. Just make a cheaper flippy phone.</p>

<p>I'm a grumpy old man who hates buying anything, but I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-has-me-almost-ready-for-foldable">really want a flip phone</a>. I could lie and list some technical reasons why, but I won't; I want a flip phone because I think they are cool.</p><p>There are a few things holding me back but the biggest reason is the cost. I simply can't justify spending so much money for one when I can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> so cheap. I <em>still</em> look at them on Amazon once in a while though and you never know if a compromised state of mind will make me start clicking buttons.</p><p>If I ever do, I'll bet I end up buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr</a> because it's 100% as cool and costs less money than Samsung's flip phone, especially with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-motorola-deals-2024-historic-razr-savings-usd150-off-moto-g-stylus-and-more">ongoing deals in place</a>.</p>

<p>Don't come at us with some FE nonsense either, Samsung. Your first FE phone was pretty great, but ever since, it's been product after product missing something it shouldn't be missing while still costing way too much money. You should either return the FE product line to what it started as or stop making them.</p><p>What Samsung needs to do is build a $500-ish Galaxy A Flip and win the whole damn ball game. If it doesn't, one of its competitors will.</p>
<p>Two come to mind right away: Motorola and Honor. There are plenty of companies that could build a "cheap" flip phone, but we all already know that Motorola and Honor <em>know</em> how to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">great cheap phones</a> because they've done it before. Remember the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G</a>? Could we end up seeing a Moto Razr G? The Razr 2024 is already a shockingly affordable phone, and I bet Motorola could make an even cheaper one if it wanted to.</p><p>Heck, we've seen ZTE do it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>.</p><p>At this point, Samsung deserves it if we see an even cheaper Razr G eat up its foldable market share. I know there wouldn't be a lot of profit built into a $500 flip phone, but I'm pretty sure it could be done without losing money. Breaking even to get millions and millions of eyes on your features and software services is not a bad deal.</p><p>Motorola, Honor, and plenty of other companies have the benefit of a cheap but talented labor force inside Chinese factories that can build inexpensive products of high quality. They will win this game if Samsung doesn't fight for it.</p>

<p>Nothing's latest post highlights the looming start of its Android 15 Open Beta for users eager to test the 3.0 update.</p><p>The company announced the upcoming start of its Nothing OS 3.0 (Android 15) beta via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/19373-nothing-os-30-open-beta-1-for-phone-2">Newsroom post</a>. Nothing states that all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> owners can enroll and engage with the software test tomorrow, November 6.

Users should then download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/19373-nothing-os-30-open-beta-1-for-phone-2#:~:text=How%20to%20get%20involved%20%2D%20Phone%20(2)%3A">the appropriate APK</a> and install it through their phone's "downloads" tab.</p><p>After that, head to <strong>Settings > System > Update to Beta version </strong>and tap "Check for new version." Nothing states users should follow the on-screen steps to complete the process.</p><p>The patch notes are fairly large, highlighting all the new features Phone 2 users will have as a prelude to Android 15's stable release. Among the notes is the Phone 2's reception of "Shared Widgets." According to the changelog, users can use these new widgets to "link up with friends and family." When "shared," users can view another person's widget on their device and interact with one another on an emoji basis.</p><p>These widgets were teased during Nothing and its CEO Carl Pei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-3-preview-highlights-customization-ai">preview of it</a> in September. The feature was described as a "portal" between friends and family.</p><p>The Phone 2 lock screen picks up new customization options by long-pressing the display. New, updated clock faces and an expanded widget section for more personality and usability to the lock screen.</p><p>Nothing is looking to improve the HDR processing time on the Phone 2 and portrait effects by "fine-tuning" the blur for different-sized faces. Other camera enhancements include enhancements in low-light situations, zoom slider display, and the Camera widget's launch speed.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>

<p>With the open beta set to begin on November 6, Nothing warns all testers that rolling back the beta update is "not advised." If you are going to roll back, the company insists that users back up their data as their Phone 2 will be wiped completely. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/19373-nothing-os-30-open-beta-1-for-phone-2#:~:text=upgrade%20is%20complete.-,Rollback%3A,-Rollbacks%20are%20not">a few steps</a> for those who may want to roll back the beta.</p><p>Nothing Phone 2 users are getting their turn at the Android 15 beta nearly a month after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-android-15-open-beta-start">Phone 2a folks grabbed it</a>. The patch notes remain relatively similar, except the Phone 2a patch notes didn't highlight Nothing's "shared widgets" feature. Regardless, both devices are in for several camera tune-ups, lock screen changes, and more for the Quick Settings menu.</p><p>Moreover, Nothing is right on time with its previously set schedule for Phone 2 users. The company stated last month that Phone 2 users would grab the update in November, which we're seeing detailed today. Nothing provided another look at its estimated schedule, stating Phone 1 users <em>should </em>receive access in December alongside Phone 2a Plus users.</p><p>Those with the budget CMF Phone 1 should also begin Android 15 testing in December. Nothing intends for its OS 3.0 (Android 15) update to be ready for "general" release next month.</p>

<ul><li>Google has started pushing its massive ChromeOS 130 update to Chromebook and Chromebook Plus devices.</li><li>Plus model devices pick up an AI-backed Recorder app, Quick Insert, Studio-style Mic, and more.</li><li>All devices will receive new OS-level privacy controls in the Chrome browser, the new "Focus" mode, and several enhancements for Drive and Tote.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is currently rolling out its major ChromeOS 130 update for Chromebooks with additional features for its Plus variant.</p><p>The update is reportedly arriving for more Chromebook and Chromebook Plus devices via the stable channel by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2509558/chromeos-gets-a-major-update-with-plenty-of-goodies-and-new-features.html">PC World</a>. Elsewhere, Google detailed the major patch in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/305041549">its full changelog</a> via the Chromebook Community. The update kicks off with Chromebook Plus devices as Google rolls out "Quick Insert." With the "Launcher+F key" shortcut, users can quickly place emojis, symbols, GIFs, and more without much hassle.</p><p>This feature is set to debut "on a range of devices" in 2025.</p><p>ChromeOS 130 also includes the Recorder app that brings Chromebooks closer to the experience on a Pixel phone. Google states the AI-powered app delivers speech-to-text generation, summarization, and title suggestions. More importantly, the company detailed the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-recorder-app-chromeos-130-detailed">earlier in October</a>. That post highlighted the app's "dual-column" approach with a view of its transcriptions in real-time.</p><p>The update adds a feature for the laptop's built-in microphone to enhance performance. Wrapped under the "Studio-style Mic" moniker, this feature delivers "advanced" balancing, reconstruction of fine details, and room adaptation. Google states users can find this by heading into your <strong>Settings > Device > Audio</strong>.</p><p>Appearance effects arrive in the Chromebook Plus video settings to help clean up your camera. The changelog details the addition of "Help me read" for Plus model devices. Powered by Google's AI, "help me read" is said to help users "get to the heart" of whatever they're interested in. The feature will deliver a summary of the text alongside a "freeform Q&A" space for follow-up questions.</p>

<p>The remainder of the ChromeOS 130 update pertains to features all devices should receive, such as "Focus." Users can initiate Focus via Quick Settings to reduce distractions. Google states users can place Focus on a timer and "select or create" a new Task to ensure the job gets done. Users can also lean on YouTube Music for a playlist to give them the energy; however, this is only available for Premium users.</p><p>To get you back into things after a break, ChromeOS 130 adds a "Welcome Recap." When enabled via <strong>Settings > System Preference > Startup</strong>, users can resume where they left off or engage with the laptop's suggested options. Your Drive files are updated as Google states you'll find them available via the Shelf whether you're online or not.</p><p>To help you stay on top of your work, Google added a new "Suggestions" section in Tote. This will highlight files users should pay attention to and more.</p><p>ChromeOS 130 adds multi-calendar support and more privacy controls. Google states these controls include "OS-level" features to aid users in the Chrome browser. The changelog ends by highlighting "enhanced" keyboard and display brightness controls, as well as a picture-in-picture feature for your windows.</p><p>As previously stated, ChromeOS 130 has started arriving on devices this week. Google states its update will continue "over the coming days," so it'll be wise to watch your Chromebook or Chromebook Plus for it.</p><p>This major update was teased at the start of October when Google detailed the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">two new Chromebooks</a> from Samsung and Lenovo. The former debuted a Plus model laptop with a 15.6-inch display packed with Gemini-influenced features. Lenovo introduced its Chromebook with an 11" display that focused on providing seamless notetaking features.</p>

<ul><li>Galaxy Watch 7 users have reported "ghost notifications" on their devices.</li><li>Some users blame the Google Maps "mirroring" feature while others claim the Samsung Health Platform, sensors, and activity permissions are the problem.</li><li>Users reported that restarting the device or enacting a full system wipe did not help the issue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch has been driving users mad, but only because the device is tricking folks with fake alerts.</p><p>These fake or otherwise "phantom notifications" have been ongoing for the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra and Watch 7 as users continue to report it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/watch-7-ultra-random-vibrations/td-p/10412029/page/2">Samsung's forums</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/05/galaxy-watch-random-vibrations/">9to5Google</a>). The original poster stated that their Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra has delivered "vibrations for no apparent reason." The device reportedly shakes once, stops, and then throws in three more vibrations.</p><p>A main driver of this issue is that these "notifications" are empty as users report their Watch's display doesn't light up when vibrating. In October, several more users reported the same issues — alongside some battery-draining issues.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/watch-7-ultra-random-vibrations/m-p/10449151/highlight/true#M60136">user recounted</a> a potential source of the problem: Google Maps' "mirroring" feature. They've suggested disabling it; however, this doesn't appear to solve the issue for everyone. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/watch-7-ultra-random-vibrations/m-p/10473883/highlight/true#M60413">user's report states</a> the vibrations stopped after the device "re-enabled the Health Platform's permissions." The device reportedly re-enabled these permissions "on its own," clearing the issue on one Watch 7.</p><p>While it remains unclear what the true culprit is, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/watch-7-ultra-random-vibrations/m-p/10473883/highlight/true#M60413">one user's report</a>, the problem is so inconsistent that it's causing frustration. Disabling Google Maps mirroring offered no aid nor did a full factory reset. Theories started to point toward the link between the Watch 7 and the Galaxy S24, but this is all speculation without more information from Samsung. Additional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/watch-7-ultra-random-vibrations/m-p/10473883/highlight/true#M60413:~:text=it%20could%20have%20something%20to%20do%20with%20Samsung%20Health">speculation wondered</a> if the Samsung Health app was to blame via the Bluetooth connection.</p>

<p>While frustrating, the magnitude of the problem isn't clear. Some users have the issue while others have never had it. Another issue is that it remains fairly inconsistent between devices that <em>have </em>experienced ghost vibrations.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung about these "ghost vibrations" on the Galaxy Watch 7 series. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra and Watch 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-launch">debuted in July</a> and focused on maximizing users' performance. The Ultra model delivers a 1.5-inch AMOLED display on top of a "cushion design." In short, it seems reminiscent of an Apple Watch Ultra. Aside from that, the Galaxy Watch 7 features Samsug's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">BioActive Sensor</a>. The company stated that these sensors could provide a more "accurate reading" of your vitals/health data.</p>

<p>The latest phone from OnePlus has impressive specs, including its charging speed. Just like the global variant of the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the OnePlus 13 has a charging speed of 100W but only with the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">USB-C charger</a> from OnePlus. Much like Samsung, Google, and Apple, OnePlus uses its own charging spec called SuperVOOC charging. Thanks to this, you can charge your OnePlus 13 from zero to 100 percent in only 36 minutes. Additionally, OnePlus says that with a 1% charge, you can enjoy 13 hours of standby time or 56 minutes of runtime for text chats.</p><p>The latest OnePlus 13 also supports wireless charging and can deliver 50W wireless charging, but there is a catch. As is the case with the phone&apos;s 100W wired charging, you need to use OnePlus&apos; own wireless charger to get that speed wirelessly. It also has 5W reverse wired charging that allows you to charge other devices, such as your smartwatch or another phone, via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>.</p><p>The 100W charging speed is an improvement over the previous model, but also not an improvement at the same time. It is unclear whether North American variants of the device will get the same spec. Since the region&apos;s OnePlus 12 models came with 80W charging as opposed to the global variant&apos;s 100W charging speed, it is very likely that the same might happen again with the OnePlus 13. This is mainly because of the electrical system in the region.</p><p>Even though fast charging can be a huge help when you need to charge your phone as fast as possible, it can also generate heat. Heat only damages your phone&apos;s battery, reducing battery performance, life span, and capacity. Even though the latest smartphones are made to manage heat better, it&apos;s best to avoid overheating by not using your phone for things such as gaming or other heavy-duty activities while it&apos;s charging. If you want to get more out of the charge, it&apos;s best to go with wired charging since it&apos;s more efficient than wireless.</p>

The updates include the latest security patch and some bug fixes.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-november-2024-security-update-usa-locked/">SamMobile</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> models in the U.S. seem to be the first set of phones to get the November security patch, including the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. All these models from the country are carrier-locked versions, and the firmware includes the <strong>S92xUSQS4AXJA</strong> version.</p>
<p>It further comprises multiple vulnerabilities found in the previous software version. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-november-2024-security-patch-detailed/">publication notes</a> that the security patch has 38 vulnerability fixes for the Android 14 OS the devices ship with and another 13 in Samsung’s One UI. The former is believed to have high-risk vulnerabilities, and it is encouraging to see the company tackle them with a prompt rollout of the latest security update.</p><p>However, the rollout is not limited to the Galaxy S24 series but also to the previous iterations—the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s23-november-2024-security-update-usa/">update bears</a> the <strong>S911xSQS5CXI8</strong> firmware version, which is also rolling to the carrier-unlocked versions of these models in the U.S.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Galaxy device owners in the U.S. can navigate to their device’s <strong>Settings > Software update ></strong> and hit <strong>Download and Install</strong>. The rollout of the latest firmware for carrier-locked versions is likely gradual, and handset owners across regions might receive it in the coming weeks.</p><p>The latest security patch comes amidst the anticipated One UI 7 beta rollout, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">tipped</a> to bring a major revamp for the Galaxy devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-android-15-beta-impending-arrival">Recent leaks</a> have indicated that the beta for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based update will likely debut soon, likely in the coming weeks. Samsung has already indicated that the stable One UI 7 update will commence next year, likely with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>Aside from the revamp, One UI 7 ought to bring numerous new features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">smoother animations</a> across the interface.

That said, availability issues of the global model hindered the brand's progress to an extent, and that's something Honor is looking to change with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>.</p><p>The Magic V3 uses the same design foundation as its predecessor, but it is even thinner and lighter, and honestly, it doesn't feel like you're using a bulky foldable. It is just 5g heavier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and while it is 0.7mm thicker when folded, that isn't evident when using the device.</p><p>The thin-and-light design makes the Magic V3 stand out considerably, and it just feels better to hold and use than other foldables — it makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> look archaic. I used the Magic V3 for just over a month, and here's why I think this is the best foldable you can buy today.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-pricing-and-availability"><span>Honor Magic V3: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="twyTs5HAKxddoTDn5ojg6H" name="honor-magic-v3-review-13.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view with Honor logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twyTs5HAKxddoTDn5ojg6H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor unveiled the Magic V3 in China on July 12, and the foldable went on sale in the country later in the month. The brand launched the foldable in global markets at IFA 2024, and the Magic V3 is now on sale in the U.K. and other global markets.</p><p>Honor is bringing a single 16GB/512GB variant of the device outside China, and it costs £1,699 ($2,209) in the U.K. At the moment, you can get a £300 ($390) discount on the device when buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/phones/honor-magic-v3/buy/">from Honor's website</a>, and that brings it down to £1,399 ($1,819) — £200 less than the equivalent model of the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>You also get a decent number of freebies with the foldable; Honor bundles the Band 9, a 100W charger, the X6 earbuds, and an additional six-month screen protection covering both panels.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-design"><span>Honor Magic V3: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE" name="honor-magic-v3-review-16.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded against a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLrUuViKFCaoMfwxMttpjE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor's foldable differentiation revolves around lightweight designs, and the Magic V3 is the thinnest foldable you can buy today. The device is just 4.4mm unfolded, and that's unbelievably thin; if anything, it feels like the brand could have made the device thinner if not for the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="psdMN6AjRSCF9fPwHtVofC" name="honor-magic-v3-review-1.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psdMN6AjRSCF9fPwHtVofC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultra-thin profile makes using the V3 an absolute joy; the inner screen in particular is outstanding. What's just as noteworthy is that the Magic V3 is 9.2mm thick when folded, and this more than anything else makes the foldable stand out — you don't feel like you're using a foldable at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nB4YVXpPrZbjzAw4padScF" name="honor-magic-v3-review-10.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nB4YVXpPrZbjzAw4padScF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor is the weight. At 226g, the Magic V3 isn't just lighter than other foldables — it beats conventional phones in this regard. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is 2g <em>heavier</em> than the Magic V3, and that conveys the scale of what Honor managed to achieve with the foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rC6ygy4BKyBLaDPMJYu36G" name="honor-magic-v3-review-21.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 cover panel with icons showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rC6ygy4BKyBLaDPMJYu36G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design means the Magic V3 is just as comfortable to hold and use as a regular phone. The cover screen is sufficiently wide that it isn't a problem at all — unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — and there are subtle curves around the sides and rounded edges that make a difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EMaVVxnSAX3cXRS6hjFCxC" name="honor-magic-v3-review-5.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EMaVVxnSAX3cXRS6hjFCxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with a matte texture at the back that feels great, and the green model of the Magic V3 looks understated. If you need a bold color option, the Reddish Brown variant is the one to get. The back is dominated by the camera island, which is similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The island uses an octagonal design, and the three camera modules are ensconced within.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P6j6GGXbskreSUhQiDnLgD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-12.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 back view with cameras highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6j6GGXbskreSUhQiDnLgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The steel of the camera island contrasts well with the back, and the phone doesn't wobble when using it on a flat surface. This isn't the case when the device is unfolded; as the camera island sits to the side in that mode, you get a noticeable wobble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6R8JmSxPWGBafwDKXQVo6D" name="honor-magic-v3-review-6.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 side view with hinge highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6R8JmSxPWGBafwDKXQVo6D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with a stainless steel hinge that's the thinnest in the industry, and it is durable, with the brand touting a million unfolds. Like last year, the hinge can stay open at any angle between 45 to 140 degrees, and that unlocks the ability for unique use cases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH" name="honor-magic-v3-review-31.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kqj5f2AouxK7PJkMVpejGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hinge itself has a smooth articulation and doesn't need much force to open, and while you get a visible crease, it is not as noticeable as other foldables I tested this year — the crease on the Z Fold 6 is much more prominent.</p>
<p>The aluminum frame adds rigidity to the device, and there's IPX8 water resistance, giving the Magic V3 the ability to withstand the elements. On the whole, the design is easily one of the best around, and the thin profile and lightweight chassis makes the Magic V3 a fantastic choice if you're ready to make the switch to a foldable.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-v3-displays"><span>Honor Magic V3: Displays</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MDCvJ8vPBMLSVQfpLN2myD" name="honor-magic-v3-review-32.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 semi-folded at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MDCvJ8vPBMLSVQfpLN2myD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor didn't change the sizing of the panels with the Magic V3, and the device gets the same 6.43-inch cover panel and 7.92-inch inner screen as its predecessor. Both panels go up to 120Hz and come with LTPO tech to dynamically adjust screen refresh, and the inner screen gets an AMOLED panel while an OLED display is used outside.</p><p>There's plenty of cool tech on hand this time around, and Honor continues to lead the way when it comes to making devices with eye comfort in mind. Both panels have high PWM dimming — the inner screen goes up to 3,840Hz and the cover panel hits 4,320Hz — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">AI-assisted Defocus Eyecare feature</a> is legitimately useful.</p>

<p>Both panels have good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get decent customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance to your preferences. A nifty utility that I made good use of is the ebook mode; most manufacturers offered something similar in the past, but you don't get the feature in as many devices these days, so I'm glad that Honor retained it.</p><p>In ebook mode, the screen effectively turns monochrome, making the Magic V3 a great choice for reading books — particularly on the inner screen. On the other side of the equation, the phone has Dolby Vision integration, and HDR content is a delight to stream — it makes a noticeable difference within Netflix and YouTube.</p>

<p>While the inner screen gets noticeably brighter than the Magic V2, it isn't quite as bright as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a>, which gets almost as bright as regular phones. That said, there are no issues with brightness levels on the cover screen, and it is among the brightest in this category.</p><p>Gaming is also enjoyable on the device, and the built-in sound is loud enough that you don't need to use earbuds for casual gaming sessions. While the Magic V3 has a crease — like every other foldable — it isn't as visible, and it wasn't a limitation in my usage of the device.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 has one of the best hardware packages in this segment, and there really isn't anything missing. The device features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>I didn't see any slowdowns in day-to-day use, and the Magic V3 did a great job handling demanding games. Given the limited thermal management, the foldable got considerably hotter than bar-style phones, and it throttled sooner than usual. That said, I got consistent framerates in most titles, and outside the excessive heat, there were no issues.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 managed a stability score of 71.6% in 3DMark's Solar Bay stress test, which is decent enough. However, it went up to 46 degrees Celsius in that time, and that's six degrees hotter than most 2024 foldables. The device had slightly lower scores in Geekbench 6.0 than other 8 Gen 3-powered phones I tested recently, but it wasn't an issue in daily use.</p><p>Like most other foldables, Honor uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that's baked into the power button, and while it doesn't have any problems, I would have liked to see an in-screen option.</p><p>Coming to connectivity, the device has Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, dual-band GPS, USB-C with DisplayPort 1.2, and the entire suite of AptX codecs. I didn't notice any problems when making calls or using cellular data, and I got a reliable Bluetooth connection when pairing accessories.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 has a 5150mAh battery, and just like the Magic V6 Pro, Honor uses silicon-carbon tech to deliver better density. Other brands are starting to use a similar system in their own devices, and the battery is a smidgen bigger than what we got the V2 last year.</p><p>I got a day's worth of use out of the Magic V3 between charges, but even with heavy use involving the inner panel, the foldable needed to be plugged in before the night. There aren't tangible gains in this area over the V2, and other foldables I used this year delivered better battery life.</p><p>The Magic V3 charges at 66W, and Honor bundles the requisite charger in the box. It takes just under 50 minutes to fully charge the battery, with an 80% charge attained in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Honor has sizeable upgrades on the camera front, with the Magic V3 featuring a trio of new sensors, including a 50MP f/1.6 main camera with OIS, 50MP telephoto with OIS that goes up to 3.5x zoom, and a new 40MP wide-angle lens with autofocus. You get a 20MP front camera housed inside each panel.</p><p>Honor's collaboration with Harcourt is intact, and you get three distinct styles that you can use when taking portrait shots. The camera interface itself is identical to last year, and you get the usual set of shooting modes, including the ability to take photos of fast-moving objects.</p><p>The Magic V3 takes 4K60 video at all focal lengths, and there's a dedicated video-focused night mode similar to what you get with Night Sight Video on Pixels. The Movie mode has greater control over videos, and you get a Pro mode with still images that lets you tweak individual settings.</p>

<p>While it's not on par with the Magic 6 Pro or Vivo X100 Ultra, the Magic V3 does a great job in daylight situations, with good details and accurate color rendition. The resultant photos aren't oversaturated, but they still look great.</p><p>There are three color modes available — Natural, Vibrant, and Authentic — and the latter adds a vignette to the shots. I went with the Vibrant mode as it delivered better vibrancy to the images. The new zoom lens delivers detailed photos at up to 3.5x, and it does a good job with portraits as well.</p><p>The wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right, and while it doesn't quite measure up in challenging low-light scenarios, it is better than what you get on most other foldables. The lens doubles as a macro shooter as it has autofocus, and it takes detailed photos from just 4cm away.</p><p>Overall, the Magic V3 does an admirable job in this regard. The X Fold3 Pro still has an edge when it comes to foldables, but the Magic V3 isn't that far behind, and that's a big deal in and of itself.</p>

<p>The Magic V3 runs MagicOS 8.0.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and the interface is nearly identical to previous years. Honor's UI is in need of a facelift, and while there is plenty to like, the interface still has vestiges of legacy EMUI, and that needs to change.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kuUEhGvRebZitTo46HZfSF" name="honor-magic-v3-review-23.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded with notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuUEhGvRebZitTo46HZfSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the interface itself is smooth, and the software is optimized to take advantage of the powerful hardware, so you won't see any lag or jitter in daily use. There is a noticeable uptick in fluidity, and Honor addressed long-standing issues, like the ability to not view app info while long pressing an app icon in the drawer. Honor's take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>'s Dynamic Island is useful, and I found myself using the feature quite a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJMDMfEU6QUH3rf6FzWkZG" name="honor-magic-v3-review-24.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 unfolded with taskbar showing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJMDMfEU6QUH3rf6FzWkZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the suggestions bar located at the top of the app drawer still doesn't deliver useful apps, and you get the same list of utilities all the time. Memory management continues to be aggressive, and there were issues with push notifications at times. Outside of those bugbears, I didn't see any problems with the Magic V3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8KkM2LQkzFPtuyJRddiAmH" name="honor-magic-v3-review-36.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 Dynamic Island clone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8KkM2LQkzFPtuyJRddiAmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's plenty of AI-based utilities as well, and Magic Portal is useful if you want to collate information or look up a photo online. Honor teamed up with Google to enable face-to-face translation, and the feature does a great job. You also get Circle to Search, and a host of other Google utilities.</p><p>Coming to foldable use, there's plenty to like on the Magic V3. There's a split notification shade, a taskbar that's easily accessible, and intuitive multi-window modes. The basics are covered here, and you get a good amount of customization as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to software updates, the Magic V3 will get the same four years of Android OS updates alongside five years of security patches. While that's not as many as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6, it is in line with what other Chinese manufacturers deliver, but I'd like to see Honor do better in this regard. </p>

<p>Foldables are no longer a niche, and there are plenty of great choices in this category. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the obvious starting point for a lot of users, but I wouldn't even pit the foldable in the same league as the Magic V3 — it feels a few generations behind in terms of the hardware.</p><p>Vivo's X Fold3 Pro is the closest rival to the Magic V3, with the device offering a svelte design, terrific hardware, great battery life, and outstanding cameras. It has the best battery life of any foldable I used this year, and the best overall cameras. The only limiting factor is that it is sold in just a few countries globally, and if anything, that works out to Honor's advantage.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is a good foldable as well, and it has the best software and AI-based features in this category. The design is much better than its predecessor, and while it isn't powerful by any measure, it doesn't have issues in daily use. But the biggest issue with the 9 Pro Fold is that the cameras just aren't good enough, and if that's a consideration, you should just get the Magic V3.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the thinnest foldable available today</li><li>You need bright OLED panels that are easy on the eyes</li><li>You want powerful hardware and great cameras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best battery life</li><li>You need in-screen sensors</li></ul>
<p>The Magic V3 has its drawbacks; the X Fold3 Pro has better battery life, and I like the fact that Vivo somehow managed to slot in two in-screen sensors, instead of the side-mounted fingerprint reader that's standard on every other device in this segment.</p><p>Vivo also has an edge when it comes to the cameras, with the auxiliary lenses in particular delivering fabulous shots. That said, the Magic V3 does a great job in its own right, and it has one of the best camera packages in this category — it outshines the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold by a considerable margin.</p><p>The Magic V3 also has the brightest OLED panel of any foldable, and Honor leads the pack when it comes to eye-friendly tech. The hardware is among the best in this class, and while it isn't a huge upgrade over the Magic V2, there are enough small tweaks to give the V3 an edge.</p><p>Ultimately, I prefer the Magic V3 because of the design, and I like the direction Honor is taking with the software. MagicOS needs a visual overhaul, but the upcoming MagicOS 9.0 build looks interesting to say the least, and the brand has a ton of custom features and is leaning heavily on AI utilities you'll actually end up using.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how many times a week I get asked, "What phone should I buy, Namerah?". What most people fail to ask, however, is what steps you need to take <em>after</em> you've bought your phone. Since nobody asked, I'm going to tell you anyway.</p><p>Once you've spent your very hard-earned money on something, you obviously want it to last. Phones are investments, people; they require some good TLC. If you intend to hold on to your device for at least two to three years, you can't use it as is out of the box. Preserving its condition is important, especially when you intend to trade it in a few years down the line. The better the condition, the higher the trade-in value.</p><p>If you're rocking a ball-busting flagship, the last thing you'd want is a scratch or crack. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> cost over a thousand dollars these days. Who wouldn't want to keep that valuable of a possession in good shape?</p><p>So, here are the first five things that you need to buy right after purchasing your brand-new phone. Some of these add-ons protect your phone, while others provide essential services.</p>

<h2 id="1-a-charging-brick-2">1. A charging brick</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XrWuoQNfJKvkCdDp5FbTzm" name="ugreen-nexode-100w-1.jpg" alt="UGREEN Nexode 100W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrWuoQNfJKvkCdDp5FbTzm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the trend with modern smartphones is to eliminate useful things and then call it a feature. Just like headphone jacks and microSD card slots, USB-C chargers are no longer available with newer Android and iOS phones. You do get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> in the box, but not the adapter to plug into, so it needs to be bought separately.</p><p>While you probably have a charging brick lying around at home, the wattage and ports need to be correct so you can get your phone's maximum charging speed. Another factor to worry about is whether your phone has a specific fast charging standard that needs to be met, like Programmable Power Supply (PPS) or Power Deliver (PD).</p><p>I won't get into the specifics, but be sure to read the fine print and match your phone's fast charging standard with the charger that you're buying. If you're feeling lost, we do have a handy guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers for Android and iOS</a> to help you understand and make an informed decision.</p>
<h2 id="2-a-screen-protector-2">2. A screen protector</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hFWDTPqPPNAHrULjjeFz3d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-grey-one-ui-6-1-quick-toggles.jpg" alt="A look at the new quick toggle design in One UI 6.1 for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFWDTPqPPNAHrULjjeFz3d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know some people like to risk it all and use their phones in the nude. I think those people are stupid. Even a cheap $5 plastic screen protector or the free factory-installed film on your phone is better than using your phone without any protection.</p><p>Accidents happen; we are all human. The problem is not every phone company is going to replace your expensive 120Hz AMOLED screen for free. What's worse is that some brands don't even offer screen replacement at all, even if you have the money to pay for it. Why risk that?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">Screen protectors</a> are of mainly two types. You've got your sturdy tempered glass protectors with 9H hardness. These are great for shatter-proofing but not always case-friendly. They also don't play nice with curved displays.</p><p>The other sort is a plastic film, which is generally made of PET or TPU. If you're buying the fancy sort, it might even be a hybrid "glass-tic" mix like the kind offered by ZAGG. TPU and hybrid films are generally more durable. Films are thinner than glass, so you get a much better touch response. They can also self-heal small abrasions. However, you do not get hardy shatter-proofing or as robust drop protection for your phone's screen, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">choose wisely</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-a-phone-case-2">3. A phone case</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VUGVgPBEd4GGHJohdLxSFK" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-and-s24-plus-cases-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUGVgPBEd4GGHJohdLxSFK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3837" height="2158" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're planning on trading in your phone, it's a very smart idea to purchase a phone case to keep its body in mint condition. Another reason is to add friction. A lot of sleek and sexy-looking smartphones as very slippery. You can fix this problem and prevent accidental drops with the help a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases">decent case</a>, especially one that has scored or textured sides for added grip.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Phone cases</a> and covers are a dime a dozen. You can find all manner of phone cases, from thin, lightweight ones to thick, heavy-duty ones. Price isn't an issue for most devices unless you're looking to buy a case for a foldable phone.</p><p>Apart from the price, focus on the impact protection offered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-2024-cases">phone case</a> you're eyeing. Many case makers specify how many feet of drop protection their cases add, and some even go the extra mile by adding an antimicrobial layer that kills germs.</p>
<h2 id="4-a-pair-of-wireless-earbuds-2">4. A pair of wireless earbuds</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH" name="nothing-cmf-buds-2.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might be scoffing at this one, but let me tell you why you're wrong. Flagship and mid-range phones no longer have headphone jacks. So, what will you do when you want to listen to music privately or watch something in a public space? I'll tell you what you won't do: blast your tunes or play your video on your phone's speaker as people eye you on the subway or the local coffee shop.</p><p>Of course, you need a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">decent wireless earbuds</a> to go with your audio port-less phone. How else would you get audio playback delivered directly to your ears? The good news is that you don't need to shell out hundreds of dollars to get a good pair of earbuds. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-amazing-budget">CMF by Nothing Buds cost only $39</a>!</p>
<h2 id="5-a-magsafe-adapter-ring-2">5. A MagSafe adapter ring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WQxR9ykTZms2cR89RnXrod" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-spigen-magsafe-adapter.jpg" alt="Using the Spigen MagSafe ring on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQxR9ykTZms2cR89RnXrod.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am a firm believer that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">MagSafe adapter is the one ring to rule them all</a>. Forget smart rings, you can get this sticky magnetic adapter for any phone with the spare change in your pocket. But why is it an essential purchase? Let me explain.</p><p>Once you have all the basics like a screen protector and a phone case, you'll want more accessories a phone grip or a stand. A MagSafe adapter enables you to magnetically attach any accessory and detach it at will, whenever, wherever. It's a high level of convenience that cannot be attained otherwise.</p><p>Think about it. You don't need to fiddle with stupid arms on a car charger or stand anymore. Phone grips won't have to be adhesively attached to your phone case forever. And you can use wireless chargers without fear of the coils becoming misaligned. Getting a MagSafe adapter ring opens up a world of opportunities for your Android or older iOS device. You can use all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best MagSafe accessories</a> with it, whether they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> wireless car chargers, MagSafe phone grips, or magnetic wallet attachments.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't the end of the line when it comes to accessorizing and customizing your phone. You can get smartwatches, smart rings, power banks, and all sorts of extras to go with your phone. Some folks like buying kickstands and selfie-sticks. Others like Bluetooth accessories like speakers.</p><p>You can get as many additional gadgets and accessories as you want to go with your phone. However, anything else you get would be non-essential, at least in my books.</p>
