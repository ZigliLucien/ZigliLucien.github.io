Especially when you start watching or listening to something on your phone, but want to switch it over to a smart speaker or even the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>When attached to the Charging Speaker Dock, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> is essentially transformed into a supercharged Nest Hub Max. This includes things such as being able to add it to the Google Home app, while also unlocking the ability to cast music and videos to it.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-cast-music-and-videos-to-the-pixel-tablet"><span>How to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet</span></h3>
<p>Before you can cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet, there are a couple of requirements that first need to be met. These are no different than if you were trying to cast to something like the Nest Hub or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a>, so these shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>
<ul><li>Your Pixel Tablet must be connected to the Charging Speaker Dock.</li><li>Your phone and tablet must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</li></ul>
<p>1. Open the app that you're using to watch or listen to media on your phone.</p><p>2. Pick something to watch or listen to.</p><p>3. Locate and tap the <strong>Cast</strong> button within the app.</p><p>4. Select your <strong>Pixel Tablet</strong> from the list of options.</p><p>5. After a few moments, the content will begin playing on your Pixel Tablet.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-hold-close-to-cast"><span>How to use 'Hold close to cast'</span></h3>
<p>It's been almost two years, but Google is finally rolling out its "Hold close to cast" feature. This first debuted at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-media-across-devices">CES 2023</a>, however, it wasn't available until Google Play Services was updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-hold-close-to-cast-rollout-spotted">version 24.42.32</a> in October 2024.</p><p>However, it doesn't seem that this feature works for every phone out there, as it relies on Ultra Wideband. Currently, it supports Google's Pro lineup of phones, starting with the Pixel 6 Pro and including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Provided that your phone is updated with the latest version of Play Services, you'll need to first enable this feature.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app on your phone.</p><p>2. Scroll down and tap <strong>Google</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>All services</strong> tab.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.56%;"><img id="nxAgkTaExLG9KkNwau5kRc" name="How to enable 'Hold Close to cast'" alt="Steps to enable 'Hold Close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nxAgkTaExLG9KkNwau5kRc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Under <strong>Connected devices & sharing</strong>, tap <strong>Cast options</strong>.</p><p>5. Enable <strong>Hold phone close to cast</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="gV6MScrjbUXRx9q5oqfeRc" name="How to enable 'Hold Close to cast'" alt="Steps to enable 'Hold Close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gV6MScrjbUXRx9q5oqfeRc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you enable this option, being able to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet is pretty darn easy. All you need to do is open your media player of choice and pick something to watch or listen to.</p><p>Then, bring your phone close to the tablet until you feel your phone vibrate. A notification will appear at the top, letting you know that the media playback is being transferred to the Pixel Tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="T6EHFivqoqCdUER2HyXLic" name="How to use 'Hold close to cast' on Pixel phone" alt="How to use 'Hold close to cast' on Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T6EHFivqoqCdUER2HyXLic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once that's done, whatever media was playing on your phone, will now be playing on your Pixel Tablet!</p>
<h2 id="casting-made-easy-2">Casting made easy</h2>
<p>Curiously enough, while we are able to use this on the Pixel 9 Pro, it doesn't seem to be available on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones </a>just yet. The 'Hold close to cast' setting doesn't appear on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, nor is it available on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold running the latest Android 15 beta.</p><p>It's also worth pointing out that while this feature works with Spotify and YouTube, Google notes that "not all media apps work." So your mileage may vary depending on what app you're using to cast music and videos to the Pixel Tablet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest beta version (2.24.23.11) of WhatsApp on Android includes a shortcut in the chat bar that opens your gallery instantly, speeding up the media sharing process.</li><li>The new gallery shortcut simplifies sharing, and users can still record quick video messages by pressing and holding the button.</li><li>This feature is still in testing and is available to a limited number of WhatsApp Android beta users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is reportedly testing out a new feature to make sharing photos and videos a breeze by letting you jump straight into your gallery app.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>&apos;s newest beta (version 2.24.23.11) includes evidence of a new feature designed to make sharing media even easier. Now, there’s a shortcut right in the chat bar that opens your gallery instantly, making the whole process faster and smoother, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-23-11-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>.</p><p>At the moment, if you want to share something from your gallery on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, you&apos;ve got to go through either the camera icon or the attachment button, which pulls up a whole menu of options. The attachment option gives you a full menu with Gallery, Camera, Location, Contact, Document, Audio, Poll, and even the new AI-powered Imagine feature.</p><p>On the other hand, this dedicated gallery shortcut definitely makes sharing a bit easier. Plus, users can still send quick video messages by pressing and holding the button, so those who love recording on the fly won’t miss out on this key feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.08%;"><img id="CRhLDKuMYPVASveKZHdJef" name="Whatsapp-media-gallery-app.jpg" alt="WhatsApp media shortcut button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRhLDKuMYPVASveKZHdJef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="379" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Swapping the camera shortcut for the gallery icon might stir up some mixed feelings. It’s a nice perk for those who don’t often use their camera, but the catch is that you can’t just pop open the camera anymore. You’ll need to click the paperclip icon and pick the Camera option from there. So, if you&apos;re used to quickly grabbing and sending photos or videos, this change might not be your favorite.</p><p>At present, this feature is just in the testing phase, and only a handful of WhatsApp Android beta users can try it out. Based on how the feedback goes, the Meta-owned platform might decide to add the gallery shortcut to the chat bar for everyone—or keep it as is.</p>

Why watch the Warriors game on your flatscreen TV when you could (virtually) sit courtside and see your sports heroes up close as if you'd paid thousands to hang out with the celebs and venture capitalists?</p><p>On Saturday, I strapped on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, opened the Xtadium app, and transported myself to the Toyota Center in Houston for the Warriors-Rockets game, one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nba.com/news/2024-25-nba-vr-schedule">52 basketball games streamed in VR</a> for free for the 2025 season.</p><p>I had a blast...but I also didn't make it a full half. And not because the Warriors almost blew a 30-point lead!</p><p>Your typical TV broadcast uses an eagle-eyed view above the court, interspersed with close-ups of yelling coaches and slo-mo replays. But in VR, it's all about you "being there," so they place 360-degree cameras at center court and above each basketball hoop so you can look wherever you want, immersed in the action with the play-by-play commentary mixed with the actual sounds of the court.</p>

<p>At its best, NBA on Quest really does feel immersive. From the backboard cameras, you get close-up views of the players' faces and how they dance in patterns across the court to shake off pursuit, far better than you can from the usual top-down view. I wish Curry hadn't been injured for the game, but seeing my other faves splashing down 3s and bullying the Rockets on defense was fantastic.</p><p>But there's a reason why broadcasts default to a top-down view in arena sports: you need a wide, tall vantage to see the full flow of a game for fast breaks and long passes. And the default side-view camera for Xtadium broadcasts is weirdly low to the ground — probably to avoid blocking people behind it. You feel like a child staring up at giants from the floor.</p>

<p>There's a bigger problem: If you're close up on the action on one side and then there's a fast break, it's completely disorienting to suddenly jump to a courtside angle, then to the other hoop. There's no warning, so you jerk your neck left or right trying to re-find the dribbling player.</p><p>I missed a few highlights because of the hectic camera-warping, and I found myself watching the floating TV screen above the arena at times because it was easier to follow. That obviously defeats the whole purpose of basketball in VR!</p><p>Lastly, you have to accept that you're <em>not</em> at the arena; you're wearing a 1.1-pound headset for 2.5 hours, your eyes straining unless you add prescription lens inserts, and you're sitting alone. The Xtadium app lets you see your mixed-reality surroundings beside and behind you, but if you're sitting on a couch or in bed, all you're really seeing is that arena. When you're on the commercial break sitting and watching giveaways, cheerleaders, and other fan distractions without being able to talk to anyone, it's a bit lonely!</p><p>For all those reasons, I took the headset off before the half and switched to my local broadcast to give my tired eyes and twisting neck a break.</p>

<p>I know this goes against the usual broadcast strategy of curating what people see, but there's one obvious solution to make VR sporting events less hectic and more immersive: Give us camera control.</p><p>Let us point a controller or use hand tracking to select a back-court or side-court view at any time so we can decide which "seat" we're in at any given moment! That way, we can decide to stay in one spot (as if we really were at the game) or jump angles when <em>we're</em> ready for it, not when the broadcast team <em>thinks</em> we are.</p><p>I also think it should be easier to swap from the immersive courtside view to your mixed-reality living room at any moment, especially during commercial breaks! If you're at home watching the game, you'll want to check in on family, pets, or your phone without taking the headset fully off.</p><p>If Xtadium makes watching VR broadcasts less "traditional" and more interactive, then it would truly feel next-gen! As it is, I'll tune in again for the next Warriors game in VR — December 8 against the Timberwolves — to see Steph's antics up close, but I still don't think I'll last the whole game.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung’s One UI 7 might introduce an AI-driven notification summary feature, similar to Apple’s, starting with Korean language support.</li><li>Notification summaries could be limited to Samsung’s flagship models, possibly excluding Galaxy A series devices.</li><li>One UI 7’s beta release is expected by mid-November, with a new XJW build suggesting a major overhaul compared to earlier versions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor has it that Samsung’s upcoming One UI 7 update could introduce a fresh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> feature that takes a page from Apple’s Intelligence suite.</p><p>Tipster chunvn8888 recently revealed on X that Samsung’s One UI 7 beta (specifically the &apos;XJW&apos; build) is testing an AI-driven notification summary feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-ai-feature-apple-intelligence-3495674/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). At launch, though, it’s only available in Korean, as per the leaker.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy AI now has notification summary feature, it's called AI notification.<a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1852574436446306690">November 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Should Samsung move forward with this feature, we can probably expect more language options down the line. The leaker also hinted that notification summaries might stay exclusive to flagship devices, possibly leaving out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A series</a>.</p><p>Details on how this feature stacks up against Apple’s Intelligence summaries are still pretty sparse. But if it’s anything like Apple’s approach, it could help cut down notification overload by giving you quick, easy-to-read summaries of key information.</p><p>Apple’s AI tech does a great job of bundling tons of notifications into short, easy-to-skim summaries. This way, users can quickly catch the important points without getting bogged down by every single alert.</p><p>There are other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-android-15-update-gets-an-up-close-reveal-in-this-one-ui-7-hands-on-video">major One UI 7 updates</a> coming down the line. Rumor has it that Samsung’s next software upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">will bring in some iOS-inspired design elements</a>, like a dynamic island-style lock screen, a revamped Control Center, and smoother, iPhone-like animations. These big design updates could seriously upgrade the One UI 7 experience.</p><p>There’s no official word yet, but with One UI 7 already in testing, it’s clear Samsung is hard at work on this update. A beta release for Samsung users is expected to roll out before the end of the month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It will take another half month before Beta starts<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1852158438484382194">November 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>According to well-known leaker Ice Universe, the One UI 7 beta is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-android-15-beta-impending-arrival">expected to arrive by mid-November</a>. The leaker also mentioned that the new XJW build makes past leaks outdated, hinting at a major overhaul with more flexibility than previous versions.</p>

<ul><li>A rumor claims that Samsung may bring A/B update support for its Galaxy S25 series, making it the first flagship to do so.</li><li>The Galaxy A55 supports seamless updates, meaning users can continue to use their device while an update is downloaded on a separate partition.</li><li>Samsung's VP claimed in 2022 that the company wanted to do so for One UI 6; however, reality shows that it didn't happen.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung's next flagship series is rumored to adopt a new update method that Google pushed for with Android earlier this year.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1852203187975131597">Chunvn8888</a> posted on X that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could receive support for Android's A/B update method (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-seamless-updates-leak-3496340/">Android Authority</a>). This is good news considering Samsung's flagship series has consistently ignored this new update method.</p><p>The tipster notes that the only Samsung phone to receive A/B support is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55</a>, which launched in March.</p>

<p>In February, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-may-only-support-seamless-updates">pushed <em>all </em>OEMs</a> to adopt the A/B (seamless) update method on Android. It was discovered in the AOSP that the company planned to remove support for non-A/B updates. This was seen as the (hopeful) nudge Samsung needed to bring A/B support to its flagships — and it might work.</p><p>If the rumors are true, Galaxy S25 users can continue using their device as it updates using a separate partition. An active partition runs in the background, grabbing the update's information before slotting it into an <em>inactive </em>partition. This is done without disrupting the user's activities.</p><p>However, once completed, the prompt to restart appears, and the device will briefly refresh as it switches to that once-inactive partition with the update.</p><p>Take this rumor cautiously as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-working-on-seamless-updates-one-ui-6">Samsung's VP once claimed</a> the company wanted to introduce the A/B method for devices through One UI 6. It's unclear what the hang-up was, but reality shows that the Galaxy S23 <em>did not </em>debut with seamless updates.</p><p>What's more, Google implemented a fix for its seamless updates last year, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-phones-system-updates-install-now-faster">made them much faster</a>. Regardless, Samsung confirmed during its Q3 2024 earnings call that it plans to launch the Galaxy S25 series "in the first half of next year." With that, the company plans to continue to innovate and upgrade its on-device Galaxy AI experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly rolling out an update for Pixel Screenshots that cleans up its UI experience across multiple levels.</p><p>The company is rolling out a major change to its Pixel Screenshots UI on its home screen that drops the "All Screenshots" section. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/04/pixel-screenshots-update/">9to5Google</a>, the update (v0.24.373.08) promotes better organization and clarity when searching your saved photos. The publication notes that with the "All Screenshots" portion gone, the home screen receives horizontal organization via four, three, or two block rows.</p><p>Each option (from four to two) offers an increasingly larger preview window for the screenshot.</p><p>Following this update, users tapping on a screenshot will notice a vastly condensed details page. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> uses AI-generated descriptions to describe what the photo entails and other important details for rediscovery. The app can also save crucial dates to your Google Calendar if enabled. However, the post states this update makes these details smaller in an expandable box. The publication notes that this was likely done to give users quicker access to its notes and "add to collection" fields.</p><p>This change will likely aid users in taking screenshots <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9#:~:text=I%20tend%20to%20take%20screenshots%20of%20billing%20details">of billing information</a> or longer pieces of important text.</p>

<p>The update includes an option for users to long-press the Pixel Screenshots app icon with options to "take a photo" or "add image" from your phone's home screen.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post notes that Collections now display a "+" icon, the new button for adding screenshots. This replaces the old "select screenshots" option that would fit horizontally at the top of a Collection. Additionally, the old trash icon is gone, replaced by a vertical three-dot menu with the edit and delete buttons inside.</p><p>The publication states these updates are rolling out to more devices.</p><p>The Pixel Screenshots app was recently rumored to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-development-spotted">pick up closer integration</a> with Circle to Search. The latter lets users circle or highlight an area that they want the AI to search for through Google Search. However, a recent APK teardown showed the company might let users "save" those highlights to Pixel Screenshots. An early splash page states "Remember what you find. Save to Screenshots."</p><p>Google's October feature drop held an update for Pixel Screenshots that introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">its Gemini extension</a>. Users could say "Hey Google" and instruct it to use their collection of screenshots to find information about a specific brand of shoe and more. Once it finds the answer, the company explains that the AI will display the screenshot.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon launched several updated Kindles in mid-October and among them is its first full-color e-reader, which has hit a snag.</p><p>Over the weekend, Amazon reportedly informed customers who purchased the Kindle Colorsoft that its delivery would be suspended. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-shipping-is-cancelled">GoodEReader</a>, the company is delaying all shipments of its color e-reader by "a week or more." The publication states Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft encountered a problem with its display that caused a "yellowish bar" to appear at the bottom of its display.</p><p>Amazon is only now becoming aware of the problem after users took to its product page to leave several negative reviews. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft-Signature-Edition/dp/B0CN3XR57P/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QKIL4ZBMLUUF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P5alACszJGWI08LQyFpcaECTbDiyKdUlS2r4MtXnriM5X-N98snwr96RKSBfA8e8jZeHxEQ6Ed55zjLewBwn_bz-hCU9n4A12gGjpsUygxa6DjGm5XA-2IHmZK2ex8bKnIotFovXLRRd9S5ageGDc-iI2TFCADAr2_HNM2OJ51XF19DRkP656Fm01SydMa56yxfx2yJiG13MFWSS03eST1BooAudr-btUUmerw1IVO8.O0QK3IPJwkpZfue0MIfrEPGV9Vuwrk3KDdPHhLWC46g&dib_tag=se&keywords=kindle%2Bcolorsoft&qid=1730746703&sprefix=kindle%2Bcolor%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1&ufe=INHOUSE_INSTALLMENTS%3AUS_IHI_5M_DEVICES&th=1#:~:text=The%20bottom%205%2D10%25%20of%20the%20screen%20is%20slightly%20yellowish">user's review claims</a> that the yellowish bar takes up "5-10%" of the bottom of their display. The trend continued as several more reviews brought up the strange yellow stripe as users bombarded the Colorsoft e-reader's page.</p><p>Amazon confirmed its recent actions to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286289/kindle-colorsoft-yellow-bar-display-e-reader">The Verge</a>. The company's spokesperson, Jill Tornifoglio stated, "we’re aware of a small number of reports from customers who see a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously and are looking into it. If customers notice this on their device, they can reach out to our customer service team."</p><p>Additionally, Dark mode was originally listed as one of the e-reader's features; however, Amazon has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft-Signature-Edition/dp/B0CN3XR57P/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QKIL4ZBMLUUF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P5alACszJGWI08LQyFpcaECTbDiyKdUlS2r4MtXnriM5X-N98snwr96RKSBfA8e8jZeHxEQ6Ed55zjLewBwn_bz-hCU9n4A12gGjpsUygxa6DjGm5XA-2IHmZK2ex8bKnIotFovXLRRd9S5ageGDc-iI2TFCADAr2_HNM2OJ51XF19DRkP656Fm01SydMa56yxfx2yJiG13MFWSS03eST1BooAudr-btUUmerw1IVO8.O0QK3IPJwkpZfue0MIfrEPGV9Vuwrk3KDdPHhLWC46g&dib_tag=se&keywords=kindle+colorsoft&qid=1730746703&sprefix=kindle+color%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1&ufe=INHOUSE_INSTALLMENTS%3AUS_IHI_5M_DEVICES#:~:text=product%20or%20seller-,We%20Want%20You%20To%20Know,-Dark%20Mode%20is">included a note</a> on the product's page stating it's not working.

The issue with the Colorsoft's display seems widespread, but Amazon told users that it's working on a patch to solve the problem, indicating it could be a software issue.</p>

<p>Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-colorsoft-signature-edition-launch-details">the Kindle Colorsoft</a> on October 16 alongside the new Kindle Scribe, Paperwhite, and base model. The Colorsoft is its first full-color e-reader rocking a 7-inch display and a custom coating to enhance its visuals. Amazon stated in a press release that the Colorsoft features two modes: "standard" and "vibrant" colors to improve its experience.</p><p>Aside from 32GB of storage, the Kindle Colorsoft received note-taking features like text highlighting, a zoom function for images, and more. Per the company's post, the device started shipping on October 30. However, in light of recent events, Amazon has suspended all Kindle Colorsoft shipments until it can work out a solution.</p><p>While we're likely waiting on a software update, Amazon has not said <em>when </em>users can expect this to rollout.</p>

<p><em><strong>Chris asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Is there anything I can do to get better battery life on my Galaxy Watch 6? I hate that it needs charging before the end of the day or when I'm not at home.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Chris. Great choice in a watch — my wife buys last year's Galaxy Watch model every year and saves a bunch of money while still having something that is new for her. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is really nice.</p><p>She also has to charge it every day around dinnertime because it just can't seem to keep up with her all day long. There is some good news, though: you can shut off or not use in order to get the most out of the battery.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember is that your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> is a small, wearable, power-hungry computer with a tiny power source. Super-long battery life is never going to be a thing with a smartwatch and the best we should expect is for it to last between regular charge cycles. What I mean is that you should expect to charge your watch at the same time every day and it should last that long every day, regardless of what you were doing.</p><p>And from what I see, we're mostly there. Not counting the random days when something gets "stuck" running and eats your battery or days where it's counting a bajillion steps because you're at Disney World, you probably only have to charge it once per day. You shouldn't expect more from the current generation of technology inside of them. One day it will change, but we're not there yet.</p><p>The other thing to remember is that the more you do, the sooner your battery will die. Take my watch — a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> — as an example. I get four days or more between charges but Garmin watches aren't the same as a WearOS watch and other than fitness tracking they really fall behind when it comes to the "smart" stuff. An old Casio watch that only tells time gets about 10 years of life from a battery. Your Galaxy Watch can do all sorts of things that will eat your battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kDYqMi4ND2BWE6ELFWo3Hb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-hands-on-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch on a charging stand at the Google Fall 2022 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDYqMi4ND2BWE6ELFWo3Hb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough explaining why we have to charge so often and time to start talking about what we can do to make battery life better.</p><p>Number one on the list is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-apps">apps you have installed</a>. Most every app you have will randomly start up to do something once in a while even if you're not using it. Some apps run constantly. This eats away at your battery; sometimes just a little bit and other times a lot more. If you don't use an app, uninstall it. It will always be there if you decide to use it again.</p><p>Number two is the display. Mind the brightness setting so that it's bright enough to see without being some sort of beacon. Having it too bright does nothing except eat your battery. You can also shut off the always-on display and make sure the screen time-out setting isn't too long.</p><p>Next is your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-watch-face-wear-os">watch face</a>. You can avoid displays with a seconds indicator or a lot of complications you don't use to get a real boost to your battery life. One with a black background will also save battery. The less your watch face has to refresh itself, the longer your battery will last.</p>
<p>There are some more drastic things you can do, too. These make your watch a bit less smart but they can have a significant effect on how long your battery lasts so you might want to use them from time to time.</p><p>Shut off the features you don't absolutely need. I'm talking about things like GPS or vibration or even Wi-Fi and you'll see a real gain in battery life. Bedtime mode also saves battery at the expense of using some features.</p><p>Use power saving mode or "watch only" mode in a pinch to stretch things out to the maximum.</p><p>These things can come in handy if you're out later than usual or doing something like camping where charging is pretty inconvenient.</p>
<hr>
<p>We're probably never going to be satisfied with the battery life on our watch. It does get better every year but we end up doing more and cancel it out.</p><p>These tips will help a little but the best advice is to carry a spare charger and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">battery pack</a> if you have to have your watch doing its thing and won't be home to charge it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Mishaal Rahman has shared some interesting details about developments coming to Android's popular Quick Share feature.</li><li>Recent code from the app has indicated the possibility of the feature coming to iOS and macOS.</li><li>Rahman notes that the code findings have surfaced as part of a bug fix.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Quick Share is a widely popular tool for Android devices, Chromebooks, and Windows devices. While the latter received the functionality fairly recently, Mishaal Rahman says it might expand to Apple devices, too.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/quick-share-for-ios-macos-rumor-3496057/">Android Authority</a>, Rahman has shared his latest findings, revealing the possibility of Google bringing its popular file-sharing tool to devices running on Apple devices.</p><p>For starters, Rahman explains that Quick Share is built on the search giant's popular Nearby Share API, the source code of which is generally available on GitHub under the Nearby repository.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZpP5rkrR9rSC9cLxsEmKM5" name="Quick-share-tablet.jpg" alt="Quick share tile on a tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpP5rkrR9rSC9cLxsEmKM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is believed that the repository is constantly updated to introduce backend features and occasionally fix bugs, which is usually done by engineers at Google. One such case has hinted at a bug fix involving iOS and macOS devices. The engineer rolled out the fix, and according to their comments, the bug fix apparently "benefits Quick Share on iOS and macOS," notes Rahman.</p><p>Although Google has yet to launch its file-sharing client on the said devices, the engineer's comment raises speculation about the possibility of Quick Share debuting on iOS and macOS handsets and computers. Rahman indicates that it could be the groundwork for bringing the feature soon or a random bug fix.</p><p>A launch on Apple devices wouldn't be as surprising as it sounds, and should only make shifting things between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and Apple devices much more effortless, given the lack of AirDrop support on Android.</p>
<p>Quick Share has become a significant tool for file sharing between Android phones and across platforms. Google previously had a Nearby Share client for Android handsets, while Samsung Galaxy phones had Quick Share—an in-house developed by the Korean tech giant that used to work effectively only between Galaxy handsets.</p><p>However, as part of the collaboration, Samsung and Google chose to merge their efforts into one service, and thus, Quick Share has become the default sharing tool between devices.</p><p>On the contrary, Apple has AirDrop to share files across its devices. It will be interesting to see Android phones and Apple devices unite with the launch of the anticipated Quick Share, as it would become a more ubiquitous method for sharing files, just like how these devices now share the USB-C standard. That said, it's unclear, if Quick Share were to launch on Apple devices, how it would be implemented, and if iPhone/Mac owners would actually bother using it.</p>
