<ul><li>WhatsApp is letting you share longer voice notes in status updates, up to one minute instead of the previous 30 seconds.</li><li>To use the new one-minute voice note feature, make sure to update your app from the Play Store or App Store.</li><li>The update allows users to share longer and more meaningful moments, making it ideal for events and announcements.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> is introducing a new feature that allows users to share longer voice notes in their status updates.</p><p>This isn&apos;t entirely new territory, as testing for extended voice messages began a few years back. Earlier this year, we got a taste of it with 30-second voice recordings. But now, thanks to the keen eyes at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-voice-status-updates-up-to-1-minute-long/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>, we know that this feature has been upgraded to support voice messages up to a minute in status updates.</p><p>After updating to the latest version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a> on both Android and iOS, WABetaInfo discovered that voice notes are now limited to a minute each, doubling the previous 30-second limit. This update also applies to status updates, enabling users to share longer voice messages with a wider audience, albeit temporarily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:422px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.73%;"><img id="yfp8o93pDbxmr6P4wNKKs6" name="Whatsapp-voice-status-updates.jpg" alt="Longer voice notes in whatsapp status updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yfp8o93pDbxmr6P4wNKKs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="422" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this new limit, those who favor sending voice messages to avoid lengthy typing can now share a few longer recordings instead of multiple short clips.</p><p>One of the biggest annoyances with WhatsApp status was the short duration of voice notes. The new update changes offer users the flexibility to share longer moments and stories with their friends and family.</p><p>However, WABetaInfo notes that you&apos;ll need to update the app to send one-minute voice messages. It&apos;s not just a server-side change, so be sure to check for WhatsApp updates to get the latest features right away.</p><p>To record a voice note, just hold down the mic button, just like you do in chats. If you change your mind, you can slide to cancel the recording.</p><p>The new feature allowing longer videos on WhatsApp status is perhaps one of the most requested capabilities, letting users share more meaningful clips. This update is perfect for events, announcements, or any moments that need more than the previous 30-second limit to be fully captured.</p><p>In addition to longer voice notes, WhatsApp is working on more features for status updates, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-status-updates-tray">larger preview windows in the status updates tray</a>, at least for Android users.</p>

While it&apos;s a little bulky for most to use for sleep monitoring, it still has all the sleep, fitness, and health features users typically want in a smartwatch.

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is one of the more expensive Android smartwatches out there, so $250 off the sticker price on the LTE version makes this a pretty incredible deal. With up to three days of battery life per charge, swift charging, and smooth performance, this watch is well worth the discounted price.</p>
<p>Some find it a little bulkier than they'd prefer, so it probably isn't our top pick for wearing while you sleep. Still, it's a good watch, and it seems especially appealing at this price if you want LTE with your smartwatch.</p>

<p><strong>âRecommended if:Â </strong>you&apos;re looking for a watch that has top-notch battery life; you like the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem, but the high price tag of the Watch 5 Pro was holding you back.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if: </strong>you want a particularly lightweight watch that you can easily wear during sleep; the temperature sensor is a major selling point for you.</p><p>We&apos;ve named the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best premium Android smartwatch</a>, and there&apos;s a reason why.

The temperature sensor has also been known to be inaccurate. Still, the battery life and premium features make the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro worthwhile for most, even at its normal selling price.</p>

<p>Logitech is one of the big names in computer peripherals, mice, and keyboards included. So it&apos;s no wonder that a Logitech keyboard ended up being our favorite. The Logitech K480 keyboard combines a great typing experience with multiple connectivity options and portability for the best on-the-go experience. Your Android tablet wasn&apos;t designed to sit on a desk. It was designed as a mobile device and your keyboard should go along with it. But the keyboard experience doesn&apos;t have to stop at just your tablet.</p>
<p>With the rotating dial switch, the Logitech K480 keyboard can connect to any of three different devices which means you get the same keyboard on whatever device you want. Switch between your computer at home, your tablet on the go, and your laptop at work. Having the same keyboard everywhere will just make you that much more productive. Plus, Logitech&apos;s Flow technology allows you to pair up a compatible mouse and you can type, copy, paste, and move files between devices, which is pretty powerful.</p>
<p>It&apos;s a little on the small side, sacrificing size for portability, so it may not be an ideal desktop typing experience. For example, there is no number pad on the right. But for a tablet, this is the right size and you get a slot to hold your tablet upright. On top of that, the affordable accessory is spill-resistant too. The only thing that is missing is a rechargeable battery. The batteries are standard AAA batteries, so they&apos;re easy and cheap to replace and they last an estimated two years.</p>

<p>The Anker Compact Wireless Keyboard is an absolute steal for the price, averaging at around $11 to $15 at most retailers. This charming bargain might not have a full keyboard with a number pad, but it can still connect to three devices simultaneously.</p><p>Aside from its delightfully low price tag, the Anker Compact Wireless Keyboard also comes with a really cool feature in the form of its built-in two-in-one stand. You can use the stand to raise the keyboard itself or prop up your tablet and another device like a phone if you want. Like most Bluetooth keyboards for Android tablets and phones, you can connect to three devices simultaneously and switch between them using keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>This also uses AAA batteries, so it&apos;s not rechargeable, but the batteries are easily replaced and available anywhere you can buy batteries.</p>

<p>Logitech slays across the board when it comes to peripherals. The brand has something to offer for every kind of user. If you&apos;re the sort who likes to use one Bluetooth keyboard with everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, the Logitech K400 Plus is the most versatile keyboard you can buy.</p><p>Not only do you get Bluetooth connectivity with native support for Android and iOS, but you also get support for Chrome OS, Windows, macOS, iPadOS, and smart TVs. This jack-of-all Bluetooth keyboard is a stellar investment across the board. Since it&apos;s powered by two AAA batteries, you can expect them to last around two years before they need replacement.</p>

<p>This is another Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech that supports Android, iOS, and Windows tablets. The Logitech Universal Folio is a universal keyboard case with Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity.</p><p>As long as your tablet is between 9 inches to 10 inches wide, it can easily fit the Logitech Universal Folio. Unfortunately, this makes it incompatible with larger tabs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. The case protects your tablet when folded and it has a stand to prop your tab up, laptop style. It even includes a stylus holder so you can store your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">tab&apos;s S Pen or whatever stylus</a> you&apos;re using in it.</p><p>For charging, the Logitech Universal Folio uses two CR2032 cells. These are easily replaceable but you won&apos;t have to worry about that for at least a year or two.</p>

It&apos;s not the most portable or affordable Bluetooth keyboard for your tablet, but it sure is one of the most solid and fun ones out there.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for the ultimate in portability, the Samsers Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard might be best for you. The name is a bit cringe, but the keyboard itself is solid. It has a metal casing with sturdy ABS plastic hinges that may emote a cheap feeling, but the keyboard itself is great. It&apos;s a tri-fold keyboard that gets nice and small when closed.</p><p>Thanks to the keyboard&apos;s Scissor Switch keys, it is designed to be quiet when typing and the quality of the keys is fabulous for the price. You can purchase various variants of the Samsers Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard, depending on your needs. This includes bright color options as well as Bluetooth 3.0 and newer Bluetooth 5.0 iterations of the foldable keyboard.</p><p>The Samsers Bluetooth Keyboard supports Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Our favorite feature after it&apos;s foldability is its USB-C charging port. That&apos;s right, you don&apos;t need to worry about getting triple A batteries for this keyboard, you can top it up with your own Android tablet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">Type-C charger</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-an-external-keyboard-for-android-2">What to look for in an external keyboard for Android</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of great Android tablets out there. Maybe you just picked up a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra which we called the best Android tablet money can buy. But finding a great typing experience to go along with it that&apos;s compact and portable can be a challenge. That&apos;s why we went with the Logitech K380 keyboard. It has a great typing experience, and is ultra-portable, and isn&apos;t limited to just your tablet.</p>
<p>At the core of your tablet experience is portability, which is why we mostly picked portable keyboards. If your situation differs, we have options for you too. A desktop experience can also be great on your Android tablet. But for a combination of all of those together, you can't go wrong with Logitech.</p>

In theory, being able to set up and use eSIM on Android offers more flexibility. However, getting things up and running isn&apos;t as easy as just popping out a physical SIM card and swapping it over to a new phone.Â </p><p>Here&apos;s everything you need to know about eSIM and how to get one on your Android phone</p>
<h2 id="what-is-esim-2">What is eSIM?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4273px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="WzFUXy5DtfRHDbAjGqHoyD" name="visible-esim-compatible-android-laptop-close.jpg" alt="Visible phone compatibility web page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WzFUXy5DtfRHDbAjGqHoyD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4273" height="2404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIM</a>, you are essentially downloading all of the necessary carrier data directly to your phone. Previously, this was primarily handled by a physical SIM card provided by the carrier. However, as phones have continued to mature and improve, so has the reliability and versatility of using an eSIM.Â </p><p>One of the best reasons to use an eSIM is that you <em>shouldn&apos;t</em> need to go into a physical store to activate your phone. You can do it from wherever you are, provided that you have a stable Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Another benefit of using an eSIM on Android is the option to use multiple phone numbers on a single device. This is great if you are traveling abroad and don&apos;t want to incur roaming fees, as you can simply turn off the physical SIM connectivity and rely solely on the eSIM.Â </p><p>Thankfully, we haven&apos;t seen any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> ditch the physical SIM card slot. However, the same can&apos;t be said for the iPhone, as Apple removed this option starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14</a>.Â </p>

<p>By and large, setting up and starting to use eSIM on Android is a fairly straightforward process. If you purchase a phone from a carrier, then most of the legwork is already done for you. All you&apos;ll need to do is turn off your old phone, turn on your new phone, and go through the initial setup process.Â </p><p>However, if you already have a phone (or purchased one unlocked), you&apos;ll need to find a carrier, make sure your phone is compatible, and sign up for a plan. Whether it&apos;s because you&apos;re switching to a new carrier with your old phone or want to move your existing number to a different phone, we&apos;ve got you covered.</p>

<p>After making its debut at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-esim-migration-tool">MWC 2023</a>, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-letting-you-transfer-esims-between-phones">eSIM Transfer Tool</a> is finally available. Meanwhile, Samsung introduced an eSIM transfer tool of its own with One UI 5.1. Unfortunately, not every phone maker or carrier is onboard with offering the ability to transfer an eSIM just yet. However, we hope that will change as pretty much every phone from the past few years includes an eSIM.Â </p><p>Here&apos;s how to transfer your eSIM from one Android device to another.</p>
<p>1. Go through the steps above for either your Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy device.</p><p>2. If using a Pixel, tap the <strong>Transfer a SIM from another device</strong> button on the <strong>Connect to mobile network </strong>screen.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-benefits-and-headaches-to-using-an-esim-2">There are benefits, and headaches to using an eSIM</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9e2w2YqSQzsCFs5paEPaMi" name="iphone-14-pro-max-review-5.jpg" alt="iPhone 14 Pro Max next to Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9e2w2YqSQzsCFs5paEPaMi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While touted for its versatility and ease of use, not everything is rosy in the world of using an eSIM. For instance, if you have an iPhone 14 or iPhone 15, are using an eSIM, and want to switch to an Android phone, the process is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">a pain in the neck</a>. Even with Google or Samsung&apos;s built-in eSIM transfer tools, the process will likely result in you needing to call your carrier or go into a store.</p><p>But as already stated, there are plenty of benefits to using eSIM, and things should only get better as support for the tech improves.</p>

<hr>
<p>iFixit, a company that has tried to advance the right-to-repair movement by partnership with big tech manufacturers, announced last week that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">it is ending its collaboration with Samsung</a>. The partnership allowed iFixit to distribute official parts and create repair guides for Samsung devices. However, iFixit cut off the deal, saying that Samsung&apos;s "approach to repairability does not align with our mission."</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to unpack here, because iFixit&apos;s decision to back out of the Samsung partnership could have a big effect on consumers. iFixit is the go-to source for reliable original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket parts, as well as tools and repair guides, for a swath of consumer electronics products. Is iFixit or Samsung to blame for the breakup? That&apos;s not completely clear, but both sides weren&apos;t perfect. Samsung didn&apos;t set the partnership up for success, and iFixit won&apos;t produce repair guides for Samsung devices <em>at all</em> now that it&apos;s over.Â </p><p>Regardless of what you think about Samsung and iFixit&apos;s role in the partnership ending, there&apos;s an uninvolved third party that is sitting pretty through all the drama: Google.</p><p>While companies like Samsung may seemingly be uninterested in truly supporting Right to Repair, Google&apos;s approach seems genuine. It&apos;s providing parts and guides as part of its own iFixit partnership, supporting Right to Repair legislation, and more. Samsung&apos;s apparent lack of interest in Right to Repair shows that Google certainly doesn&apos;t have to do all it has done to make repairing Pixels easier and deserves more credit.Â </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don&apos;t know the entire story of how the collaboration between iFixit and Samsung fell apart. iFixit shared some of its side of the story in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration" target="_blank">blog post</a> and a subsequent interview between the company&apos;s CEO and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24162135/ifixit-end-samsung-repair-parts-deal" target="_blank">The Verge</a>. Android Central reached out to Samsung regarding iFixit&apos;s canceled partnership when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">we first covered it last week</a>, but we still have not heard back from the company.</p><p>Even without the additional context, it&apos;s not hard to see why the partnership called the Samsung Repair Hub didn&apos;t work out. Samsung imposed some arbitrary limitations that prevented individual consumers and companies from performing cost-effective repairs. One of the more egregious examples was a Samsung policy that barred iFixit from selling more than seven parts to a customer over a three-month period. This effectively prohibited independent repair shops from benefiting from the deal.Â </p><p>The other big issue was that Samsung bundled parts together, making repairs cost-prohibitive. For example, to replace the battery on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-ultra-aged-better-than-pixel-6">Samsung Galaxy S22</a>, users would have to pay iFixit a whopping $160 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s22-usa-screen-and-battery-genuine?variant=40009041805415" target="_blank">new part</a>. Why? Because Samsung only sells new phone batteries that are pre-attached to a brand-new screen. This is extremely problematic for a few reasons. If you just need to replace a battery, not only are you paying for a screen you didn&apos;t need, but you&apos;re also throwing away a perfectly good display in the process.Â </p><p>There were probably financial reasons that contributed to the demise of the iFixit and Samsung collaboration, too. For the reasons above, it didn&apos;t make sense for people to buy parts from iFixit, and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if sales were low.Â </p>
<h2 id="is-ifixit-bitter-2">Is iFixit bitter?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7QDMhBkrTQYH9KshUvrYrL" name="Fairphone-5-iFixit.jpg" alt="A Fairphone 5 being opened from iFixit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7QDMhBkrTQYH9KshUvrYrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Fairphone 5 being opened by iFixit. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iFixit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>iFixit doesn&apos;t appear to be completely innocent through all this either, and I think it&apos;s fair to wonder whether the company is bitter following the Samsung breakup. Moving forward, iFixit has decided not to make its own repair guides for Samsung products.Â </p><p>"As Samsung phones are popular devices, weâve tried to cover them with our in-house repair guides. But as the devices continued to decline in repairability, it made less and less sense," iFixit explained. "Having repair guides is a crucial part of repairability, but if Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work, do they really deserve that credit? We will be turning our limited guide-making bandwidth onto more deserving tech."Â </p><p>The word choice here is interesting because iFixit alleges that "Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work." But if iFixit&apos;s main goal was to empower people to repair their own devices and help out independent shops, why is it so focused on the finances of creating repair guides? Samsung is one of the largest phone manufacturers in the world, usually trading places as the leader or runner-up in phones sold. The company shipped over 226 million phones in 2023, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276477/global-market-share-held-by-samsung-smartphones/#:~:text=As%20the%20overall%20smartphone%20market,of%20all%20smartphone%20shipments%20worldwide." target="_blank">Statista</a>, so it&apos;s incredibly disappointing that iFixit seemingly has no interest in helping users repair those devices anymore.</p><p>iFixit wants to make it seem like it doesn&apos;t need to make repair guides for Samsung products, saying that "anyone can make an iFixit guideâin fact, over half of our 100,000+ guides were not written by our in-house team." However, iFixit does make in-house repair guides for plenty of popular products made by companies it does not partner with, including Apple. It seems puzzling that a company claiming to be "pushing the envelope and pulling all the levers we can to make repair universal" would give up on making repair guides for Samsung devices.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s an innocent party in the iFixit/Samsung fiasco. Samsung should have done more to make the Samsung Repair Hub a viable option for independent repairers, and iFixit should keep making repair guides for Samsung products. But if there&apos;s one company that looks good through all this, it&apos;s Google.Â </p><p>For its part, Google partnered with iFixit a few years ago and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backed a Right-to-Repair bill in Oregon</a> earlier this year. There aren&apos;t any "catches" to Google&apos;s partnership with iFixit, either. You can buy an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/google-pixel-8-pro-battery-genuine?variant=40272894230631&pk_campaign={PMax:US|Shopping|SSC|FixKits|}&pk_source=google&pk_medium=cpc&pk_kwd=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwu8uyBhC6ARIsAKwBGpQl5z14YmIZEZdusJ2a4Q462QLNfaqzcjRvvc_hlZfd8al3fUunaxwaAluxEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Pixel 8 Pro battery</a> from iFixit, plus all the parts and tools needed to complete the repair, for just $50.Â </p><p>Google clearly embraces the right-to-repair mission, as evidenced by the company&apos;s words and actions. In a recent episode of the Made by Google podcast, Steven Nickel, the director of consumer hardware operations at Google, talked about the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-wants-to-design-pixel-phones-to-be-repairable-without-special-tools">plan to make Pixel devices more repairable</a>. To say that Nickel&apos;s words make me optimistic about the future of repairing Google devices would be an understatement.</p><p>The goal for Pixel repairability is to make fixing the devices a "fixture-less" repair, he explained.Â "Fixtures are the tools you need to repair them," Nickel added. "We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen."</p><p>Words are just thatâwords, but Google&apos;s actions over the about two years of the iFixit partnership prove it&apos;s actually committed to Right-to-Repair. And as the deterioration of the iFixit/Samsung partnership shows, that isn&apos;t a given. Google is doing some good work when it comes to repairability and deserves praise for it.Â </p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 10 series is likely to be powered by Tensor chips made by TSMC and not Samsung.</li><li>New obtained database information by Android Authority seemingly confirms the Tensor G5 (Laguna codenamed) chipset manufacturers.</li><li>Additionally, the Pixel 10 series could finally feature 16GB of RAM as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While the Pixel 9 is the next anticipated series from Google, new information already gives exciting details about the successor Pixel 10 series, specifically the chipset that will be powering those models.</p><p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">rumored</a> that Google is ditching Samsung for its in-house developed Tensor G5 chip, which likely powers the Pixel 10 series. However, new findings from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tsmc-tensor-g5-proof-pixel-10-3445056/">Android Authority</a> indicate that TSMC will be producing the upcoming Tensor G5 chip and not Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:976px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.48%;"><img id="JwJndyz7qAAqXy32tRpCp6" name="Tensor-G5-TSMC-leak.jpg" alt="Tensor G5 by TSMC database leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwJndyz7qAAqXy32tRpCp6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="976" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication obtained publicly available trade databases that add evidence to the earlier predicted rumors. The databases indicate the companies that ordered goodsâGoogle (as Shipper) and Tessolve Semiconductor (as Consignee) are mentionedâand the description of the goods gives us away some additional details.</p><p>The description broken down by the publication reveals the Google part number, chip&apos;s code name "laguna (LGA)," goods&apos; type, packing type, manufacturer, and the number of tests the mentioned chipset has passed. TSMC is evidently mentioned as the manufacturer, and the packaging technology is InFO POP, which is believed to be associated exclusively with TSMC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1028px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.37%;"><img id="TVhZDBP2SsF6jw7wJGa4f6" name="Tensor-G5-TSMC-leak-01.jpg" alt="Tensor G5 by TSMC database leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TVhZDBP2SsF6jw7wJGa4f6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1028" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by the Android Authority report, the other parameters mentioned indicate that Google is still testing the new chip, and it is expected to be at least 16 months away from the official release, which aligns with the Pixel 10 series lineup. The database further mentions the RAM capacity of 16GB, which is an interesting detail to look forward to as it is a significant bump from the current model&apos;s RAM capacity.Â </p><p>For the uninitiated, the current Tensor chips, including the upcoming Tensor G4 powering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, are co-developed by Google and Samsung, which has been the case since the first Tensor chip in 2021.Â </p><p>Parting ways from Samsung suggests Google is gaining more control over its Tensor chips, similar to what Apple does with A and M series chips. It also means that the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-needs-to-avoid-iphone-15-thermal-issues">thermal problems</a> on Tensor-powered Pixel chips might eventually be resolved and could lead to better overall performance, although we&apos;ll have to wait to see these chips in action to gauge the improvements.</p>

In fact, you may have already been using it as the default messaging app for Android and Wear OS devices. Effectively Googleâs answer to Appleâs iMessage service, Google Messages can leverage instant messaging, SMS, and RCS.Â </p><p>While Google Messages, formerly called Android Messages, has technically been around for the last decade, there have been some notable upgrades. Rich Communication Services (RCS), for example, was added along with end-to-end encryption. Most recently, Google Messages has been enhanced to function akin to other instant messaging services (think WhatsApp and Signal) so you can do things like start group chats, send emoji reactions, and more.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-send-messages-over-wi-fi-data-with-rcs"><span>Send messages over Wi-Fi/data with RCS</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg" name="Google-Messages-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS Chat features on a Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the RCS Chat feature in Google Messages, you can send free messages over Wi-Fi using data, ideal if you donât have an active cellular connection, like if you have turned off cellular while traveling and youâre relying on Wi-Fi alone. Itâs pretty simple to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">enable RCS Chat in Google Messages</a>.Â </p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Go to <strong>Settings</strong> by selecting your profile icon on the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>RCS chats</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap the slider beside <strong>Turn on RCS chats</strong> to the right to turn it on.</p><p>6. You may be asked to <strong>Verify your number</strong>.</p>
<p>Since RCS messaging requires having a phone number, you canât set this up on a phone that youâre using in Wi-Fi mode only without a SIM card, like a device you have given to an older child to use. Without an active cellular number, RCS messaging wonât work. But with one, itâs a great way to continue messaging when you turn off cellular data while roaming or want to conserve your limited amount of voice calling minutes or SMS.Â </p><p>Itâs also a better alternative to SMS, as with any other instant messaging service, since your messages are sent instantly with confirmation of receipt and you can have a seamless conservation with not just one but multiple people. Thereâs also end-to-end encryptions with RCS messaging, as long as the person with whom your messaging is using RCS Chat as well.Â </p><p>RCS messaging has been available in the U.S. as well as the U.K. and Spain since 2019 and by the end of 2020, it was made available worldwide.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-important-conversations-into-movable-bubbles"><span>Turn important conversations into movable bubbles</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.96%;"><img id="XeijHMvx9aigL6irshLtnf" name="google-messages-bubble-notifications.jpg" alt="Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeijHMvx9aigL6irshLtnf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1228" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bubbles takes an important text conversation and turns it into a movable bubble that appears on your phoneâs home screen so you can keep up to date with it at all times, and reply on the fly. Itâs great for important conversations so you donât miss a message and donât have to click into the Google Messages app every time you need to read the next missive. Whether itâs a message string with your spouse, kids, boss, or even your besties, itâs a great way to prioritize a conversation.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Settings</strong> via your profile photo at the top right.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Bubbles</strong>.</p><p>6. Select <strong>Selected conversations can bubble</strong> (the wording is Selected only for Samsung Galaxy devices), or <strong>All conversations can bubble.</strong></p><p>7. Go back to the main page.</p><p>8. Wait for a message to arrive in the conversation you want to bubble in Google Messages. Once it does, pull down from the top of the phone to open the Notification window and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>9. Find the message and long-press it.</p><p>10. Tap the slider to the right for Bubble this conversation to turn it on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.96%;"><img id="eQX9Rskh4hc7dQYzR5eLaG" name="google messages bubbles 2.jpg" alt="google messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQX9Rskh4hc7dQYzR5eLaG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1228" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bubbles, it should be noted, are not part of RCS chat, so you donât have to enable that in order to use them. Theyâre just a standard feature that has been available with Google Messages for some time. Also, you can eliminate the last few steps when using a Samsung Galaxy phone, as these include a small square with an arrow pointing to the bottom right corner and a message notification that allows you to instantly bubble it to your home screen.Â </p><p>Itâs also worth noting that in order to un-bubble a conversation, you need to reverse these steps and go back to the Settings menu. You canât simply flick it away, so be choosy about which conversations you bubble and stick to only your most important conversation string.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-reduce-image-sizes-to-send-more-quickly"><span>Reduce image sizes to send more quickly</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.96%;"><img id="P5FNzW89JL9beErRSgkKcn" name="google messages send photos faster.jpg" alt="google messages send photos faster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P5FNzW89JL9beErRSgkKcn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1228" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other instant messaging services, you can send more than just text and emojis through Google Messages. You can also send photos and videos. A feature introduced last year allows you to send photos using RCS even faster by scaling down resolution. The trade-off is that the photo is of lower resolution. But when you have a slow Internet or cellular connection, this allows you to send vacation photos, for example, without having to wait for several minutes before they go through. With this option, if you are experiencing lower data speeds, it will ensure your photos zip over to the recipient or recipients in record time.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open<strong> Settings </strong>by tapping on your profile picture at the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Turn on <strong>Send photos faster</strong> by tapping the slider to the right.</p>
<p>You might find that the Send photos faster option is actually already on, as itâs on by default on some phones. In this case, you have already been enjoying it without knowing it! If thatâs the case, continue doing what youâre doing and rest assured your photos are being adjusted so they send as quickly as possible. Otherwise, if you want to send images in higher resolution, you should toggle it off.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-toggle-show-expressive-animations"><span>Toggle Show expressive animations</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT" name="google-messages-rcs-chatting-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS chatting on a Pixel 4a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-messages-gets-new-emoji-reaction-effects">Expressive Animations</a> are a neat option in Google Messages, animating commonly used emojis like the thumbs up and down symbols, the laughing emoji, heart, angry, birthday, and more. But many users werenât too keen on them popping up all the time, especially with these emojis that tend to be used frequently in conversation. Before you get started with Google Messages, you might want to toggle this off so it doesnât make your everyday conversations a little too expressive.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong> by tapping on your profile picture at the top right.</p><p>3. Toggle <strong>Show expressive animations</strong>, depending on whether you want them on or off.</p>
<p>Note that this feature might not yet be rolled out to your specific device, depending on when you read this. But do a quick check, and if itâs there, go ahead and turn it off and you find it to be too much. You can always go back and turn it on when you are up for it. In a perfect world, Google would allow you to choose which emoji become expressive animations, and such customization could potentially be available in the future. Note that turning this feature off wonât impact your Photomoji.</p>

<p>One Time Password (OTP) messages arrive with a special temporary code that expires within a few minutes. They can only be used once and are designed for two-factor authentication. Youâll often see these from sources like a financial institution or when logging into a secure site of some kind. Once you receive an OTP message, chances are you move on to the task at hand and forget all about it. This can add to clutter in your Google Messages. Thankfully, thereâs an easy way to set it such that they delete after 24 hours, freeing up space on your phone and reducing clutter.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Settings</strong> by tapping on your profile photo at the top right corner.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Message settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Go to <strong>Message organization</strong>.</p><p>5. Turn <strong>Auto-delete OTPS after 24 hours</strong> to the on position by tapping the slider on the right. Â </p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-customize-swipe-gestures-in-google-messages">customized swipe gestures in Google Messages</a>, you can set what the app does when you swipe left or right on a particular message. You can have it do nothing if you find you often inadvertently swipe when you donât mean to, have it archive a message, or even simply delete it. First, you need to set this feature up.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Messages</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Settings</strong> via your profile photo in the top right.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Message Settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down and select <strong>Swipe actions</strong>.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Customize for Swipe right</strong> and select what you want this action to do.</p><p>6.

<p>Thatâs it! From here, cleaning up your Google Messages inbox become easy as pie with a simple swipe to the left or right on each message.</p>

<p>You can personalize the look of text bubbles in Google Messages by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-change-text-bubble-color-google-messages">changing the color</a> thanks to this feature that was added in late 2023. It allows you to swap a dull color for something brighter and bolder if desired, or maybe a more muted hue for professional conversations. This can be done by simply changing the theme on your phone, but Google Messages lets you change bubble colors in individual chats, too.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open a conversation</strong> in Google Messages.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>three dots</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Change colors</strong>.</p><p>4. Select the color you desire.</p><p>5. Select <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p>
<p>You can choose from nine color options, and the color will change for your messages, with only slight changes for the receiving messages. Keep in mind that this feature is only for RCS chats and may still be rolling out to devices.</p>

<p>Available for use with both SMS or RCS since it was announced in late 2023 (the feature may not yet be available for all Android devices), you can take a photo from your phone, turn it into an adorable Photomoji, then send it to someone in a Google Message. Itâs easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">use Photomoji in the Google Messages app</a>. These are created right from your photo album, so thereâs no third-party app needed.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app.</p><p>2. Open a <strong>conversation window</strong>.</p><p>3. Select the <strong>emoji icon</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>Create</strong>.</p><p>5. Choose an image from your library.</p><p>6. The subject of the photo will be extracted from the image and turned into a Photomoji.</p><p>7. Select <strong>Send</strong>.</p><p>8. To use an already created Photomoji as a reaction within a message, <strong>Long-press on the message</strong>.</p><p>9. Select the <strong>emoji icon</strong>.</p><p>10. Select the<strong> Photomoji tab</strong> (you can also create a new Photomoji from here by selecting <strong>Create</strong> instead.)</p><p>11. Pick the Photomoji from your library and <strong>Send</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="K5fU6jZu2vV8SRWJVDxnEX" name="How to use Photomoji as a reaction Google Messages.jpg" alt="Using Photomoji as a rection in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K5fU6jZu2vV8SRWJVDxnEX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1805" height="1808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing to note is that you canât crop the image, rotate it, or add filters, so you may wish to crop and/or rotate it in Photos first to the exact look you want and save that version of the photo as a copy to use for the purposes of Photomoji. Once you create and send a Photomoji, it will be saved as a sticker that you can use any time you want, expressing yourself more creatively than with just plain text or even basic emojis.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve tested a few smartwatches with LTE over the years: the Garmin Forerunner 945 LTE, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Pixel Watch 2 LTE. The <em>concept</em> of leaving my phone behind and running free with an on-wrist backup used to tempt me. But my cellular watch experiment made me realize it&apos;s not for me.Â </p><p>You&apos;ll find dozens of forums and Reddit threads for Apple, Samsung, Google, and Garmin users that are all variations on the same question: Should I buy (or do I need) an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">LTE smartwatch</a>? Invariably, you&apos;ll get passionate and logical answers for both "yes" and "no."</p><p>Some people describe the joy they feel of shedding the weight of their massive Ultra or Pro Max phones during runs without losing access to emergency calls and text notifications. They say the call quality isn&apos;t too much different from that of their phones and mention how they love to stream playlists or check directions without anything in their pockets.</p><p>You get just as many people saying they never go anywhere without their phone â making an LTE watch superfluousâand that a watch display is too small to replace a phone&apos;s comfortably when they&apos;d rather use the real thing.Â </p><p>Others explain that they bought an LTE watch but ended up canceling the extra lineâeither because their carrier charged way too much in hidden fees or because they realized how rarely they used it.Â And I&apos;ve heard horror stories from AC writers about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-watch-4-letdown">LTE smartwatches overheating</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZgzPgvbFan2xA8RwGbPhA" name="garmin-forerunner-945-lte-3.jpg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner LTE, showing an option for Live Event Sharing via satellite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZgzPgvbFan2xA8RwGbPhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first LTE watch was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, part of a care package of Android watches and phones from my EIC in my early days at Android Central. I liked its running metrics, but I never tested the cellular tech. Its safety features, like LiveTrack, felt superfluous when I rarely strayed far from home on runs, and it didn&apos;t have the mic, speaker, or texting features to make it feel worthwhile.Â </p><p>Since then, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> for kids, Garmin hasn&apos;t released another LTE watch, despite users clamoring for a cellular version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or Fenix 7. Perhaps the 945 LTE didn&apos;t sell well enough for Garmin to be confident in the tech, or else the company knows the Garmin Messenger app isn&apos;t popular enough for its iPhone-owning fans to pay for LTE.Â </p><p>More likely, Garmin wants to double down on satellite tech like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/is-garmin-inreach-messenger-worth-buying">InReach Messenger</a> since Garmin has responded to over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-2023-sos-report-shows-how-satellite-saves-lives">10,000 SOSs</a> across 100+ countries. Satellite fits more with its brand than cellular, which can&apos;t be counted on in areas where serious athletes or adventurers might train.Â </p>

<p>Back to LTE watches: During my months-long <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> review, I did my due diligence, setting up an expensive cellular line. If ever there was a "standalone" smartwatch that would let me leave my phone behind, I thought that would be it.Â </p><p>I wasn&apos;t wrong! It works perfectly well <em>sans</em> my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-review">iPhone 14 Pro</a>. I answered calls and streamed music over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">AirPods Pros</a>, tapped out texts, glanced at notifications, and enjoyed the lack of weight in my pocket. I could certainly see the appeal of cellular.</p><p>The next time I went running, I kept my phone with me because my combination of dual-band GPS, Apple Music, and cellular use had burned through my watch&apos;s battery life like nobody&apos;s business.Â </p><p>I prioritize long battery life when picking my favorite watches; daily-charge watches like an Apple or Pixel Watch already feel like a compromise, and LTE usage only makes that worse. You can put LTE on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> with better battery life, but you&apos;ll lose the apps and messaging that make cellular worth paying for.Â </p><p>Add in the fact that my carrier (AT&T) would charge me about $180 a year for my Ultra 2 line when you add in fees and taxes, and you shouldn&apos;t be surprised that my LTE experiment ended prematurely.Â </p>

<p>I recently got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> LTE, and I&apos;m excited to put it through its paces, but I&apos;m not going to turn on the cellular function this time.Â </p><p>LTE has its uses, especially on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids&apos; smartwatches</a>. Some brands have built-in cellular so you can avoid giving your child a phone too young; others have geo-locked alerts that notify you if your kid leaves a safe zone like home or school. Either way, LTE is essential in this specific use case.</p><p>However, for adult use, an LTE smartwatch is nothing but a diet smartphone. I like the idea of having an on-demand backup for emergencies, but it&apos;s hard to convince myself to fit cellular into my budget when I can just be careful and keep my smartphone on hand and fully charged.Â </p>

<p>As an athlete, satellite would be more useful to me in a remote emergency. And even that feels like something that sounds great on paper, but very few people will buy into itâjust like LTE.</p><p>Apple made a splash with satellite emergency features on iPhones, prompting Qualcomm to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-android-partners">sell Iridium satellite tech to eager Android brands</a>. But this push died quickly once Qualcomm and friends realized that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-satellite-dies-before-it-could-live">most people don&apos;t want to pay for satellite</a>.Â </p><p>Satellite on iPhonesâjust like LTE on watchesâburns through battery life quickly and will cost about $180/year once Apple&apos;s free trial ends. People like having that emergency SOS option, but once they have to pay for it preemptively? Usage will drop off to the ultra-prepared and those who live in remote areas.Â </p><p>I&apos;d want satellite more than cellular in a crisis, but having tested niche satellite-enabled products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">Garmin GPSMAP 67i</a>âwhich makes you pay anywhere from $15â65/month for InReachâI know that I&apos;d rather try to avoid emergency situations than pay so much in the off-chance I&apos;ll run into one.Â </p><p>Maybe this all makes me irresponsible or short-sighted, and I&apos;d never begrudge anyone who pays for an LTE smartwatch or satellite SOS backups. But I&apos;m guessing I&apos;m in the majority of those that just don&apos;t find it worth the cost.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sonos-launch-ace-headphones"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Sonos launched its first-ever headphones, "Ace," which look a bit like Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods-max-review">AirPods Max</a>. However, as a unique feature, an in-house engineered design allows the ear cups to be removed, making them easier to clean or swap out for new colors. These Bluetooth wireless headphones offer wired playback through the lone USB-C port. Out of the box, users will get one USB-C-to-USB-C and a USB-C-to-3.5mm to accommodate accessories that can be connected to the headphones.</p><p>Each cup has 40mm drivers and four microphones, which deliver active noise cancellation (ANC) in the &apos;Aware mode.&apos; The headphones come with Dolby Atmos support and can stream spatial audio content from supported services, including head tracking, wherever available. Later this year, Sonos says it will add "TrueCinema," a new tech that will map the space around you and create a virtual surround sound system to match your room.</p><p>The Sonos Ace comes in two colorways black or soft white, mirroring Sonos&apos; moreÂ color with its Era speakers. The company claims that the battery lasts up to 30 hours and will be available for pre-order for $449 starting May 21, with general availability on June 5.</p>

<ul><li>Google created a new version of the Google Weather app in 2023 and started rolling it out on select Pixel devices.Â </li><li>Though the overhauled Google Weather app appeared on more Pixel phones and tablets running Android 14 later, it was still exclusive to Pixel.

<hr>
<p>Google is slowly but steadily updating all of its core apps to match the Material You design language, and Google Weather received that treatment last year. Initially, the redesigned Google Weather app was exclusive to Pixel phones and tablets, although it eventually reached a select few non-Pixel devices. Now, it looks like the refreshed Google Weather app is finally rolling out widely on more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/23/new-google-weather-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> was the first to notice the Google Weather app on more devices, after some users started seeing the overhauled app on their devices and posted to social media. These included phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and Honor. However, it was one user on X (formerly Twitter) that provided the most concrete evidence that the Google Weather app should be available on most Android devices.Â </p><p>Thatâs because the user claimed to have the new Google Weather âappâ on a Nokia 4.2, which was running Android 11. Through an update to the Google app, this user now sees the same Google Weather design as seen on Pixels devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting, my old Nokia 4.2 got the new Google Weather "app" after an update to the Google app, today. This phone is on Android 11. I have never seen the new Google Weather on anything but a Pixel on Android 14, so it must be more widely rolling out. https://t.co/IXeyQvBCTA<a href="https://twitter.com/LBPHeretic/status/1793449748562645263">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Aside from the Material You design refresh, users will gain other benefits by getting the new Google Weather app. Of course, the approachable and colorful design is an advantage in itself for some, but there are practical advantages that came with the newly redesigned app, too. These include providing more data and using machine learning to make predictions for rain and precipitation.Â </p><p>Google sees an opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">improve weather forecasting using AI</a> and machine learning and has a research project concerning that very idea. For now, there are consumer-grade features that aim to provide more accurate predictions for precipitations using ML in the updated Google Weather app.</p><p>Since people are starting to see the redesigned Google Weather app on a slew of devices from various brands, it feels safe to say the redesign is rolling out in full force.</p>
