Many of them are just out to Nickle-and-Dime you to death with microtransactions, and the worst types of free-to-play games can have toxic communities that are filled with rude players that make for a bad experience.</p><p>But the best free Meta Quest games for headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> are all made to help players find the right types of players and have a great time. Plus, these games are <strong>full-fledged</strong> games, not some watered-down versions of popular titles that you&apos;ll quickly get sick of. In fact, all of these games are regularly updated with fresh content and ways to have fun with friends each and every week.</p><p>Ready to get started? These are the best free Meta Quest 2 and 3 games.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gorilla-tag"><span>Gorilla Tag</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3Lsxq7dAO8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Undoubtedly, the premiere free Meta Quest game is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-quest-game-of-the-week">Gorilla Tag</a>, the viral sensation that launched a few years back and has exploded since then. Thousands of gamers hop on Gorilla Tag daily, and for good reason. As you might expect from a game featuring "Monke&apos;s," Gorilla Tag is a highly social experience.</p><p>At its core, Gorilla Tag is a simple game of virtual tag where you&apos;ll fling your gorilla character around a wide variety of levels in an attempt to catch other players. Three additional game modes will spice things up a bit, but don&apos;t be surprised if you just find yourself hanging out with new friends and making up your own games in a world that uses a unique PlayStation 1-style visual aesthetic.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-population-one"><span>Population: One</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7INK9V1zjQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You can think of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/population-one-channels-fortnite-with-free-to-play-switch-graphical-upgrades">Population: One</a> as the "Fortnite of VR." The battle royale went free-to-play in Spring 2023 and has seen a significant uptick in player population since. Just like Fortnite, the only thing you&apos;ll be paying for are the character and weapon skins, and the team at BigBox VR is constantly cranking out new and interesting choices to peruse.</p><p>Battle Royale fans can play the original map or the "evolving map" in squads of three players with rulesets that change regularly. The team has been putting together seasonal content to keep things fresh, and the built-in map editor means deathmatch rounds might take place on a Mario Kart track, a classic Unreal map, or even the N64-styled halls of Goldeneye 007.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t just any old battle royale. Population: One was designed bespoke for VR, so the controls and movement are totally unque to the medium. You can climb anything and soar anywhere by holding out your arms like a pair of wings. It&apos;s a surreal experience that just gets better with time!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gods-of-gravity"><span>Gods of Gravity</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TmbDI9209A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-best-new-quest-2-game-of-2023-wont-even-cost-you-a-dime">Gods of Gravity</a> takes the god game genre into an entirely new dimension, giving players full control over fleets of interstellar ships. Massive space battles await players who can strategically plan their galactic takeover, building ships and claiming worlds to gain more resources. There&apos;s nothing quite like grabbing your ships and flinging them into the next solar system to understand the power of immersive VR!</p><p>Each of the game&apos;s playable god classes has its own set of positives and negatives, as well as a special power that can be activated. The game&apos;s easy social atmosphere makes it effortless to play with friends, and regular tournaments reward serious players who enjoy diving deep into the strategy required to win big. But don&apos;t worry, even casual players can have a great time with co-op modes or single-player training sessions.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-zenith-nexus"><span>Zenith Nexus</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9_hU8iAp64" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/zenith-the-last-city-vr-mmo">Zenith: Nexus</a> is the free-to-play relaunch of the original VR MMO. Nexus splits the game into two, leaving the MMO Zenith: The Last City as a "paid DLC" and opening up a completely free-to-play pseudo-sequel in the form of Infinite Realms.</p><p>Infinite Realms is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG that makes it easy to play alongside friends or other players to battle mobs, race in parkour challenges, and complete what the developer describes as "quick session-based runs." There&apos;s even a social lobby where players can shoot hoops, cook recipes, or just hangout and chat.</p><p>Plus, once you&apos;re ready to head out into the full MMO experience, you can just download The Last City DLC and jump in that with any friend who owns it.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-rec-room"><span>Rec Room</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcX-SQ2IS7M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Rec Room is the family-friendly social experience where anyone can play together without fear of harassment or foul language. Rec Room&apos;s main games include basketball, laser tag, a host of adventures with themes like pirates, space aliens, and more. Plus, player-created rooms are a blast for everyone to play and significantly change up the gameplay in important ways, similar to how Roblox and other social player-created games work.</p><p>Better yet, players don&apos;t have to have experience with programming or PC-based tools to make their own worlds, unlike a lot of other large social games. The in-game tools are powerful, yet easy to use, and you can invite your friends to play in your creations when you&apos;re finished.</p><p>Rec Room also has excellent parental controls that make you feel good about letting your kids play in VR. Given the large number of kids playing VR games, it&apos;s important that parents are able to provide their kids with safe environments.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-horizon-worlds"><span>Horizon Worlds</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sd7du11ZPZo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Horizon Worlds is the social experience built-in to Meta Quest headsets. It&apos;s super easy to find worlds to play in, and the game uses the Quest&apos;s built-in friends list, making it easy to connect with friends and hang out. Horizon Worlds started off pretty roughly but recent updates have significantly upgraded the experience, adding great free-to-play experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/super-rumble-horizon-worlds-titanborne/">Super Rumble</a>, the hit FPS experience.</p><p>Plus, Meta partners with big names like NBA to bring live sports viewing, concerts, and other live events in Horizon Worlds for players to experience together. There&apos;s even an entire TV series called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/event/610069461312317/">The Faceless Lady</a> presented by Eli Roth and Crypt TV to change up the atmosphere from bright and friendly to dark and spooky.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vrchat"><span>VRChat</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWLPw4RE9Ig" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>You&apos;d have to be living under a rock to never have heard of VRChat. At the least, you&apos;ve probably seen a video recorded in VRChat, a purely social game where people can use any avatar they want. Whether that&apos;s your favorite (definitely not copyright) character model, an anime catgirl, a cute animal, or anything in-between, you can fully express yourself in the world of VRChat.</p><p>Of course, full expression comes with players who regularly harass others, but finding the right groups or VR worlds will keep those bad experiences at bay. Worlds can be anything from a social hangout space, a night rave club, or even full-fledged games like a recreation of Among Us.</p><p>The Meta Quest version of the game is more limited than the PC version, though, so you won&apos;t be able to experience every world on the standalone system. That&apos;s the main reason this isn&apos;t ranked higher on our list.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-gun-raiders"><span>Gun Raiders</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwnZu2ppiiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>If you&apos;re old enough to remember the Tribes series of multiplayer shooters from the late 90s and early 2000s, you&apos;ll feel right at home in this free-to-play multiplayer shooter. Gun Raiders outfits each player with a jetpack and lets you do impressive aerial moves around sizable levels. Game modes range from simple deathmatch rounds to full-scale battle royale, assault, control, donut, and plenty of others.</p><p>As is the case with many free-to-play games, Gun Raiders updates regularly and players can choose to purchase skins separately or subscribe to the battle pass that runs the length of each season. With the battle pass, the more often you play, the more you&apos;ll unlock. It&apos;s a total blast and it&apos;s hard to believe this one is completely free!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-big-ballers-vr"><span>Big Ballers VR</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq89_E6hVmQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Big Ballers is regularly heralded as "the best VR sports game" by players across social media and in the thousands of reviews the game has garnered on the Meta Horizon Store. Whether you&apos;re playing 12-player basketball, baseball, American football, or just working out in the mixed reality mode, there&apos;s something for everyone here.</p><p>The developers have been keeping the game up-to-date with new content monthly, and players swear by its physics system and easy-to-learn mechanics. Big Ballers is a social game first, and the game&apos;s reputation system means you can be sure you&apos;re playing with respectful players who won&apos;t badmouth you or make you feel bad. It&apos;s a great time for everyone!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-wooorld"><span>Wooorld</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCTkp1synho" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>At first Woorld looks like it&apos;s just "Google Maps in VR." Thankfully, the game is a lot deeper than that, and it can be pure joy to explore the world with friends thanks to the game&apos;s clever use of 3D maps and Street View technology. Plan your next vacation with friends and family or jump into "Where in the Wooorld" to test your geography skills.</p><p>Where in the Wooorld is a lot like a VR scavenger hunt where players will be dropped into a Street View location in a random location and will have to use the visual clues around them to guess where in the world they are. Think of it a bit like the classic Carmen Sandiego games, except you&apos;re the detective this time.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bait"><span>Bait!</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uuM_LL2DEzc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Fishing can be fun, but getting up at the crack of dawn and getting sunburned in a boat sure isn&apos;t. That&apos;s where Bait! comes in. Jump in eight different environments alongside friends and fish the day (or night) away. Compete in tournaments and catch more than 60 types of fish.</p><p>Up to four friends can fish together in the game&apos;s multiplayer sessions, and the game&apos;s social lobbies support up to 12 players at a time, making this a great chill social experience to dive into.</p>

<h2 id="free-doesn-apos-t-mean-cheap-2">Free doesn&apos;t mean cheap</h2>
<p>Some free experiences can leave a bad taste in your mouth, but these free Meta Quest games are anything but cheap or lame experiences. These are full-fledged games that give players the ability to enjoy time with others without spending an arm and a leg to get it.</p><p>Plus, it&apos;s just plain easier to get your friends to try something new when they don&apos;t have to spend a dime, right? Many of the games on this list are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, further proving that free-to-play doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to be bad.</p><p>Since all of these games are social experiences, it&apos;s important to ensure that your account is set up correctly, especially if it&apos;s a kids account.

<p>The Google Pixel 7a boasts a vibrant and fluid 90Hz display with the efficiency of the Tensor G2 chipset (the same processor that powers the Pixel 7 Pro). You also get all of the exclusive software features that Pixel fans love, plus OS upgrades and security updates for years to come. Battery life isn&apos;t anything special, but we can still confidently say that the Pixel 7a is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> on the market today, even as the Pixel 8a approaches.</p><p>Speaking of which, how will the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> compare to its predecessor? Rumor has it that the phone will launch with an upgraded battery and the same Tensor G3 chipset that powers its more-expensive flagship counterparts. It also seems likely that the Pixel 8a will hit the streets with a $499 price tag come release day. </p><p>I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll see some Pixel 8a preorder deals that lower that price, but if you want a cheap Pixel today and you don&apos;t care about all of the latest bells and whistles, this Google Pixel 7a deal from Best Buy is a wise choice. </p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp brings two new handy features to Communities.</li><li>While one can create events like Calendar apps, the other allows group admins to catch up quickly with organized replies. </li><li>The features will be rolled out Communities’ groups, and other groups are likely to follow soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced some new features for its Communities that allow users to stay more organized on the messaging platform.<strong> <br>
<br>
</strong>First off, the messaging platform allows users to create calendar events. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-to-communities-events-and-replies-in-announcement-groups">accompanying blog post</a>, WhatsApp indicates that the second functionality has been launched specifically for Communities groups where users can respond to important updates posted by admins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uotRTWAZopvBzWNnVGs6ZD" name="whatsapp-communities-event.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Calendar events" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uotRTWAZopvBzWNnVGs6ZD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Events such as virtual meetings or birthdays can now be planned in groups within Communities. Any user in the group can create such events, and other participants can respond to them. The messaging platform also provides automatic notifications for those attending the event when the date approaches. </p><p>The ability to create events is currently available to groups in WhatsApp Communities, but the messaging app says this feature will be extended to other groups going forward. </p>
<p>In Announcement Groups from Communities, admins can now easily comprehend what the group members want through their organized replies and likewise catch up to what’s happening in the community. These replies “are grouped together and minimized” so that users can clearly see in what context they were posted in the group. Also, users aren’t annoyed with notifications of those replies as they are likely muted for everyone.</p><p>WhatsApp further announced that new features will be rolled out to Communities and groups in the coming months,<strong> </strong>which include more tools to help users stay organized on the messaging platform.<br>
<br></p>
<p>On the other hand, the app also recently tested a new setting in Communities that allows users to join groups only on an invite basis. </p><p>The Meta-owned messaging platform has constantly been testing such features to catch up with or stay ahead of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging platforms</a>. More recently, the app was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-working-on-in-app-dialer">found testing</a> an in-app dialer that would allow users to place calls directly from the app for unknown numbers or businesses. It is a handy feature for users who don’t want to store those numbers in their address book because the interactions with them are likely once or twice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Messages is getting rid of the "Nudge" reply reminder and birthday reminder features that many users found useful.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/01/google-messages-nudges/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> noticed that the latest beta of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> has removed the feature. We can confirm that it is no longer visible in beta version 20240430 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>.</p><p>If you go to Settings > Suggestions, you won&apos;t see Nudges listed. But you&apos;ll still find Smart Reply, Suggested Actions, Magic Compose, and Suggested Stickers there.</p>

<p>In late 2021, Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-messages-could-soon-gain-gmail-nudges-feature">quietly introduced the "Nudges" feature</a>, and it was actually quite handy. It would, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-message-reminders-in-google-messages">nudge you to respond to messages you might have overlooked</a> or to follow up on ongoing conversations. Plus, for those of you who aren&apos;t the best at remembering dates, it also offered helpful reminders for things like birthdays.</p><p>While you could add birthday reminders to your calendar, getting them right from an app you frequently use is a bit more handy. Also, constantly moving features around between apps can be off-putting.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t clearly explained why they removed the feature, and it&apos;s still mentioned on Google Messages&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/11555591?hl=en" target="_blank">support page</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/google-messages/#:~:text=helpful%20reminders%20and%20nudges" target="_blank">Android landing page</a>. Google may have something better planned, but for now, its sudden removal is pretty puzzling.</p><p>The search giant will presumably address this at Google I/O later this month, where we might hear new features from Google, including something to replace "Nudges." With AI increasingly handling these kinds of tasks, there&apos;s a good chance we could see an AI-powered feature unveiled as a replacement.</p><p>It looks like this is happening with Gmail and other Google Workspace apps, where AI features are stepping in to boost productivity.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced last year that it would start adding badges to official government apps, and this change is rolling out now.</li><li>Over 3,000 state and federal apps from 12 countries now show a visual badge displaying that they are official government apps. </li><li>Since government apps often require users to provide identifying or banking information, this is a way for users to make sure they're sharing private data with the right app. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has tried to clean up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Play Store</a> of late, and part of that initiative now includes marking government apps with a visual badge to show that they are official. The move was quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/ensuring-high-quality-apps-on-google-play.html" target="_blank">announced</a> in November 2023, but it is just now rolling out to app listings on the Google Play Store. Thousands of official state and federal apps feature a government badge — which looks like a building — directly above the <strong>Install</strong> button. </p><p>Like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">other badges on app listings</a>, you can tap the government badge to learn more about what it means. After doing so, the Play Store will bring up the following message: "Official government, Play verified this app is affiliated with a government entity." This new badge is placed between the app reviews average and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) score.</p><p>Google says that it started testing the new program with "a small percentage of users" over the past few months. It&apos;s now widely rolling out with support for over 3,000 official state and federal apps in 12 countries. For now, only certain apps in Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India, and Mexico can feature a government badge.</p><p>For example, official United States government apps like FEMA and IRS2Go have the official badge. Additionally, the official MyGovIndia app sports a badge. Some state apps like MyTN also feature a badge, just to name a few. </p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, the Google Play Store&apos;s developer policies already prevent apps from falsely presenting themselves as an official government app in a misleading way. When apps claim that they are affiliated with a government or agency, Google works with those agencies to confirm these changes are legitimate. </p><p>Still, these new badges help make it more clear that the app you are downloading and interacting with is actually the official one from a state or federal government. Considering that many of these apps ask for identifying information and more, it&apos;s easy to see why you wouldn&apos;t want to share that data with a nonofficial app. Google says it partnered with dozens of governments and developer partners to facilitate these app badges, and this Play Store program may expand in the future. </p>

<hr>
<p>Instagram unveiled a bunch of new stickers on Friday (May 3), including an "Add Your Music" (AYM) sticker, that allows you to start public threads of your favorite songs in Stories.</p><p>The AYM sticker turns your story into a music template, making it super easy to share your favorite songs with friends, as per Instagram&apos;s announcement. Plus, it lets others reply to your Stories with their own tunes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram">Instagram</a> is teaming up with Dua Lipa to promote her new album, "Radical Optimism," and to showcase the new music sticker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ARQGaqMgbC4aWJDjGV9YLa" name="Instagram-add-yours-music-sticker.png" alt="New Instagram stickers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ARQGaqMgbC4aWJDjGV9YLa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides the AYM sticker, the photo and video-sharing platform is also rolling out other fun stickers, such as Frames, Reveal, and Cutouts.</p><p>The Frames sticker transforms your photo into a Polaroid once you shake your phone. Doing this will reveal what&apos;s inside the sticker. The Reveal sticker lets you post a hidden story that followers can only see by sending you a DM.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cutouts lets you turn any photo or video from your camera roll into a custom sticker, adding flair to your stories and reels.</p>

<p>Like the "Add Yours" sticker introduced in 2021, this new interactive sticker allows users to create a content chain where each person adds their own Story.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-takes-aim-at-tiktok-with-these-new-reels-features">new sticker bears a resemblance to TikTok&apos;s "Duet" feature</a>, where users can create content alongside an original video. However, Instagram&apos;s version has a slight twist: it gathers everyone&apos;s additional posts in the content chain in one place, unlike TikTok, which doesn&apos;t currently display all the duetted videos from an original TikTok in a single location.</p><p>To try out the new feature, just tap on the sticker tool in the top navigation bar when you&apos;re creating or uploading content for your Story. Then, pick the AYM sticker to kick off a public thread. Or, if you want to join a chain, simply tap on an AYM sticker and add your own Story to participate.</p><p>The feature encourages collaboration and helps you discover new people to follow. Tap the sticker in someone&apos;s Story to see everyone who&apos;s joined the thread and check out their Stories.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has long reigned in the foldable space, particularly due to its cheaper Z Flip series. However, Motorola has given the company some welcome competition in North America with the launch of the Razr Plus and the much cheaper Razr 2023, the latter of which continues to have shockingly low prices. Now, Nubia has seemingly come out of nowhere with a mid-range flip phone that aims to threaten Motorola&apos;s hold on the affordable foldable phone segment.</p><p>You may not have heard of Nubia, but the company makes some rather impressive flagship smartphones and gaming phones. The Flip 5G is the company&apos;s first foray into foldables, which is interesting since companies normally tend to launch larger foldables first before downsizing with flip phones. But just like Motorola, Nubia wants to target a lower price point to undercut its biggest competitor, Samsung.</p><p>I&apos;ve hoped for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-make-galaxy-z-flip-fe">more affordable Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>, something that could launch alongside the company&apos;s flagship flip phone as a more up-to-date alternative to those not willing to fork out $999. Of course, Samsung would have to make significant changes to bring the price down, but Nubia and Motorola show that this is very doable.</p><p>At this price point, there are bound to be some compromises, especially for a flip phone. In my time with the Flip 5G, I&apos;ve tried to determine whether or not said compromises ruin the overall experience of owning a modern flip phone, which is currently my favorite phone form factor. To put it plainly, I&apos;m mixed.</p>

<p>The Nubia Flip 5G was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-unveiled-at-mwc-2024">announced</a> in February 2024 during MWC and went on sale in April. The phone is available in two configurations and starts at $499 for the 8+256GB model, while the 12+512GB model is available for $699.</p><p>There are three colors to choose from: Cosmic Black, Sunshine Gold, and Flowing Lilac.</p><p>The phone doesn&apos;t appear to be available through retailers like Amazon, but you can purchase the device unlocked directly from Nubia.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">Flip phones</a> are known for being more compact, but there also seems to be more of a focus on design, at least compared to their larger-screened counterparts. That&apos;s clear when I look at the Nubia Flip 5G; it&apos;s probably one of the best-looking flip phones I&apos;ve had the pleasure of reviewing. The flat aluminum alloy frame and angular chassis remind me a lot of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 but with a softer look and touch. However, where the phone really stands out is the circular housing where the cover screen and cameras are.</p><p>The housing is mostly black with a golden ring around it, which adds a premium touch to the design. If you have a lighter color option, such as Flowing Lilac or Sunshine Gold, the camera/cover display housing really contrasts against the rest of the device. In fact, the phone looks more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">TECNO Phantom V Flip</a> had a baby.</p>

<p>At just 7mm thick when open and 15mm when closed, the Nubia Flip 5G is fairly thin for a flip phone, roughly matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>. Although, at 209g, it&apos;s a bit heavier than either of the 2023 Razr models and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>. Even so, it doesn&apos;t feel particularly heavy, especially with the unique glass covering the back panels (which I&apos;ll get to later).</p><p>Opening and closing the phone feels very satisfying and Nubia&apos;s hinge is quite sturdy, keeping the phone open at various angles. When open, the 6.9-inch FHD+ display is pretty nice when viewed indoors, and the 120Hz refresh rate keeps things smooth, although you&apos;ll have to go into the settings to enable this since the phone is set to 60Hz at default. But even when set to the standard color mode, the display is pretty vibrant, and the crease, while not as smooth as some other foldables, is fortunately not as deep as on the Z Flip 5 display.</p>

<p>The phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a>, a two-year-old midrange chipset that still provides good performance at this price point. The phone doesn&apos;t falter when opening and juggling multiple apps, thanks to the 8GB of RAM (there&apos;s also a 12GB model). Even when gaming, the chipset seems to handle itself quite well. Playing Honkai: Star Rail, the Nubia Flip 5G defaults to medium settings, but the phone is able to handle the game even at high settings at 60fps, which is pretty impressive.</p><p>That said, the top half of the phone, particularly the frame, gets quite warm when you push it, so you&apos;ll want to be careful.</p>

<p>The primary camera is a 50MP sensor with autofocus. I admittedly didn&apos;t expect much out of the camera, given the price point, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it takes pretty decent images in good lighting conditions. Images are crisp and plenty vibrant during the day, and the output is better than what I would get from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a> (and even the Razr Plus, to an extent). That said, it can sometimes go a little overboard with saturation, and details degrade quickly when you start zooming in.</p>

<p>Low-light photos aren&apos;t particularly strong, but video capture is good, even if the phone tops out at 4K30. Nubia also has some fun filters that you can view and edit in real time while you prepare to take a photo, which can help make images a little more artsy.</p>

<p>The cover screen is one of the main reasons to consider buying a flip phone, thanks to the added utility of being able to check notifications and other functions without needing to open the phone. Unfortunately, the Nubia Flip 5G is pretty limited in this regard.</p><p>The cover screen is a circular OLED panel measuring 1.43, so roughly the size of a large smartwatch display. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not nearly as useful. The cover screen lets you cycle through eight different panels with different functions, such as a calendar, voice recorder, camera, and music player. You can also view notifications, but you can&apos;t do anything with them on the cover screen itself, as it will just prompt you to open your phone to check it. Additionally, while I can expand multiple notifications from the same app, the phone doesn&apos;t let me swipe away individual notifications, leaving "Clear all" as the only viable option, and even that doesn&apos;t seem to fully work.</p><p>This isn&apos;t my only issue with notifications, but I&apos;ll get to that in the next section.</p><p>Fortunately, the cover screen still acts as a viewfinder for the camera, allowing you to take selfies with the primary 50MP sensor. You can tap to start a 2-second photo timer or swipe up and down to switch between photo, video, and portrait modes.</p>

<p>AOD functionality is a plus on the cover screen, but it seems as though the brightness is connected to the main display&apos;s brightness, which seems like a weird oversight, especially since there&apos;s no way to adjust it from the external screen.</p><p>Overall, the limitations of the screen are a little disappointing, if understandable. Again, I can&apos;t help but compare it to a smartwatch screen, which lets me type, open apps, and more, but I clearly can&apos;t expect the same from a small cover screen, especially on the app front. Even the Razr 2023 has similar limitations, and it&apos;s slightly larger at 1.5-inches.</p>

<p>The Nubia Flip 5G has a lot going for it for a $500 foldable phone, but the phone makes quite a few compromises to get down to that price. Aside from the fairly small and barely functional cover screen, the phone is limited to just one usable camera. The second 2MP depth sensor seems just like a reason to pad the spec sheet, as it&apos;s largely useless.</p><p>Taking Portrait photos requires quite a bit of tinkering before the phone is able to get even a decent image, and even then, the Nubia Flip 5G doesn&apos;t do a great job separating the background form the main subject.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2592px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ygrivZHhDm7gfzDPGcvjgJ" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-camera-sample-11.jpg" alt="A pillar outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygrivZHhDm7gfzDPGcvjgJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2592" height="1944" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the software side, the Flip 5G curiously still runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> despite launching well into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> cycle. The software itself is mostly inoffensive, and Nubia adds some software flourishes to take advantage of the foldable form factor, which you&apos;ll notice with the camera app or YouTube when the phone is at an angle. Sadly, you&apos;ll be met with quite a bit of bloatware when you first get set up, which is never fun. On the plus side, you can delete or disable any extra apps and features you don&apos;t need. I do like the daily wallpaper function, which keeps things fresh even if some of the images are quite random (why does it show me images of Celine Dion and Taylor Swift?).</p><p>What I&apos;m not a fan of is the "Z-Board," which is Nubia&apos;s bootleg Google Discover, which sits to the left of the home screen. Like Google&apos;s feed, Z-Board attempts to give you relevant news and other recommended information, but none of it seems particularly useful, and it just seems to be filled with ads as opposed to actual news. Fortunately, you can disable this, but you can&apos;t enable Google Discover in its place.</p><p>I&apos;ve also had issues with notifications. For some reason, notifications come in extremely late, or they don&apos;t come in at all. After some time, I&apos;ll open an app like Instagram, only to then be bombarded by notifications from the app that were never delivered. My smartwatch is seemingly the only way I can get notifications on time. On the one hand, it&apos;s a nice way to stay focused when I&apos;m trying to work, but on the other hand, it&apos;ll cause me to miss out on conversations or respond late.</p>

<p>Nubia wasn&apos;t exactly upfront about the update promise or even when the phone would receive Android 14, but the fact that we&apos;re already beta testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before it launches later this year is a bad sign for the Flip 5G.</p>
<p>My other problems are mostly hardware-related, such as the overaggressive auto brightness that constantly keeps the display too low for my liking or the fact that the gesture to turn on the flashlight only works when the lock screen is active. And while I really like the design of the Nubia Flip 5G, the AG etched glass feels extremely cheap, almost like plastic, although the plus side of the matte finish is that you can avoid fingerprints and smudges.</p><p>Lastly, battery life isn&apos;t terrible, but I expected more out of the 4,310mAh battery, as it can barely get me through an entire day of mixed-use (social media, games, photos). The Galaxy Z Flip 5 has a much smaller battery and still seems to last longer between charges. Fortunately, the 33W charging tops up the phone relatively quickly, but the Nubia Flip 5G misses out on wireless charging, unlike some of its closest competitors.</p>

<p>Speaking of competition, if you&apos;re looking for a cheap flip phone, you may want to consider the Motorola Razr 2023. The phone has a large battery and is powered by the same Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset with 8GB of RAM. You also get a relatively stock Android experience, a vegan leather finish, and wireless charging to boot. The downside is that it, too, also runs Android 13, and Motorola&apos;s track record for major software updates isn&apos;t great.</p><p>Elsewhere, you can also look at the TECNO Phantom V Flip. It has a similar design to the Nubia, is powered by a MediaTek chipset, and features a dual-camera system that includes an ultrawide sensor. Unfortunately, it suffers from many of the same disadvantages as the Nubia, and you likely won&apos;t be able to get your hands on it if you live in the United States.</p><p>If you&apos;re willing to spend a few more dollars, Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 5 is one of the better options, even if it does cost more. It has better cameras than what you&apos;ll find on most flip phones, the cover screen is nice and large, and Samsung&apos;s software is quite polished. You may spend more to buy it, but with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">new model</a> likely to launch in July, you may be able to snag some deals to get the price down.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a an modern flip phone.</li><li>You want a phone with a decent camera.</li><li>You don't want to spend too much on your next phone.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want polished, reliable software.</li><li>You want a versatile camera experience.</li><li>You want an all-day battery.</li><li>You need wireless charging.</li></ul>
<p>The benefit of flip phones is that they are much more flexible when it comes to price. Where the larger, tablet-like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> can easily cost as much as $1700, flagship flip phones are often priced around $999 but can go even lower. The Nubia Flip 5G is a good example of a mid-range foldable phone, hitting the same price point that you would see from other non-folding and similarly specced devices.</p><p>At a starting price of $499, it&apos;s cheaper than the Motorola Razr 2023 was at launch, although that phone is positioned a bit higher with some flagship specs thrown in. The Nubia, on the other hand, is content to offer several compromises to get down to a price that many people might be willing to shell out for a foldable phone, even as a first foray into the form factor.</p><p>Battery life may not be the best, and the cover screen is unfortunately limited in its usability, but the phone makes up for it with its one usable camera, pretty good performance, and a standout design.</p><p>As much as I&apos;d love to see Samsung launch a cheaper (but better) foldable phone, the company&apos;s sticking to the higher end allows others to tackle the lower end, a strategy that has worked for Motorola. At this price, the Nubia Flip 5G would make a good first flip phone—that is, if you can get past the bloat.</p>

<p>The new Nubia Flip 5G may be the cheapest flip phone you can buy in the U.S. right now, but that doesn't mean it is a cheap phone. The Snapdragon chip offers plenty of power, the 50MP camera is more than capable, and the cover screen makes it fairly easy to view notifications and other information at a glance.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Good Lock is now available on the Google Play Store, starting with places like Southeast Asia and potentially more regions.</li><li>The app is currently in Early Access on the Play Store, meaning Samsung is still fine-tuning things before a wider release.</li><li>It's not sure yet if the Play Store version will pack all the same modules as the Galaxy Store’s, though some parts like the One Hand Operation Plus are already there.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you love tweaking your phone, Samsung customization app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> is one of the best go-to options, but you could only get them from the Galaxy Store—until today, that is.</p><p>As spotted by X user Litto Biju Pappachan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1785901103663714630" target="_blank">Tarun Vats</a>), the Good Lock app is now available to download from the Play Store.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung good lock is now on play store @choehau_alen @abhishek7h @theonecid @tarunvats33 pic.twitter.com/zaHPS1QfAC<a href="https://twitter.com/Litto31102469/status/1785888321434186145">May 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>We can confirm the app&apos;s availability via Google&apos;s app marketplace in regions like Southeast Asia. It might be rolling out to other regions too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:346px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.76%;"><img id="SgXhEjSc5BCJ3zBk36qp5j" name="Good-lock-play-store.jpg" alt="Good Lock listing on the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SgXhEjSc5BCJ3zBk36qp5j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="346" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app is listed as an Early Access download right now, which means it&apos;s not fully rolled out everywhere just yet. Samsung might be planning to make the app available in more regions over the next few weeks.</p><p>Good Lock is essentially a customization suite for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">favorite Samsung phones</a>. It includes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-good-lock-6-revealed">bunch of modules</a> that let you play around with things like your lock screen, notifications, and the app launcher.</p><p>Basically, it gives you the tools to personalize your phone and tweak how it works to better fit your style, using various plugins and customizable user interface elements.</p><p>It&apos;s not yet certain if the Google Play version of Good Lock will have every feature found on the Galaxy Store version. As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/good-lock-available-google-play-store/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the One Hand Operation Plus module is already on the Play Store with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.sidegesturepad&hl=en" target="_blank">own page</a>, hinting that some modules, like Home Up and LockStar, might need to be downloaded separately.</p><p>This move represents a big shift for Samsung since Good Lock has traditionally been exclusive to the Galaxy Store. That&apos;s fine for users who don&apos;t mind using Samsung&apos;s own platform, but it can be a hassle for those who prefer to get all their apps directly from the Play Store.</p><p>Listing Good Lock on the Play Store also opens it up to a wider audience who might not have known about it before. This could lead to more people discovering the customization options it offers, potentially boosting its user base.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s unclear when Good Lock will move out of Early Access. Samsung might still be running some tests and tweaking things before they go for a full-fledged launch.</p>

<p>Companies ship unfinished products, software, or hardware to meet the constant demand for "what&apos;s next." We&apos;re constantly looking for something that&apos;s better, faster, and stronger than what we already have. In turn, companies release devices that are either iterative, missing features, or just simply miss the mark.</p><p>These issues are being amplified even further, as a new product category is beginning to emerge. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and Humane AI Pin claim to offer a unique experience. However, it doesn&apos;t take long to notice that couldn&apos;t be further from the truth. Even still, because of the lack of innovation with smartphones, people, myself included, are throwing caution to the wind in favor of that "new and shiny" feeling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NHnrSVZBvApbbQkhjija9Y" name="z-fold-3.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NHnrSVZBvApbbQkhjija9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the most exciting segment of the phone market, foldables, has been plagued by the same problems. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-vs-galaxy-z-fold-3">Galaxy Z Fold 3, 4, and 5</a> are all pretty much the same, offering little more than a spec bump over the previous iteration. There aren&apos;t "generational leaps" anymore, and if they happen, it&apos;s several years down the line.</p><p>But a company can&apos;t wait a few years in between releasing something "new and shiny." Maybe Samsung or Apple could, but that would likely tank the stock prices, frustrating the shareholders, and who knows what would happen from there. </p><p>We, meaning the collective tech journalism industry, are quick to point out when a company falters. A recurring example is when a company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-thermometer-test">announces a product with certain features</a>, only to release said device <em>without</em> those features onboard. Instead, we&apos;re just told that "it&apos;s coming later in a software update."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuH2BnxUzHNhNqYWn2BcLM" name="made-by-google-pixel-8-event-ns-78.jpg" alt="Zoom Enhance feature on Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuH2BnxUzHNhNqYWn2BcLM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If we&apos;re lucky, it actually ends up appearing and works just as we were led to believe. But, more often than not, it&apos;s just half-baked, and even the average consumer can tell that it&apos;s not ready.</p><p>Basically, these multi-billion dollar companies are releasing unfinished products, promising things that aren&apos;t actually available at launch. "It doesn&apos;t make any sense," you may say. "They have all of this money; just follow through on the promises." They can&apos;t. Well, they could, but there are a lot of factors at play.</p><p>The first, which we already covered, is the need to keep up with demand. New and shiny means more profits, which makes the shareholders happy, which leaves us with boring products.</p><p>Another, and perhaps more important, is that while these companies might have endless supplies of money, they <em>don&apos;t</em> have endless supplies of people. To many, Google, Samsung, Apple, and the other giants aren&apos;t just faceless corporations being run by robots that rule the world.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Companies can't just "throw money" at the problem when it comes to releasing iterative devices every year. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There are people who have to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/recipe-for-successful-phone-launch-north-america">work on every aspect and facet</a> of everything that you touch and see when a new phone is shipped. That includes developing the hardware so that you can press the power button and turn the phone on. The software team needs to make sure that the boot logo appears and looks a certain way. Yes, it is a mundane example, but the point still stands.</p><p>You could even argue that smartphones have practically peaked in terms of power and capabilities. No, I&apos;m not saying that the current crop of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphones</a> is perfect. What I am saying is that there really isn&apos;t much more room when it comes to what a smartphone is capable of doing.</p><p>The counterargument to that doesn&apos;t have anything to do with the hardware, but instead, is the software. It&apos;s partially why companies are shifting their focus to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">AI and software</a>, as there&apos;s really not much left to do with the slabs of glass and metal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR" name="rabbit-r1-miyoo-mini-plus-game-boy-advance-sp.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 next to Miyoo Mini Plus and Game Boy Advance SP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyFrrdb6Rjkajnucyd5BCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This gives me a nice segue into this new wave of AI products that have started to appear. Nowadays, everywhere you turn, someone is talking about AI in one way or another. It&apos;s reached the point that companies are now releasing dedicated AI devices, with the Humane AI Pin and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rabbits-aosp-based-launcher-runs-on-android-phones-so-it-literally-could-have-been-an-app#xenforo-comments-1067723">Rabbit R1</a> seemingly at the center of it all.</p><p>Before going any further, I haven&apos;t used or seen the AI Pin at all, so I can only draw conclusions based on what I&apos;ve read and watched. With that being said, I have to say that it could end up being a bigger flop than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone/what-would-microsofts-windows-phone-look-like-in-2024-its-like-a-micro-pc-running-windows-12-in-your-pocket">Windows Phone</a> or LG&apos;s smartphone business.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong. In a vacuum, the technology powering the AI Pin sounds pretty incredible. I mean, you can turn your hand into an interactive display and control everything without taking your phone out of your pocket. But you know what almost works <em>just</em> as well? A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. Raise your wrist, ask Google a question, and get an answer without the need to worry about hallucinations. At least not yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2pnTxrjDVP7bjkkoU34fam" name="google-tasks-app-on-pixel-watch-2.jpg" alt="The Google Tasks widget on a Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pnTxrjDVP7bjkkoU34fam.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I digress.</p><p>The AI Pin was never going to be successful, even if the Humane team had managed to get Jony Ive on board. It costs as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> but <em>also</em> requires a $25 per month subscription. What happens if you don&apos;t pay for the subscription? You end up with a $700 paperweight. At least with the Pixel 8, you can still use it on Wi-Fi for practically everything.</p><p>Again, I haven&apos;t used this myself, but I do trust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">MKBHD&apos;s opinion</a> on the subject. And I believe him when he says it&apos;s the "worst product" he&apos;s ever reviewed.</p><p>As for the Rabbit R1, the overall premise is the same, as it&apos;s a dedicated "AI-powered" device. But instead of wearing it on your shirt or jacket, the R1 is closer to a smartphone in that you carry it with you in your pocket. And when you want to interact with it, you pull it out, press a button, and talk. Again, smartwatches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD" name="rabbit-r1-midjourney-fail.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 Midjourney fail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it, too, is a less-than-half-baked mess of a device. For something that&apos;s said to be so future-thinking, you couldn&apos;t even change the time zone. Thankfully, that was remedied with the first software update, along with other issues, but it shouldn&apos;t have been a problem to begin with.</p><p>While it&apos;s cool being able to ask it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-plans-to-enable-gemini-image-generation-soon">generate an AI image</a> using Midjourney, it&apos;s not exactly practical. If the Rabbit R1 is <em>really</em> supposed to be helpful, why can&apos;t I ask it to remind me to take the trash out? Why can&apos;t I use the Vision mode to add an item to my grocery list? Why can&apos;t I just set a 15-minute timer to check on what I&apos;m making for dinner?</p><p>Instead, Rabbit released a physical device that can&apos;t even do what the phone that I already have does. But just like Google, Samsung, and Apple, Rabbit is making the same promises, claiming that the cool features it showed off will be coming. At some point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb" name="humane-ai-pin-lifestyle-camo.jpg" alt="Humane AI Pin lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Humane)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Rabbit has a leg up on the AI Pin is that it&apos;s <em>just</em> $200. I know that&apos;s not an insignificant amount of money, but again, that&apos;s less than what I&apos;d be willing to pay for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch</a>. It&apos;s an accessory, not the main attraction.</p><p>The bigger problem is that since these enormous corporations have gotten away with treating their customers like guinea pigs, new companies are trying to do the same. Instead of just ignoring questions or pleading the fifth, they&apos;re hiding behind the premise of "we&apos;re just a startup" or "it&apos;s generative AI; it&apos;s always evolving."</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>If you need any more proof that we&apos;re the problem, just think about this: the Rabbit R1 was released, and five days later, it got its first update. In that time, reviews and impressions were released or published based on an unfinished product. Why not just delay the release by a week until after that update was available? Because even though this would&apos;ve been the right decision, the collective "we" would have lambasted it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The hamster wheel will continue to spin, and we'll keep chasing after any "fresh" morsel these companies dangle in front of us.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So, where do we go from here? Frankly, nothing is going to change. We&apos;re still going to want the best of the best every year, and companies are going to continue shoveling iterative hardware in our faces. New features may or may not be announced, but not all of them will be available at launch, or there will likely be arbitrary gatekeeping of some sort.  </p><p>Then, the collective "we" will write articles or publish videos expressing our dismay. All the while, profit margins will continue to rise because companies can make more money by recycling old parts, polishing them up, and presenting them as new. The hamster wheel will continue to spin, and we&apos;ll keep chasing after any "fresh" morsel these companies dangle in front of us.</p><p>And while the premise of the AI Pin and Rabbit R1 seems pretty cool, on paper, it&apos;s not practical. Not only can I get the same experience from my phone or watch, but I have even more flexibility thanks to the ability to download different apps. There are simply more options as I can bounce between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, ChatGPT, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/12-things-microsoft-copilot-can-do-on-windows-11-that-you-really-should-know-about">Copilot</a>, Perplexity, or all of them, right from the device that I already own. </p>

<hr>
<p>A new round of leaks shows that Spotify is still working on its HiFi audio tier and highlights what all users could experience once it arrives.</p><p>The leak was spotted in version 1.2.36 of Spotify on desktop by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/1ch6pzv/v1236_new_hifi_leak/">OhItsTom</a> on Reddit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-hifi-leaks-once-again-3439228/">Android Authority</a>). Details in the build show that Spotify plans to show whether a user&apos;s device is compatible or not with its lossless HiFi audio. The initial pane states that users can listen to their music in the "highest quality" (lossless) offline so long as they&apos;ve set their download settings to reflect it.</p><p>Additionally, another blurb states Spotify Connect will be the "best way" for users to enjoy their lossless audio. The company&apos;s early UI adds that "most devices (Bluetooth) can play music quality better than Very High" but such devices may not support lossless audio.</p><p>The leak continues with a quick look at Spotify&apos;s streaming quality addition of lossless audio. It suggests the company&apos;s HiFi audio will consume "up to" 1,411kbps when in use.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/1ch6pzv/v1236_new_hifi_leak">v1.2.36 - New Hi-fi Leak</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify">r/truespotify</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>A Redditor unearthed several screenshots showing how Spotify will likely highlight its lossless audio feature&apos;s arrival on mobile. The early screenshots suggest users can stream up to 24-bit wirelessly through Spotify Connect.</p><p>The post adds that Spotify seems to have swapped how it identifies the upgraded audio internally. It was discovered that the company now titles it "Enhanced Listening" instead of "HiFi," potentially signaling a branding shift.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotfy&apos;s HiFi tier with lossless audio for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-tier-code-deep-dive">a leak from September</a> showed what was planned subscription-wise. That previous leak showed Spotify&apos;s supposed plans for 24-bit Lossless music and the ability for users to create playlists using AI. The new plan may also deliver 30 hours of audiobook listening per month alongside some advanced mixing tools.</p><p>Spotify has continuously changed its name for this new tier, going from "Supremium" to 24-bit Lossless music and, now, "Enhanced Listening." It&apos;s still unclear when the platform plans to roll this out, but it looks like it&apos;s here to stay.</p>
