<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/sonos-launch-ace-headphones"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Sonos launched its first-ever headphones, "Ace," which look a bit like Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods-max-review">AirPods Max</a>. However, as a unique feature, an in-house engineered design allows the ear cups to be removed, making them easier to clean or swap out for new colors. These Bluetooth wireless headphones offer wired playback through the lone USB-C port. Out of the box, users will get one USB-C-to-USB-C and a USB-C-to-3.5mm to accommodate accessories that can be connected to the headphones.</p><p>Each cup has 40mm drivers and four microphones, which deliver active noise cancellation (ANC) in the &apos;Aware mode.&apos; The headphones come with Dolby Atmos support and can stream spatial audio content from supported services, including head tracking, wherever available. Later this year, Sonos says it will add "TrueCinema," a new tech that will map the space around you and create a virtual surround sound system to match your room.</p><p>The Sonos Ace comes in two colorways black or soft white, mirroring Sonos&apos; more color with its Era speakers. The company claims that the battery lasts up to 30 hours and will be available for pre-order for $449 starting May 21, with general availability on June 5.</p>

While Amazon hasn&apos;t set a price yet, it looks like this enhanced Alexa will require a separate monthly subscription beyond the annual $139 Amazon Prime fee.

<ul><li>Google created a new version of the Google Weather app in 2023 and started rolling it out on select Pixel devices. </li><li>Though the overhauled Google Weather app appeared on more Pixel phones and tablets running Android 14 later, it was still exclusive to Pixel.

<hr>
<p>Google is slowly but steadily updating all of its core apps to match the Material You design language, and Google Weather received that treatment last year. Initially, the redesigned Google Weather app was exclusive to Pixel phones and tablets, although it eventually reached a select few non-Pixel devices. Now, it looks like the refreshed Google Weather app is finally rolling out widely on more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/23/new-google-weather-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> was the first to notice the Google Weather app on more devices, after some users started seeing the overhauled app on their devices and posted to social media. These included phones from Samsung, OnePlus, and Honor. However, it was one user on X (formerly Twitter) that provided the most concrete evidence that the Google Weather app should be available on most Android devices. </p><p>That’s because the user claimed to have the new Google Weather “app” on a Nokia 4.2, which was running Android 11. Through an update to the Google app, this user now sees the same Google Weather design as seen on Pixels devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting, my old Nokia 4.2 got the new Google Weather "app" after an update to the Google app, today. This phone is on Android 11. I have never seen the new Google Weather on anything but a Pixel on Android 14, so it must be more widely rolling out. https://t.co/IXeyQvBCTA<a href="https://twitter.com/LBPHeretic/status/1793449748562645263">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Aside from the Material You design refresh, users will gain other benefits by getting the new Google Weather app. Of course, the approachable and colorful design is an advantage in itself for some, but there are practical advantages that came with the newly redesigned app, too. These include providing more data and using machine learning to make predictions for rain and precipitation. </p><p>Google sees an opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">improve weather forecasting using AI</a> and machine learning and has a research project concerning that very idea. For now, there are consumer-grade features that aim to provide more accurate predictions for precipitations using ML in the updated Google Weather app.</p><p>Since people are starting to see the redesigned Google Weather app on a slew of devices from various brands, it feels safe to say the redesign is rolling out in full force.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung will likely release a new foldable phone next to the Galaxy S25 series, according to an analyst.</li><li>It is expected to be called the Samsung Fold 6 Slim and will have a more prominent display than the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6.</li><li>The foldable is believed to be priced similarly to the flagship Z Fold 6 model. However, S Pen support is expected to be omitted.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is likely prepping for the next foldables release in the anticipated July Galaxy Unpacked event, where we expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 models. While there are solid rumors about another Z Fold 6 device, new information hints at an all-new model for next year.</p><p>Prominent display analyst Ross Young has shared some exciting details on X about an all-new Galaxy foldable smartphone likely to be dubbed Samsung Fold 6 Slim. It is believed to sport a bigger display than the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and should also be priced similarly to it. However, there seems to be no S Pen input, as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hearing about a Samsung Fold 6 Slim, Q4'24, bigger display than the Fold 6. Price probably similar to the Fold 6. No pen input.<a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1793683860406088050">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Young further indicates that the display panel for the Fold 6 Slim will be shipping in Q4 2024, and the foldable phone will likely hit the shelves in the first quarter of 2025, right alongside the Galaxy S25 series. Young also noted that they have the upcoming foldable’s cover and folding screen dimensions, which will likely be produced in their next Foldable Report.</p><p>The new information from Young sounds interesting, especially amid the rumors of a cheaper and more expensive foldable phone, which was hinted to launch alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Firstly, there have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-ultra-second-model-rumor">whispers</a> of a more premium Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra model, which was touted to be heavily priced compared to the current $1799 price tag. </p>

<p>Later on, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-make-a-cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-to-bring-foldables-mainstream-finally">speculations indicated</a> an affordable Galaxy Z Fold 6 may also be in the works, which is also expected to be a toned version of the Z Fold 6.</p><p>Meanwhile, another report from South Korea <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-stick-to-two-galaxy-foldables-as-before">indicated</a> that Samsung is sticking to the same two foldables this year, and the lack of differentiating factors is probably the primary reason to ditch its plans to bring an affordable Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>On the contrary, per Young, there is likely a new one coming at least next year, which is encouraging to see as the foldable phone market is clearly on the rise and not the other way around, as more OEMs are expected to debut their first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, too.</p><p>Of course, we should take this with a grain of salt for now, but if Samsung is indeed planning to launch a Z Fold 6 Slim, the phone would probably have to be priced well below the incoming model, which would likely be its "differentiating factor."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For better or worse, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">unleashed its search AI monster</a>. You&apos;ve probably seen it, you might have hated it, and you definitely have seen everyone complain about it. None of that matters — it&apos;s here to stay.</p><p>But it can&apos;t stay in its current form because it&apos;s too easy to break. That&apos;s the problem with AI; once it encounters something that requires a decision, it will make the wrong one as often as the right one. </p><p>So what can be done? Nothing easy, that&apos;s for sure. </p>
<p>Let&apos;s be realistic for a moment. It&apos;s fun to see everyone trying to break the AI and post the screenshots, but it&apos;s not that bad. As someone using it through the early closed beta and the Google Search Labs open beta, I can say you sort of get used to it and often ignore it.</p><p>It&apos;s easy to make Google say stupid things in the AI overview — just ask stupid questions. If you ask "normal" questions like "What&apos;s the weather?" or "Who signed the Manga Carta?" it spits out the right answer every time. If you want to know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">which Android phone is best</a>, it will give you a summary of one of the most popular reviews.</p><p>In any case, swiping past it is easy enough, and we&apos;ve been doing it to get past the ads, so we&apos;re used to it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:145.63%;"><img id="8tzMcayFAV2KADX9Jp5zH5" name="google-io-2024-gen-ai-search-video-question-ai-overview.jpg" alt="With a video and a user's query, Search's AI will deliver an AI Overview with relevant answers and troubleshooting methods." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tzMcayFAV2KADX9Jp5zH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="412" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will try to say it&apos;s not really an issue because of this, but that&apos;s not true; sometimes, you need an answer to a stupid question. When the AI comes across something it hasn&apos;t been well trained on, it has no idea what is fact versus fiction. The result is telling you to put glue on your pizza or another equally silly answer as a summary.</p>
<p>Those ridiculous ideas don&apos;t come out of thin air. Google has paid a lot of money to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/">scrape places like Reddit</a> for "knowledge," so its AI can try to have answers. If you&apos;ve been to Reddit, you know why this is a problem — Reddit is a cesspool of shitposting, where nonsense is given the same weight as sincere posts and replies.</p><p>If you ask Google a common question that it "understands," you&apos;ll get the right answer. When you ask about eating rocks, you get whatever some idiot at Reddit said about it. To be clear, I&apos;m not mad at the shitposters. I do my fair share of it. But Google AI doesn&apos;t understand the concept of shitposting and treats it as if it were serious. </p><p>This is a prime example of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-writing-bots-are-like-1000-monkeys-with-1000-typewriters">how dumb AI really is</a>: garbage in, garbage out. We&apos;ve already taught Google Search how to shitpost, and it&apos;s only been out for a few weeks. Now Google has to teach it to stop doing it on company time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.13%;"><img id="cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a" name="shitposting.png" alt="A social media screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cj2Nhi387j8P3ovzyjor9a.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1157" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to see for yourself. Ignore the cropped screenshots you see and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=african+country+that+starts+with+k&rlz=1C1UEAD_enUS1070US1070&oq=african+country+that&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDgwODhqMGo3qAIIsAIB&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">ask Google the same question</a>. After the AI summary, you&apos;ll find a link to the source material. Google isn&apos;t making these answers up and often quotes word for word from a page on the internet. When Google tells you Kenya doesn&apos;t exist, it&apos;s because someone at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37145312#:~:text=As%20of%20my%20last%20knowledge,with%20the%20letter%20%22K.%22">Hacker News</a> "taught" it that.</p><p>This is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">real issue for Internet publishers, too</a>. Some inside baseball: specialists work to try and game the system so Google&apos;s search algorithm finds their content and ranks it on the first page of search results. This is an entire industry, and the new AI snippets will disrupt it because the content will not be scraped or weighted the same way. Web publishers said the old text snippets would be doomsday for the same reasons, but it wasn&apos;t.</p><p>Now, SEO specialists will have to try to make sure the first paragraph of any webpage gets picked up by the AI. They&apos;ll figure it out, and instead of nonsense posts from Reddit, the summary will be from some SEO factory blog trying to sell you cheap crap that "everyone in your area can&apos;t live without." </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how is Google so god damn shitty at its job pic.twitter.com/bdx97oZNv6<a href="https://twitter.com/edzitron/status/1793751541394145771">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>So yeah, there&apos;s a lot wrong with AI search for both Google and web publishers. It&apos;s not easy to fix, either, but Google says it&apos;s taking in the feedback. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/google-ai-overviews-vast-majority-swift-action/">statement to 9to5Google</a>, a company spokesperson claims that the "vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information," while providing you links to dig deeper yourself in case you don&apos;t trust the AI to do it for you. They also noted that some of the examples circulating the web have been "doctored" or couldn&apos;t be reproduced by employees at the company.</p><p>"We conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we&apos;ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback," the spokesperson told 9to5Google. "We&apos;re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out."</p><p>Of course, the perfect solution is for Google to recognize expertise from typical internet garbage and properly filter out the nonsense to give you the answer. No matter how smart someone claims to be, a computer can&apos;t do that.</p><p>Google doesn&apos;t want to use living, breathing humans to sort through all this either because that would require an army of workers that Google doesn&apos;t want to pay for and be a logistical nightmare. In the end, Google created this mess and now has to spend some of those precious billions of dollars to work out the solution. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/googl/market-cap/">Sundar and the company can afford it</a>.</p><p>In turn, web publishers will need to stop relying on ways to game the system through SEO and write good, accurate content from experts hoping that Google picks it up once it "learns" the difference.

<p>Google Messages users are reportedly getting random gibberish texts that contain strings of characters and seem to show up as encrypted content.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> provides default end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the intended recipient can read the messages. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/s7drbq/received_an_encrypted_text_message/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-spam-encrypted-rcs-messages/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> shows that people are receiving RCS messages that look like spam.</p><p>These messages mostly look like gibberish, with random letters and numbers in no particular order. They likely appear this way because they couldn&apos;t be properly encrypted.</p>

<p>The original post in the thread is from two years ago, but it&apos;s recently gained a lot of new replies. According to these recent responses, many users are getting messages from outside their area code. That said, our own Derrek Lee confirms he received a similar gibberish message, but it came from within his own area code.</p><p>All the messages include the same legitimate link to Google’s support page on troubleshooting issues with decrypting encrypted messages.</p><p>For those who might not know, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">Google Messages uses Rich Communication Services</a> (RCS). It&apos;s a safer texting method than SMS and MMS. Plus, RCS offers end-to-end encryption for extra privacy.</p><p>Something seems to have gone wrong because users are now getting spam-like messages. To clear things up, there&apos;s a difference between the original issue in that thread and what&apos;s happening now. The original post was about a user who got a message from a contact that couldn&apos;t be decrypted. When the contact resent it, everything worked fine.</p><p>This time, the messages are coming from unknown senders, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be an isolated case. The texts are arriving from various countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon, Tanzania, and more, according to the report.</p><p>At the moment, there&apos;s not much information on where these posts are coming from, but Android Police believes it might be a rogue spambot. The outlet says this spambot is trying to find and collect active numbers through read receipts, and the gibberish messages we&apos;re seeing might be a glitch.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reportedly began working on a more powerful and efficient SoC, likely to be called Exynos 2600.</li><li>The chipset is under development with the codename “Thetis,” based on a figure from Greek mythology.</li><li>It will power the Galaxy S26 series, and Samsung plans to take the lead by launching the 2nm chip as soon as possible.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last year, Samsung shared plans to mass-produce its 2nm and 1.4nm process-based chipsets at its Foundry Forum event. Now, if a South Korean-based publication is to be believed, the company may have already started work on its next major chip as it aims to keep up with the competition.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240522000285">ETNews</a>, Samsung Electronics has already started the development of a 2nm chipset as competition with Apple and TSMC heats up. At the Foundry Farm last year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">said</a> it would mass-produce the 2nm process for mobile applications in 2025. The process is claimed to showcase a 12% increase in performance, a 25% increase in power efficiency, and a 5% decrease in total area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vHYCbaUqzvdBPkM8dBpqL4" name="exynos-generic.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos processor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHYCbaUqzvdBPkM8dBpqL4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the latest report, Samsung began the 2nm AP (application processor) project codenamed “Thetis,” which is believed to be the Exynos 2600 — the flagship chipset likely to debut with the Galaxy S26 series in 2026. </p><p>Assuming all goes well with testing, Samsung will reportedly be one of the first to bring the commercialized 2nm-based chip, following a likely 3nm chip arriving with the Galaxy S25 next year. It also means Samsung will compete against the Apple iPhone 17 series, which will likely be released next year with a 2nm-based chip.</p><p>This could also give Samsung a leg up in the race against TSMC as Qualcomm looks for a foundry that can produce a future Snapdragon chip. The report notes that Samsung intends to take the lead on 2nm chip production by launching its flagship chip as early as possible.</p>
<p>Samsung also opts for Snapdragon chips on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship devices</a> in some regions like the U.S. and Canada. However, the Exynos 2600 will probably be available in other regions globally as Samsung hopes to boost its in-house chips. </p>

<p>Your body&apos;s blood oxygen levels serve as a warning sign of sleep apnea, trouble adjusting to high altitudes, or even serious pulmonary medical conditions. Finger-based pulse oximeters are the most accurate for spot readings, but uncomfortable for sleep tracking. And you won&apos;t know if you need one unless you do some long-term monitoring first. That&apos;s where smartwatches with SpO2 tracking come in.</p><p>Blood oxygen monitoring is increasingly common on smartwatches these days. But not all pulse oximetry sensors are created equal, and many watches are limited on when (or how often) you can take readings. Continuous SpO2 tracking is rare to find, and burns through battery life quickly. And of course, Apple Watch owners will need to look elsewhere, due to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ban-saga-takes-another-turn-as-itc-hits-back-one-legal-expert-claims-masimo-clearly-abusing-patents">legal issues with SpO2 readings</a>.</p><p>Starting with the Garmin Forerunner 265, we&apos;ve rounded up some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> with blood oxygen monitoring. We&apos;ll focus on the best options related to battery life, frequency of readings, related health-tracking features, accuracy, and more.</p>

<p>Garmin watches, generally speaking, are your best option for testing blood oxygen data. While some watches only offer SpO2 spot checks or data during sleep, Garmin is the rare brand to offer an all-day mode, measuring every 5–15 minutes and targeting moments when it detects a lack of motion. During runs, when the results would be unreliable, it takes fewer readings. </p><p>Nearly any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> could claim this spot, since most have Pulse Ox readings and all-day mode. So why choose the Venu 3? It&apos;s one of the rare few to offer an ECG tool for AFib detection and skin temperature data during sleep data, as well as the usual accurate heart rate & heart rate variability (HRV) data. If you care about SpO2, you probably want as much other health data as possible. </p><p>In addition, the Garmin Venu 3 has the brand&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-announced">Sleep Coach</a> for judging your sleep quality, the enhanced Body Battery tool that detects what&apos;s draining your energy, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-garmin-watches-feature-jet-lag-adviser">Jet Lag Adviser</a> to judge your recovery during travel. It&apos;s missing Garmin&apos;s acclimation mode — which we&apos;ll explain with our next pick — but it&apos;s otherwise on the cutting edge for Garmin software.</p><p>More generally, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-can-measure-blood-oxygen-saturation-levels#section-how-to-choose">Garmin Venu 3 review</a> runs through its many positives compared to other Garmin watches, from its bright AMOLED display and more stylish design to its built-in mic and speaker for Bluetooth calls and voice assistant commands. You can even stream Spotify playlists. It&apos;s not as smart as your typical smartwatch, but it&apos;s as close as a fitness watch will get you. </p>

<p>Garmin watches tend to be expensive, so we chose the Venu 3 as the best smartwatch for blood oxygen data in part because it&apos;s "only" $450. If you can spare a little more, however, the Garmin Forerunner 965 is a better SpO2 option in three key respects. </p><p>First, the Forerunner 965 lasts 23 days in standard use. All-day SpO2 mode will significantly cut into that number, but you&apos;ll have more leeway than the 14-day Venu 3 will give you. If you only need spot checks or sleeping data, that might be less of a concern.</p><p>Second, only the Forerunner 965 has Garmin&apos;s Altitude Acclimation mode. When you&apos;re above 800 meters, it&apos;ll take averages of your blood oxygen, respiration rate, and resting heart rate to see how well you adapt to higher altitudes over three weeks. Serious athletes from climbers to marathoners could benefit from this tool.</p><p>Third, the Forerunner 965 has other cutting-edge fitness features for runners and cyclists. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Our Garmin Forerunner 965 reviewer</a> gushed over tools like training readiness, training load status, real-time stamina, and other metrics that helped him improve as a runner. </p><p>Aside from the high price, the downside to choosing the Forerunner 965, is that its last-gen Elevate v4 sensor lacks ECG spot readings and skin temperature data. Your choice may depend on whether you feel you need that information or not. </p>

<p>If you care about blood oxygen data, then you&apos;re <em>probably</em> also interested in other bodily health data, too. Most smartwatches track heart rate and SpO2, but if you need more information, then the Fitbit Sense 2 is an excellent choice to consider — if you don&apos;t mind paying for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>.</p><p>We&apos;ll note upfront that the Fitbit Sense 2 can&apos;t take SpO2 spot checks. That might be a dealbreaker for you! We&apos;re still including it because its SpO2 app automatically sends this data to the Fitbit app overnight. Long-term graphical data during sleep is arguably more useful than random spot-checks for people suffering from sleep apnea. Plus, you can export that data to your doctor from the app — something competing brands don&apos;t offer.</p><p>In addition, the Fitbit Sense 2 can catch irregular heart rhythm, both actively with the ECG and passively with the HR sensor. The latter also captures HRV data to determine overnight energy recovery. The Sense 2&apos;s continuous electrodermal sensor (cEDA) can detect your current stress levels, and your temperature sensor tests the quality of your sleep at night.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2 reviewer</a> praised the watch for its redesign compared to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-sense-review">Fitbit Sense</a>. It&apos;s narrower, more comfortable, has a physical button to select things instead of an annoying capacitive touch button that you had to squeeze and didn&apos;t always work, and uses a revamped UI that we liked. Plus, you have the benefit of Google&apos;s Fitbit acquisition in that it gets access to Google Maps and Google Wallet, something that regular fitness watches can&apos;t usually access.</p><p>You may also want to consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, which offers the same SpO2 tech and a similar battery life for half the price of the Sense 2. We only chose the Sense 2 over it because the Charge 6 technically is a fitness <em>tracker</em>, not a smartwatch.</p>

<p>Hands down, Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, with the Galaxy Watch 6 as our current favorite. Aside from loving the One UI 5 Watch interface, we really appreciate how Samsung stays at the cutting edge of health tracking.</p><p>With the Galaxy Watch 6, you can spot-check SpO2 data using the relevant Tile, or measure during sleep. There&apos;s no continuous SpO2 data, which would burn through the Watch 6 battery fairly quickly, but the first two blood oxygen options should suffice for many.</p><p>In addition to SpO2 data, Samsung also measures your heart rhythm, body composition, and skin temperature, and it&apos;s received FDA approval for passive AFib detection. Plus, it&apos;s been medically cleared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea detection</a> in the second half of 2024, which is one of the main reasons people track SpO2 data. </p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">our Galaxy Watch 6 review</a>, we did have occasional issues with deflated blood oxygen data at night, particularly on the heavy Classic. The smaller Galaxy Watch 6 is more likely to be comfortable for sleep data and adhere to your wrist more naturally. </p><p>While the Galaxy Watch 6&apos;s 40-hour battery is well below what Garmin or Fitbit provide, many people care more about getting apps, Google Assistant, and other smarts that a typical fitness watch could never offer. So we&apos;ve included it here as a more balanced pick compared to the other specialized entries. </p>

<p>Most smartwatches have Pulse Ox these days, but you can never be fully sure how accurate the readings are. While most smartwatches ask for FDA approval for the accuracy of their heart rate monitors, they don&apos;t do the same for their SpO2 sensors because they&apos;re much more difficult to get right. In fact, as far as we know, only one smartwatch has SpO2 tracking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K201456" target="_blank">FDA approval</a>: the Withings ScanWatch.</p><p>This isn&apos;t your traditional smartwatch with proper apps, but that ensures it can last 30 days per charge with automatic 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It has "clinically validated oxygen saturation" readings — taken at the UCSF Hypoxia Research Laboratory in San Francisco — that were "validated against the gold standard which involved blood oxygen samples analysis." In other words, you can trust that its SpO2 data is as medically accurate as a smartwatch can deliver.</p><p>The Withings ScanWatch combines this SpO2 data with HRM, breathing, and movement data for some of the best sleep tracking data and sleep apnea detection you can get from a device that isn&apos;t medical-grade. It can also detect AFib and offers some standard workout tracking, though not quite at the level of a Garmin or Fitbit.</p><p>Withings has since announced the ScanWatch 2, which added respiratory rate, overnight HRV, and 24/7 temperature tracking. Withings apparently didn&apos;t get clinical approval for SpO2 with this model, calling it a "wellness feature," but we assume it uses the same technology, so perhaps it&apos;s equally accurate. We can&apos;t be sure, so we&apos;re keeping the first-gen watch as our pick for now. </p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-need-a-fitness-smartwatch-with-blood-oxygen-monitoring-2">Why do you need a fitness smartwatch with blood oxygen monitoring?</h2>
<p>Hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels in your blood, is a serious condition caused by a variety of possible ailments. And without a pulse oximeter, you may not know that it&apos;s low blood oxygen that&apos;s causing the problem.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17727-hypoxemia" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>, symptoms can include headaches, shortness of breath, tachycardia, coughing, and (in extreme cases) bluish skin. Plus, of course, sleep apnea can cause other symptoms like poor and sweaty sleep, depression, and an inability to regain energy.</p><p>One common reason for low SpO2 scores at night is sleep apnea. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-sleep-apnea" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a> says that about 30 million people in the U.S. suffer from it, but only 6 million have a diagnosis for it. It goes unnoticed for many, hurting their sleep quality without them ever realizing it. But a smartwatch can detect these symptoms. </p>
<h2 id="which-garmin-watch-is-best-for-blood-oxygen-monitoring-2">Which Garmin watch is best for blood oxygen monitoring?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7C6zYLbiAGVRR7ZweyWwzV" name="Garmin-Instinct-2-Solar-Pulse-Ox.jpeg" alt="Pulse ox rating of 96% and heart rate on Garmin Instinct 2 Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7C6zYLbiAGVRR7ZweyWwzV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost every Garmin watch supports all-day SpO2 data, aside from a few older models. You may want to choose based on longest battery life, but long-lasting watches also tend to be bulkier, which could make sleep tracking less comfortable. It&apos;s about finding the right balance. </p><p>Athletes who need Garmin&apos;s altitude acclimation widget will typically find it on Garmin&apos;s priciest watches like the Fenix or Epix watches. For something a little more affordable, you could choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">2 Solar</a>, or any of the Forerunner 9X5 models. </p><p>If you&apos;re more generally looking for sleep quality data, the Venu 3 is a good option because of its solid battery life, Sleep Coach, and skin temperature data. But it&apos;s on the expensive side; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> will save you $200, lasts 11 days, and has a couple more running tools that you&apos;ll appreciate. Not a bad trade-off!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>Blood oxygen monitoring has become so commonplace in advanced smartwatches that you almost assume it&apos;ll be there. But beyond the physical presence of the sensor, it&apos;s just as important how the Pulse Ox actually works on your watch and how the software makes use of the data.</p><p>Both Fitbit and Garmin generally take a similar approach, silently collecting blood oxygen data and giving you a score or average of how well you&apos;re actually sleeping. The difference is that you can manually take a SpO2 reading on the Garmin Forerunner 265 whenever you want, while Fitbits mostly run behind the scenes. Either way, they&apos;ll give you a general sense if you&apos;re having trouble getting enough oxygen while sleeping, and their large batteries ensure running the Pulse Ox won&apos;t require daily charges.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch support nightly SpO2 readings as well, if you want a more traditional smartwatch experience. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Ultra 2</a> <em>used</em> to track SpO2 data before having to disable it for legal reasons, so iPhone owners will have to look elsewhere until Apple finds a more legally appropriate replacement. </p><p>You may also want to consider smart rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>. They typically measure SpO2 data passively at night, with a much more comfortable sleeping experience than you&apos;d get with a smartwatch. </p>

<ul><li>A Samsung contract given to repair shops has leaked and paints a sour picture as user data is reportedly involved.</li><li>Shops are seemingly required to upload a host of user data to Samsung's database when they come in for repair.</li><li>Samsung also requires repair shops to "disassemble" a user's device if it's discovered that they've used a third-party part.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information has surfaced regarding a leaked contract that reportedly details Samsung&apos;s requirement that repair shops divulge sensitive user information.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/samsung-requires-independent-repair-shops-to-share-customer-data-snitch-on-people-who-use-aftermarket-parts-leaked-contract-shows/">404Media</a> have reportedly obtained a Samsung contract to repair shops and have allegedly "confirmed" its validity. In its terms, shops must upload information "daily" about consumers who come in for repairs. The contract shows that Samsung requires shops to inform them about a consumer&apos;s name, contact information, phone identifier (IMEI number), and the details of their visit.</p><p>All of this supposedly goes into a Samsung database known as "G-SPN." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24163372/samsung-repair-snitch-aftermarket-parts">The Verge</a> states it has also seen information like this before in 2023.</p><p>The publication contacted Aaron Perzanowski, a law expert from the University of Michigan, about the matter. Perzanowski stated that "most consumers would be very surprised to learn that their personal information and details about their devices are being shared with the manufacturer," adding that "this looks like a substantial and unexpected invasion of consumer privacy."</p><p>The leak also shows that shops working with Samsung are required to "immediately disassemble" devices that may have been fixed previously with aftermarket parts. A portion of the agreement states that after disassembling, repair shops are to inform Samsung of the "details and circumstances" of the parts they&apos;ve discovered.</p>

<p>Under the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, consumers have the right to utilize third-party parts to repair their devices if necessary. This was confirmed by legal director John Bergmayer, according to 404Media.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung about the contract&apos;s details but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>This all comes to light following iFixit&apos;s announcement that it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">cutting ties with Samsung</a> due to its misaligned goals in device repairability. The company stated that the company had consistently glued its devices so tightly together that it forced it to sell parts similarly. Doing so resulted in iFixit having to drive up the costs for consumers instead of making them more affordable.</p><p>iFixit stated it had to sell batteries and screens in "pre-glued" bundles to try and maintain a high standard in parts. Despite its constant efforts to maintain such quality, the company stated it could do it no longer.</p><p>The company will officially part ways with the Korean OEM in June but will continue to attempt to acquire parts for Galaxy devices when possible.</p>

<p>YouTube Music is starting to roll out a feature on Android that lets users utilize their voice to search for songs they can&apos;t get out of their heads.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/youtube-music-song-search-android/">9to5Google</a>, users should begin noticing a wavelength icon beside the microphone symbol when tapping search in YouTube Music (to the far right of the search bar). As of update 7.02, tapping the wavelength symbol produces a colorful page that prompts users to "play, hum, or sing" a tune to run an AI-backed search through the platform. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.94%;"><img id="ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM" name="YouTube-Music-song-identification.jpg" alt="New button to identify a song in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="399" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> gets a match, users are given a simple splash page with all the information about the song. The "results" page shows a song&apos;s album cover, title, group (or artist), and the album&apos;s title with its debut year. Moreover, users can play the song right there or save it to a new or pre-existing playlist.</p><p>YouTube Music&apos;s new song identification can continue as the platform offers the same wavelength symbol at the bottom. Its reappearance lets users restart the search process instead of backing out into the app&apos;s search page.</p><p>The publication adds that users can also download the song, which is likely an option tucked into the three-dot menu.</p>

<p>While the new song identification has been spotted in version 7.02 of YouTube Music, the feature is reportedly activated via a server-side update. In the meantime, users should ensure they&apos;re running the latest app version. Despite running software version 7.02.51 we haven&apos;t noticed the feature yet.</p><p>Users will be familiar with the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">humming to search</a> for a song as the Google app has had it for a few years now. You&apos;re able to hum, sing, or even whistle, and Search will try and match the melody to the correct song. Similarly, a type of song identification hit Pixels a few months ago, letting the device keep its ears open to songs. Through "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a>," Pixel phones can identify what song is playing if enabled and can notify the user so they&apos;re not dreading it later.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">Gemini extension</a> finally arrived for Android and desktop users yesterday (May 23). After connecting their YouTube Music account, users can begin asking the AI to find specific songs made by an artist they&apos;re familiar with. Asking Gemini to "play" a song works on Android, however, it&apos;s not functioning properly on the web yet.</p>
