<ul><li>YouTube Music wants to show what your subscribed artists are up to.</li><li>The app is rolling out a new Activity feed, which shows new singles and albums from subscribed artists.</li><li>The feature is currently rolling out for Android and iOS users, but web users have to wait.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music for Android and iOS is getting a new feed dubbed "Activity" that shows up when users hit the notifications bell icon in the music app.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/09/youtube-music-notifications-bell/">9to5Google</a>, it was spotted in the YouTube Music app last month. However, it appears to be rolling out widely to all the app users on both iOS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="D2SrGftM9eyVHWVuEMjzC5" name="Youtube-music-activity-feed-01.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Activity feed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2SrGftM9eyVHWVuEMjzC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Currently, the YouTube Music app has a notification bell icon, which can be viewed at the top when users are in the "Home" tab. This icon was generally used to roll out app notifications like every other app. However, users would see the new "Activity" feed after the latest update rollout, which shows "updates from artists you subscribe to and other activity will be shown here."</p><p>As 9to5 points out, the Activity feed is showing new singles and albums from the artists that users are subscribed to in reverse chronological order for now. When the rollout becomes more widely available to users, we might see more features added to it, like the ability to see new podcasts from their subscribed channels.</p><p>Also, the feed is likely to be grouped weekly or monthly as it currently shows some of the artists&apos; work under the "This week" section. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="PTR3ohTaqQ5itxm7eA95K5" name="Youtube-music-activity-feed.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Activity feed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTR3ohTaqQ5itxm7eA95K5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right under the new Activity feed, YouTube Music app users can also find the "Suggested for you" feed, where they can subscribe to their favorite artists for whom they haven&apos;t subscribed. As 9to5 notes, this feed is presumably based on their music listening history.</p><p>Artist activity is a familiar feature. Spotify and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> provide a similar feed highlighting the music artists enjoy, particularly the musicians they have followed.</p><p>As for the rollout, it is currently appearing on the YouTube Music app as aforementioned, and it is nowhere to be seen on the YouTube Music for web just yet.</p>

<p>Sure, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is great and all, but if you want a phone with a built-in stylus and you don't want to drop over $1,000, the Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) is an awesome choice. In addition to the built-in accessory that gives the phone its name, you get a vibrant 120Hz display, fast Qualcomm Snapdragon performance, 20W charging speeds, and stereo speakers straight out of the box. </p>
<p>Grab the unlocked 256GB version of the phone and you'll score a straight $150 on your purchase, no strings attached. If you choose to activate the phone through your carrier, Best Buy will drop the price down even further, to a mere $149.99.  </p>

<p>For just $250, you&apos;re getting a stylus phone with a vibrant 6.6-inch 120Hz display, some surprisingly great camera tech, and a 5,000mAh battery that should last all day with ease. And as we note in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">our 4-star review</a>, you&apos;ll be enjoying fluid performance that rivals some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> that money can buy.</p><p>This $150 discount is for the unlocked version of the phone, but if you choose to activate the device through a carrier on Best Buy&apos;s website, you&apos;ll score an additional $100 in savings. That knocks the price of the Moto G Stylus 5G down to a mere $150, no trade-in required.</p><p>Of course, as with most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-best-motorola-deals-of-month-year-save-big-on-foldable-phones-flagships-and-more">Motorola deals</a>, don&apos;t expect a ton of software support with the Moto G Stylus 5G (2023). The stylus here is also pretty basic, there&apos;s no IP rating, and we weren&apos;t particularly impressed by the phone&apos;s selfie camera. Lastly, it&apos;s worth remembering that Motorola will probably drop the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) at some point later this year (probably late summer), so if you can wait, that phone is likely to be superior to this model.</p><p>Still, if you want a great stylus phone experience today and you don&apos;t want to deal with Samsung&apos;s hefty price tags, this Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) deal might be the perfect choice.</p>

<p><em>As we mentioned above, the Moto 5G Stylus doesn&apos;t come with an IP rating, so if you want to keep your new phone extra safe, consider buying one of the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-cases-for-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023"><em>best Moto G Stylus 5G cases</em></a><em> before your package arrives. </em></p>

I was addicted, and the only cure was one more round. C-Smash VRS is the epitome of an arcade classic, redesigned and reformulated for at-home VR systems after decades of relegation to now-defunct arcades.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a Sega classic from the instant you start it up, with music by Rez veterans and addictive, high-score-based gameplay to match. But this isn&apos;t the only time I&apos;ve found myself practically addicted to a VR game where I smash a ball with some kind of racket.</p><p>Before C-Smash, it was Racket Club, a social Squash/Pickleball hybrid with a community that&apos;s as friendly as it is competitive and immediately landed on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/12">best Meta Quest games</a> when it debuted last Fall. Beyond these two titles, there&apos;s a notable enthusiast community that loves playing other racket games like Eleven Table Tennis, Pickleball One, Cybrix, Racket Fury, and several others.</p><p>Like Wii Sports, games that revolve around existing sports tend to be the most accessible experiences because you don&apos;t have to re-teach gamers what to do. People already know how to hit a ball with a tennis racket or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">a golf club</a>, and like the Wii, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> enhance the experience and make it feel even more real.</p>

<p>C-Smash VRS originally launched as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> exclusive game last Spring. It&apos;s a complete reimagining of the classic Dreamcast game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfnCyHqbc4Y">Cosmic Smash</a>, which puts players on one side of a Squash-sized court while blocks are placed on the other side.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever played the classic Atari game Breakout — or one of its many clones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=breakout.brick.breaker.classic">on the Google Play store</a> — you&apos;ll immediately understand the concept. It&apos;s your job to lob the ball across the court and take out the targets as fast as possible. C-Smash is a classic arcade game through and through, awarding high scores and worldwide leaderboard placement for the best players.</p><p>The single-player campaign sees you making your way through the stars with its quirky Space Channel 5-esque sci-fi theme that feels a bit like it came out of the 1960s. Before the rounds begin, you&apos;ll choose your pathway through a randomized solar system that&apos;s filled with power-up planets, each of which will present a different challenge to clear out bricks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the soundtrack is superb, ushering in a wave of catchy tunes and funky beats by the ever-amazing DJ Ken Ishii. If you don&apos;t immediately recognize the name, know that he was behind the soundtracks for Sega classics like Lumines and Rez. The game feels Sega through and through, and for a guy who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I&apos;m all here for it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As a kid who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I'm all here for C-Smash's incredible soundtrack and arcade gameplay.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each planet features a different court theme and power-ups like multiball will no doubt excite pinball fans as they watch dozens of balls explode from those special bricks and clear out the entire court in seconds. I managed to get a top-5 high score worldwide in one of these multiball rounds before C-Smash VRS went public on Quest last Friday, although I doubt I&apos;m still on the leaderboard at this point.</p><p>Because each court is wider than you&apos;ll likely be able to move in your home space, you&apos;ll use the left controller stick to slide your character left and right to help yourself reach even the widest shots from the backplane.</p><p>I played the game on the PSVR 2 when it came out but decided I wasn&apos;t a fan of games that make you move around as much, given that the PSVR 2 has a cable I tend to trip over. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is completely wireless, I never once felt like I was being pulled out of the experience just to remember not to trip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But C-Smash isn&apos;t just a single-player experience, and for me, that&apos;s where the real longevity comes into play. C-Smash VRS features several different multiplayer modes that put players on courts that face each other, tasking them with clearing or claiming all the bricks before the other player.</p><p>The mode&apos;s one weakness is that there&apos;s no cross-play at the moment, but the team confirmed that it&apos;s something they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/1bg5b9o/comment/kv6d814">looking at implementing</a> in the future. In fact, that very Reddit thread outlines a new C-Smash Saturday meetup program the team at RapidEyeMovers holds every Saturday at 1pm PT / 4pm ET / 8pm GMT. It&apos;s perfect if you&apos;re looking for a little mid-day breakup of a lazy Saturday and it&apos;s sure to get your heart pumping.</p>
<h2 id="the-wii-sports-effect-2">The Wii Sports effect</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.82%;"><img id="qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6" name="wii-sports-tennis.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Wii Sports tennis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1847" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that Wii Sports sold more Wii consoles than any other game. The game was a free pack-in with every Wii sold in the West, proving the importance of including an accessible, killer app with every system.</p><p>Everyone loved Wii Sports. Gamers, non-gamers, young people, old people, etc. It was a game that brought people together for some fun physical activity in the living room and was instantly playable no matter your skill level. The game felt like pure magic and its influence can be spotted in many VR games to date.</p><p>In the same way, many VR sports games can offer extremely accessible gameplay by keeping things simple. C-Smash VRS is slightly more complicated than something like Wii Sports because it&apos;s more "video gamey," but that&apos;s why there are games like Racket Club.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHwNrFR2Fiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>When you start up Racket Club, you&apos;re not greeted with a complicated menu system or a lot of nonsense hoops to run through. You can immediately head out the door and be placed into a public lobby filled with players ready to show you the ropes. The game instantly makes sense and it only takes a few seconds to understand the nuances that make it different from other racket games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Racket Club's friendly community is as good as the game itself.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just like C-Smash, you&apos;ll be hitting a ball with a racket and bouncing it off a wall, but unlike C-Smash, your opponents will hit the ball right back at you. Each court is only as big as the play space you&apos;re standing in which means you won&apos;t need to virtually move your character around with a joystick.</p><p>The latest update lets you customize and adjust the racket itself, too, helping players of all kinds feel comfortable holding the virtual racket the way they want to. I always take some time to adjust to each racket game&apos;s holding angle, so this was a particularly refreshing update for me.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZu-TcE4JDQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Racket Club&apos;s endearing fan base ensures you&apos;ll always have a good time. Players have always been super friendly and talkative, willing to play a few practice rounds to warm you up, and even gracious when they lose.</p><p>Unironically, it comes from the same developers that put together Demeo, a game that boasts one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">friendliest online communities</a> I&apos;ve ever experienced. The internet is filled to the brim with jerks and trolls, but I have yet to have a bad experience with either of these titles from Resolution Games.</p><p>But while Wii Sports&apos; gameplay largely plateaus after a short time, Racket Club&apos;s simple-to-learn mechanics are more rewarding the more time you put into the game. The game has a true experience curve that feels realistic in both single-player and multiplayer modes, thanks to the company&apos;s unique use of deep learning AI for its computer-controlled players.</p><p>That means no matter if you want to play through the game&apos;s deep single-player campaign mode or head straight online and play against real human players, you&apos;re bound to have a rewarding experience. Couple that with the safety that mixed-reality gameplay delivers — you can play far better when you&apos;re not worried about smashing your TV — and it&apos;s clear that Racket Club is the Wii Sports Tennis successor we&apos;ve been looking for.</p>

<ul><li>Google plans to shut down the VPN service included with Google One subscriptions.</li><li>The company said that it found that the Google One VPN was underutilized, which is why it is being removed. </li><li>Notably, Pixel owners and Google Fi subscribers will still have access to their included VPN services. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google bundles a few virtual private network (VPN) services with its other offerings, but one of those is going away soon. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-and-use-your-google-one-vpn">Google One VPN</a>, the VPN service included with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription tiers, will shut down in the coming months. Luckily, the company will not make any changes to the other VPNs it offers through other programs, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Pixel phone</a> purchases or Google Fi cellular plans. </p><p>The move was communicated to Google One subscribers Thursday, April 11 in an email viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. "With a focus on providing the most in-demand features and benefits, we&apos;re discontinuing free shipping for select print orders from Google Photos starting on May 15 and VPN by Google One later this year," the email said. </p><p>Google&apos;s idea with the Google One VPN was to bolster its subscription offerings while fulfilling a need for privacy on the web. The feature was first a perk of the Google One Premium plan, but it has been available on all Google One plans since early last year. However, the feature wasn&apos;t all that popular, at least according to Google.</p><p>The company is "discontinuing the VPN feature as [it] found people simply weren&apos;t using it," according to a statement provided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. </p><p>Again, Google reiterated the need to shift focus toward features that Google One subscribers make the most out of. This is the same reason the company gave when it decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">cut 17 features from Google Assistant</a> in January.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lfmu83VeF7xuET9RXHy7hE" name="google-one-vpn-pixel-7-pro-2.jpg" alt="Google One VPN on Pixel 7 Pro - angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lfmu83VeF7xuET9RXHy7hE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Google is keeping its original promise to owners of Pixel 7 series phones and newer. A separate VPN service, called Pixel VPN, is included on those devices for five years. Even with the discontinuation of the Google One VPN, the Pixel VPN will still be available. In fact, Google is expanding Pixel VPN to run on the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold without needing the Google One app. This functionality first appeared on the Pixel 8 series and is making its way to older devices in June. </p><p>The VPN included with Google Fi cellular plans is also unaffected, meaning that there are still a few ways to get VPN service through Google. However, anyone reliant on the Google One VPN who doesn&apos;t have a new Pixel or Google Fi service will need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn-apps-android">switch to another provider</a>. </p>

<p>YouTube is experimenting with new ways to show video players on the web, and the latest one could represent one of the biggest UI changes in years. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-show-you-shorts-in-more-places-on-the-web">YouTube Shorts</a> started appearing in the recommended videos sidebar for some users. Now, an even more drastic change is showing up for a limited number of users. The latest redesign test moves the title, description, and comments to the sidebar and shifts recommended videos under the currently playing one.</p><p>Though this user-interface change is indeed only a test, users aren&apos;t thrilled about it for now. The redesign drew the attention of all the major social media sites, including X (formerly Twitter), Threads, and Reddit. One user on Threads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@_brianhamilton/post/C5lsnJMJbVN/?xmt=AQGzVSzhTSKNliKn4PQrXcdcKf5YRpgXU_JyW9a9yL3KYg" target="_blank">Brian Hamilton</a>, shared a screenshot of the visual overhaul, and over 100 mostly negative replies ensued. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.19%;"><img id="A4ZdkP7yqezwgGJtVAvFXi" name="YouTube-Sidebar-Redesign-Test.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a YouTube redesign test." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4ZdkP7yqezwgGJtVAvFXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="1408" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: _brianhamilton / Threads)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The benefit of this change appears to be that you get to see more of the video title, comments, and description. Meanwhile, less recommended videos appear on the same page as your now-playing content. Instead of a long list of recommended videos with smaller thumbnails and titles, YouTube shows three recommended videos with larger thumbnails and titles in this test.</p><p>However, users responded to this change in a similar way to YouTube&apos;s last test with YouTube Shorts. In both cases, the bigger thumbnails for recommended videos were found to be distracting from the main content. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">jumping in! it sounds like you’re seeing an experiment/test feature. diff teams at YouTube often test new ways to improve features & experiences. you can share your feedback here: https://t.co/NnQpe4fbHH also, you can check out recent experiments here: https://t.co/p3uu6MOOr2<a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1778196636113531115">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Team YouTube account on X clarified that this is an experimental test feature that isn&apos;t rolling out for everyone yet. The account advises users to submit their feedback through their YouTube account. To do so, users can click on their profile picture on the YouTube site and select <strong>Send feedback</strong>. After writing feedback or including a screenshot, you can hit <strong>Send</strong> to submit your thoughts to Google. </p><p>Although the redesigned YouTube video player isn&apos;t available to all users and Google accounts on the web, the social media buzz around the change suggests that it is somewhat widespread. Currently, it looks like YouTube is testing a few new ways to improve the web video player, so we&apos;ll be curious to see which—if any—of these tests survive. </p>

<p>We already saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-camera-changes-rumor">hints about the cameras</a> and screen resolution of Sony&apos;s upcoming Xperia 1 VI, but now fresh renders show the phone&apos;s design, and it might ditch the super tall screen Xperia phones are known for.</p><p>Prolific leaker @OnLeaks dropped some sweet renders of the upcoming Sony Xperia 1 VI, giving us a good idea of what Sony&apos;s next flagship model looks like (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-sony-xperia-1-vi-leak" target="_blank">AndroidHeadlines</a>). It looks like there might be a change in the screen ratio for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-phones">Sony&apos;s flagship phones</a>, judging from these images.</p>

<p>The design stays true to Sony&apos;s signature boxy style, just like we saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a>. And the camera setup at the back seems pretty familiar, with three lenses lined up vertically. Furthermore, the ZEISS branding appears to be making a comeback.</p><p>These renders give us a good look at the dimensions of the Xperia 1 VI, and it seems like we&apos;re dealing with a device that&apos;s pretty familiar in terms of size. The measurements come in at about 161.9 x 74.5 x 8.4mm, as per the leaker.</p>

<p>Those numbers might not mean a lot on their own, but when we stack them up against last year&apos;s Xperia 1 V, things start to get interesting. Compared to its predecessor, the new Xperia 1 VI looks like it&apos;ll be a tad thicker, but it&apos;ll also be a bit shorter and wider. So, we&apos;re looking at a more compact and conventional setup this time around.</p><p>With this slight size tweak, there&apos;s a chance the phone&apos;s aspect ratio could shift to 19.5:9. Now, there&apos;s been chatter that Sony might ditch the beloved 21:9 display for the first time since it introduced the Xperia 1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-xperia-5">Xperia 5</a> series back in 2019. If that turns out to be true, fans who dig that 21:9 aspect ratio might feel a bit let down by Sony&apos;s call.</p><p>Xperia phones have been rocking a 21:9 ratio for a while. But, with leaks hinting that Sony might be switching things up to a more standard 19.5:9 screen, like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, it&apos;s starting to look like this change is pretty much locked in.</p><p>The new Xperia phone is also rumored to come with a 2K+ or Quad HD+ display, rocking around 3200 x 1440 pixels. That&apos;s a step down from the 4K panels we&apos;ve seen in previous models.</p><p>The upcoming phone is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors" target="_blank">pack a 2K+ or Quad HD+ panel instead of a 4K panel</a> in the previous models.</p><p>Pinning down the exact resolution just from a render might be a bit of a stretch. And as for that aspect ratio change we&apos;re speculating about based on the leaked Sony Xperia 1 VI render, well, only time will tell if it&apos;s the real deal.</p>

<p>When it comes to tablets and foldables, it&apos;s tough to argue against the idea that Samsung is offering the best experience. Samsung&apos;s "everything but the kitchen sink" approach is finally paying off in a big way now that we&apos;re out of the dark days of TouchWiz. And while the company continues to improve the software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> remains a key selling point for those who want a truly "all-in-one" device, which is why I think it should be the default on tablets.</p><p>DeX flies under the radar, as it&apos;s almost never mentioned whenever a new flagship device is unveiled. However, changes and improvements are regularly made in an effort to let you turn your device into a portable computer.</p><p>The most recent overhaul came with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a>, which introduced the "New DeX" interface. Instead of being provided with a completely different Home Screen and interface, New DeX basically feels like a super-charged version of what you get out of the box on something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You might even have a hard time noticing that you're even using "New DeX."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When activated, your Home Screen remains the same, including your app layout and any widgets that you might have added. But, as soon as you open an app, you&apos;ll immediately notice something different. Instead of the app taking up your entire screen, as it did before, it opens up in an app window, like it would if you were using "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Classic DeX</a>."</p><p>This is great for those who want to open multiple apps at the same time without dealing with the annoyances of split-screen. You still have access to those capabilities, but essentially, you&apos;re given much more flexibility than the traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> experience. The taskbar also remains persistent, but even your notifications and Quick Settings toggles are available just by swiping down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-desktop.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on desk in DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m hoping for is that Samsung will introduce this "New DeX" as the default interface on new tablets and maybe even foldables like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It combines the best of both worlds, giving us the ability to use widgets on the Home Screen while making it easy to open multiple apps in their own separate windows. Then, Samsung can ditch the "New" and "Classic" monikers while still giving us access to both.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think this is what&apos;s actually going to happen. Instead, I&apos;m of the mindset that Samsung is going to end up ditching the DeX that we&apos;ve all come to know and love over the years. The "New DeX" will just become "DeX," while the stock launcher experience will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a fan of the "Classic DeX" interface, then you might be a bit concerned that it&apos;s going away. Thankfully, that&apos;s not the case, at least for the time being. Samsung makes it possible to switch from "New" to "Classic," but you&apos;ll have to do a little bit of digging.</p><p>This New DeX experience also doesn&apos;t replicate a desktop experience as well, especially if you connect your tablet to an external monitor. For one, the only display settings option is to choose between "Mirror tablet screen" or "Use screens separately." Even if you choose the latter, New DeX doesn&apos;t scale the display properly, meaning that you&apos;re often left with black bars on either side.</p>

<p>By in large, this just automatically enables the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/use-multi-window-mode-samsung-galaxy-tab-s8">Multi window for all apps</a>" feature that&apos;s already available in the Labs section of the Settings app. There are a few other minor differences, such as the taskbar being able to hold more than four recently used apps. But, it&apos;s not really something that I would describe as being part of the "DeX" experience.</p><p>You might be asking yourself, "Would Samsung actually ditch "Classic DeX?" Well, the answer is quite simple. Yes, because it likes to make money. Samsung already sells its own lineup of laptops, and if you buy a tablet that basically does the same thing as a laptop but has better battery life, it loses out on potential sales. This is especially true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> with its 14.6-inch AMOLED display, and when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">Book Cover Keyboard</a>, it is about as close as it gets to having an Android-powered Surface competitor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Book 4 360</a> is probably the closest comparison to make, as it&apos;s a 2-in-1 laptop with a touchscreen display. Pricing starts at $1,099 for the Intel Core 5 model, paired with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. There&apos;s also the Core 7 variant, priced at $1,349, but that bumps the RAM up to 16GB and comes with either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn" name="samsung-galaxy-book-4-series-press-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 4 series lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1392" height="783" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, on the other hand, starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage, maxing out with 1TB for $1,619. Then, you&apos;re looking at another $350 for the Book Cover Keyboard, so on the surface, the Book 4 360 is a better deal. But that&apos;s only part of the story, as the Book 4 360 falls short of the Tab S9 Ultra in a few ways.</p><p>For one, while the screen is larger, it&apos;s also limited to a 1080p resolution and is capped at a 60Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the Tab S9 Ultra is equipped with a smaller display, making it better for portability, along with offering a better viewing and gaming experience thanks to the AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Not to mention that the battery on your Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra will last for days, whereas the Book 4 360 <em>might</em> make it through a day, maybe two.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra might be expensive, but it's still a better value than some of Samsung's best laptops.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I wish I could tell you what the future holds and that Samsung will leave Classic DeX alone, aside from introducing new features. Sadly, I don&apos;t have a crystal ball and have no clue what Samsung&apos;s long-term plans are with New DeX.</p><p>But there&apos;s a reason why I barely ever recommend anything other than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a> to those who don&apos;t want an iPad. That&apos;s because the majority of Android tablets are a mixed bag of disappointment. Whether it&apos;s because they lack polish, aren&apos;t updated very often, or are just downright bad. Unless something dramatic happens, Galaxy Tabs will remain my go-to recommendation, even if "Classic DeX" is removed, but it will be much tougher.</p><p>Samsung, please don&apos;t ruin a good thing, even if your analytics show that DeX isn&apos;t used by the vast majority of the user base.</p>

However, searching for that specific photo can be daunting when you have amassed a huge library over the years, especially with many duplicate or similar-looking shots. Thankfully, the company released a new feature called Photo Stacks in November 2023 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, which helps you better organize all your duplicate pictures. </p><p>In case you haven&apos;t been using this feature already, we&apos;ll show you how to easily enable and manipulate your similar-looking photos using Photo Stacks in Google Photos, so that your library view is well organized. No matter if you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> or a really cheap one, this feature works for all. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-photo-stacks-in-google-photos-2">How to enable Photo Stacks in Google Photos</h2>
<p>1. Open the Google Photos app. </p><p>2. In between the highlight carousel and the last photo you took, you&apos;ll notice <strong>three vertical dots</strong> on the right side of the app. Tap it. </p><p>3. This will open a pop-up menu from below, where the first toggle item should say <strong>&apos;Stack similar photos&apos;</strong>. Simply enable this. </p><p>4. Close the menu and go back your gallery view where you have multiple photos taken within quick succession. You&apos;ll notice just one of those photos is now visible, with a little number and symbol in the top corner, letting you know how many photos are stacked. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.50%;"><img id="Xe8pKXFocHF9bcbHwzgagJ" name="Use-Photo-Stacks-Google-Photos-1.jpg" alt="Photo Stacks in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xe8pKXFocHF9bcbHwzgagJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="745" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Photo Stacks only works for photos that are backed up to the cloud. Learn how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">use Google Photos to backup your media</a>. It could also take some time to stack recently taken photos, so check back in some time to see if it&apos;s done. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-manipulate-photos-in-a-photo-stacks-xa0-2">How to manipulate photos in a Photo Stacks </h2>
<p>Now that you have similar photos grouped together, you can do all sorts of things like change the top pick, share selected photos from the stack or all of them, or simply keep one photo and delete the rest. </p><p>To view all the photos in a stack, simply <strong>tap the photo</strong> and you&apos;ll see thumbnails of the extra images in a carousel below. Tapping each thumbnail will show you a larger preview of that photo. </p><p>To view all the photos in a stack at once, simply tap the <strong>logo with the four squares</strong>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.50%;"><img id="N5DgrbBNMryxyHtMacakWn" name="Use-Photo-Stacks-Google-Photos-2.jpg" alt="Photo Stacks in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5DgrbBNMryxyHtMacakWn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="745" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To <strong>change the Top pick</strong>, you can long-press the other photo in the stack and choose <strong>&apos;Set as top pick&apos; </strong>from the options below. Now, this will be the photo that shows up in your library view. </p><p>In the same menu, you&apos;ll see <strong>&apos;Remove from stack&apos;</strong> next to &apos;Set as top pick&apos;. This will simply move it out of the stack and show it as another photo in the gallery, but it won&apos;t delete it. </p><p>To delete a photo or several photos from the stack, you can either manually select all the photos and tap <strong>&apos;Delete from device&apos; </strong>from the bottom menu, or you can select just the photo you want to keep and choose the <strong>&apos;Keep 1, delete rest&apos;</strong> option in case there are many photos in the stack. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A word of caution. Once you remove a photo from a stack or choose to unstack the entire group of photos, you get an <strong>Undo </strong>pop-up option for a few seconds. However, after this, there is no way to re-stack those photos. Even toggling the main Photo Stack option on and off won&apos;t help. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-share-photo-stacks-in-google-photos-xa0-2">How to share Photo Stacks in Google Photos </h2>
<p>1. You can share a single image or all the images from a stack pretty easily. </p><p>2. When you long-press a stack from the gallery view and tap share, you&apos;ll get an option for <strong>1 item </strong>or <strong>XX items </strong>(where XX is the number of photos in the stack). </p><p>3. Selecting the first option will only share the single, top-pick image. </p><p>4. The second option will share all the images in the stack. </p><p>5. If you need to share a single photo from the stack that&apos;s not the top pick, simply <strong>open the stack</strong>, <strong>choose the photo</strong> from the thumbnail view, and then <strong>tap Share</strong>. </p>

<p>Google Photos is an incredibly versatile app for organizing your media, and the best part is that it&apos;s free. As of May 15, 2024, the app is about to get even more powerful as Google announced that it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-expands-ai-editing-features">bringing all its AI editing tools for free</a> for everyone to use. This means you&apos;ll be able to use features like Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Portrait Light, and others, even if you don&apos;t have a Google One cloud subscription. </p><p>Photo Stacks is a terrific addition to Photos and something everyone should use. It makes your gallery view less cluttered, so you can find the photo you&apos;re searching for much quicker. </p>

<hr>
<p>Hot on the heels of a somewhat controversial Garmin Forerunner update in March, Garmin released a new beta update, version 19.09, on Wednesday to its five latest Forerunner watches. And one bug fix can&apos;t arrive in a stable update soon enough.</p><p>The first beta update since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> launch, v19.09 helps you find a lost smartphone during an activity by saving the GPS location where your phone and Garmin watch disconnected. At that point, you can use the Find My Phone feature to track it down via Bluetooth.</p><p>You also get a new Garmin Messenger app on your watch. Up until now, you could only check Messenger on your phone, high-end Fenix models, or InReach-compatible handhelds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-gpsmap-67i-review">GPSMAP 67i</a>; with this update, you&apos;ll be able to check responses on your wrist and send quick preset replies on Android (iOS blocks this function).</p><p>While the Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t support Jet Lag Adviser, the other four Forerunners, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>, will now get a Jet Lag glance to check your progress acclimating after a long flight. It should come in handy if you&apos;re a frequent world traveler for marathons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hbLFtkXT9bBgRsnwh52Azd" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-find-my-phone.jpeg" alt="The "Find My Phone" option in the Controls menu on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hbLFtkXT9bBgRsnwh52Azd.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update includes "various UI improvements and fixes," and one in particular that stands out "fixes persistent notification vibration for incoming calls." This obnoxious bug will cause your Garmin watch to continue buzzing your wrist after you&apos;ve declined a call on your phone for about 10 seconds. We&apos;re beyond ready for this to be fixed in a stable update.</p><p>One fix exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a> is a patch for the Lock on Road feature, which essentially makes your post-run map look more accurate than it really is by dragging your GPS line onto the nearest road. All of the Forerunners received a fix to prevent music control crashes. </p><p>One noticeably absent fix, however, is anything related to the heart rate tracking issues introduced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-update-1822-adds-great-features-but-introduces-heart-rate-issues">March 18.22 update</a>. Many users complained that this patch introduced issues with the wrist-based HR sensor data. With update 19.09, Garmin added "heart rate dynamic source switching to select the best heart rate data source (watch or chest HRM) to improve accuracy during running activities."</p><p>We never heard back from Garmin about these user complaints, but this update feels like a message in itself: If you&apos;re dealing with heart rate accuracy issues, try a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-heart-rate-monitor-straps-garmin-fitbit">heart rate monitor strap</a> with wrist-based data as a backup. Hopefully, a future update will properly address these issues.</p><p>Beyond what&apos;s listed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/forerunner-965/f/announcements/366717/public-beta-version-19-09" target="_blank">Garmin Forum patch notes</a>, the Garmin Forerunner v19.09 update added haptic feedback as you scroll through menu options, something that&apos;s often found on mainstream smartwatches. If you want to test these features for yourself, you&apos;ll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=bVo5U5BV292BSr2gkZhY2A" target="_blank">sign up for the beta software</a>.</p>

<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 offers highly accurate GPS tracking with an altimeter, Training Effect and Recovery Time data, daily suggested workouts and Garmin Coach, and a bright AMOLED display instead of a dull MIP display. It lasts 11 days per charge, feels comfortably light, and costs much less than its fellow Forerunners. </p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The first Android 15 beta includes a new default wallet app option in the existing Default apps list.</li><li>Previously, alternatives to Google Wallet were permitted in the Google Play Store, and there was a Default payment app option buried in the Settings app. </li><li>Now, the new Default wallet app setting clearly covers more than just contactless payments, including digital car keys and store loyalty cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google made the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 beta</a> available to testers on April 11, following two Android 15 Developer Preview builds. There&apos;s still a lot to uncover, but one new change affects the way Android handles default payment and wallet apps.</p><p>After users update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, they&apos;ll see a fresh option in the <strong>Default apps</strong> list in settings. You can now pick a <strong>Default wallet app</strong>, which will be used for digital payments, car keys, store loyalty cards, and more.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/android-15-wallet-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotted the default wallet app choice in the Android 15 settings app after updating to the first beta. "Wallet apps can store your credit and loyalty cards, car keys, and other things to help with various forms of transactions," the setting&apos;s description explains. Most people will see two options, <strong>Google Wallet</strong> or <strong>None</strong>, but more will likely come soon. The <strong>Amex </strong>app will appear if you have it installed, and it looks like Amex is the only known third-party app to support being set as a default wallet app in Android 15.</p><p>When you choose a default wallet app, it will become the app that handles all NFC-related tasks. This includes payments and things like unlocking with digital keys or using store loyalty cards. The new setting effectively replaces the <strong>Default payment app</strong> option in prior versions of Android, which, for some reason, was <em>not</em> in the Default apps list. Instead, the outgoing default payment app selection was found under five menu pages: <strong>Settings </strong>><strong> Connected devices </strong>><strong> Connection preferences</strong> ><strong> NFC </strong>><strong> Contactless payments</strong> ><strong> Default payment app</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly enough, it may be tough to utilize this new functionality due to a potential bug affecting the first Android 15 beta. As shared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/3991?single" target="_blank">Google News Telegram</a>, the NFC settings page appears to be broken, and it is no longer showing any settings for toggling the feature on or off. This was confirmed by Android Central, which also noticed the blank NFC page in settings on two different devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.67%;"><img id="kFRARntnDZrgdqra8busED" name="Android-15-NFC.jpg" alt="A blank NFC page in the Settings app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFRARntnDZrgdqra8busED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="276" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this page being nonfunctional, Android doesn&apos;t seem to know whether NFC is enabled or disabled. This means that NFC-enabled features spanning from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> to digital keys likely won&apos;t work in the first Android 15 beta. One Android Central staff member tried to make a purchase with their Pixel after the update, and the terminal would not recognize the phone. Hopefully, no one installed this pre-release version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> on their main phone because it might be tough for some to live without contactless payments. </p><p>The problem has notably been reported on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/333935943?pli=1">Issue tracker</a>.</p><p>However, there were a handful of great features and tools added to the Android 15 beta, such as improved app archiving, better security, and new accessibility software.</p>
