                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It is difficult to stand out in the smartphone segment — particularly for a new brand — but Nothing makes it look easy. Thanks to a combination of clever marketing, a design-focused approach to products, and a lofty motto that aims to "make tech fun again," the brand was able to attract a sizeable share of attention that often exceeds more entrenched rivals.</p><p>Nothing&apos;s products have generally been well-received, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> standing out for its see-through design aesthetic, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone (1)</a> featuring a unique design at the back, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone (2)</a> building on that foundation and offering high-end hardware along with a more polished design that&apos;s among the best of any phone today.</p><p>Nothing has been around for over three years now, and for 2024, it is taking on its most ambitious challenge yet: making a budget phone that&apos;s actually fun to use. That&apos;s the premise behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone (2a)</a>, which is now on sale in select global markets. It&apos;s relatively easy to build a high-end phone like the Phone (2), but much more challenging to launch a budget phone that shares a similar ethos — that&apos;s what Nothing set out to do, and after using the device, I think the brand managed to pull it off.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the Phone (2a), I sat down with Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis to talk about the conception of the device, and why the brand is now turning its attention to the budget segment. Evangelidis will be a familiar figure if you&apos;ve followed OnePlus&apos;s journey; he was with the Chinese manufacturer for half a decade, overseeing its marketing efforts in the EU.</p><p>Evangelidis started by talking about the guiding principles at Nothing, and how design differentiation was a "low-hanging fruit" that allowed the brand to stand out from the very beginning. That&apos;s clearly the case with the Phone (2a) as well, with the phone featuring a similar see-through aesthetic at the back that shows off the innards.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-01.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s different this time is that the Phone (2a) has centered cameras, and the housing is encircled by the NFC coil. The design looks rather evocative — particularly on the white version — and Evangelidis said that a lot of thought goes into just what is highlighted at the back. "When we first design a product, we look at what components we want to bring to the surface. Everything starts from the engineering side — even our designers consider themselves to be engineers — and on the Phone (2), we chose the wireless charging coil."</p><p>As the Phone (2a) doesn&apos;t have wireless charging, Nothing made a few tweaks to the design to allow the NFC coil to be prominently showcased. It is a functional design choice, and being able to see the coil makes it a lot easier when making payments as you don&apos;t have to guess where to tap the phone against a reader.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK6vFMUq9Z7uXGN8obUste" name="Nothing-Phone-2a-AC-2.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK6vFMUq9Z7uXGN8obUste.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the positioning of the rear cameras. Evangelidis said that Nothing tried a lot of different configurations, but went with a centered design as it looks "striking." Another side effect of using a centered camera system is that the phone doesn&apos;t wobble when it&apos;s on a table. "A lot of work went into integrating the camera module, and we built a circular system with all the components — the Glyph interface, LED flash, positioning of the various screws — within a specific radius to create symmetry."</p><p>Nothing used a polycarbonate back to save weight (and manufacturing costs), and Evangelidis noted that it allowed the brand to come up with a unibody design that flows around the camera module and extends to the sides, with subtle curves where the back meets the mid-frame. The phone still uses an aluminum mid-frame — giving it structural rigidity — and Nothing&apos;s decision to use recycled materials is also an outlier in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other differentiating design feature at the back is the battery cable. "The team took inspiration from Massimo Vignelli&apos;s NYC subway maps, and the idea was to turn something complex into a design that was visually simple and aesthetically elegant. We&apos;ve had a similar curve on all our products, but the Phone (2a) is the first product that really showcases it fully."</p><p>Evangelidis said that the final design of the (2a) is close to the very first concept the brand envisaged back in 2020, but they couldn&apos;t execute the design at that point. That&apos;s a good segue into Nothing&apos;s capabilities; the brand now has dedicated hardware and software teams, but that wasn&apos;t the case back when the Phone (1) launched. As such, that device had a vanilla interface that didn&apos;t wasn&apos;t cohesive with the bold design, but Nothing remedied that in 2021 with the launch of its own interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-red-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) with the stock glass red wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> team includes a lot of staffers who previously worked on OxygenOS, and like legacy versions of that interface, the goal here is to deliver a "fast and smooth" experience that&apos;s intuitive at the same time. Nothing OS 2.5 is visually striking thanks to the liberal use of bold colors, and there&apos;s a clever widget system, a monochrome mode that&apos;s just plain cool, and meaningful customizability.</p><p>One area where the Phone (2a) stands out from other Nothing phones is the use of MediaTek hardware instead of Qualcomm. Evangelidis noted it was an "obvious decision" to use the Dimensity 7200 Pro, even though it required more work to integrate the hardware and optimize the platform.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As to why Nothing is focusing on the budget segment, Evangelidis said it all came down to timing. "We started Nothing to do something different in the industry; the ear (1) was purely about hardware design differentiation, and it sold half a million units. That allowed us to raise money to get into the phone segment, and for the first two years, we built products while simultaneously setting up our teams, and it was hectic."</p><p>"Phone (2) was a turning point as we had the hardware and software teams in place, along with the hundreds of vendors that handle manufacturing of all the various parts. We wanted to enter the premium segment to prove that we could deliver at that level, and we managed to do that."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BEyLKWF9UBoNqRJJfmskzK" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-blue-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) with the stock glass blue wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BEyLKWF9UBoNqRJJfmskzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Phone (2) certainly delivered in a lot of areas, the phone was significantly costlier than its predecessor, and that made it less accessible to a swathe of Nothing&apos;s userbase. "The price gap (between Phone (1) and (2)) was a bit too much for some of our users, and we&apos;ve seen with the Phone (2) that there is a sizeable fanbase that is engaged with the brand and wants to use our products, so we wanted to create a product that lives up to the Nothing expectations while being much more accessible. We wanted to create a phone we would use ourselves."</p><p>Evangelidis touched upon the state of budget phones, noting how a few brands were chasing meaningless hardware goals without thinking of the end user. So with the Phone (2a), the brand went with two 50MP cameras at the back instead of adding a lot of auxiliary sensors, a flexible AMOLED screen with thin bezels on all sides, and a 5000mAh battery — its largest yet — with 45W charging.</p><p>But it&apos;s the software where things are noticeably different. "We offer three years of platform updates on our flagship, so it was obvious for us to roll out the same guarantee with the Phone (2a). We didn&apos;t want to compromise on our core values, and aimed to deliver the same great user experience in this segment."</p><p>Nothing is all about scaling its efforts in 2024. It has the requisite teams in place, and Evangelidis said the brand is "kicking into high gear" with its product portfolio. The Phone (2a) is off to a strong start as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phones</a>, netting 60,000 sales on launch day in India, well ahead of what the Phone (1) and (2) managed cumulatively. It will be interesting to see how Nothing builds on the early momentum, but it&apos;s clear that the brand absolutely nailed the timing. </p><p>On the subject of timing, Evangelidis said the brand isn&apos;t quite ready to make a full-fledged debut in the U.S., so it isn&apos;t making the Phone (2a) available in general sale at this moment. But in the markets where the phone is officially launching, it has the potential to shake things up — and that&apos;s no small feat for a brand that&apos;s just three years old. </p>

<p>Every day brings us new Qi2-equipped accessories from the best brands in the industry. Although we don&apos;t have Android phones that come with this spec just yet, there&apos;s a huge pro to this trend.</p><p>You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find a wireless charging power bank with MagSafe that supports fast wireless charging speeds for Android devices. This makes sense because even now, we don&apos;t actually have Android phones with magnetic wireless charging built-in.</p><p>However, magnetic rings and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories for Android</a> have completely changed the game. We Android users can get so creative with our accessories, all thanks to a MagSafe adapter for the platform.</p><p>Anker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/esr-qi2-car-charger">joined brands like ESR</a> and iOttie in its pursuit of Qi2. The Chinese accessory maker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/anker-innovations-unveils-series-of-stylish-powerful-products-from-its-portfolio-of-technology-and-lifestyle-brands-at-ifa-2023-301914566.html" rel="nofollow">unveiled a slew of Qi2 accessories</a> in August 2023, and they are now widely available for purchase. Of all the newly released charging gear, the refreshed Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) is my favorite.</p>

<p>Anker applied its famous out-of-the-box thinking to the case, resulting in a three-in-one charging solution of sorts. The Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) is a 6,600mAh power bank with 15W Qi2 wireless charging support. You get this speed on both Android and iOS devices alike.</p><p>Like any Anker product, the MagGo Power Bank is built really well. You feel confident in its construction as soon as you feel it in your hands.</p>

<p>The magnetic force is impressively strong, latching onto both iPhones with MagSafe as well as devices that use magnetic rings with equal magnetic strength. Apart from 15W wireless charging, you also get a USB-C port that pushes out 18W and takes in 20W of power.</p><p>Since it is a power bank, you don&apos;t need to keep it plugged in to enjoy wireless or wired charging with the Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K). However, should you want to top up your battery pack and charge your phone wirelessly at the same time, that option is also available to you.</p>

<p>You won&apos;t need any other power bank after you invest in the Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K). The coolest thing about this portable charging solution is that it can fold and unfold, converting into a kickstand in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This means that you don&apos;t even need to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charging stand</a> separately. Just unfold the MagGo Power Bank at an angled position so it holds up your phone in portrait or landscape orientation. Pop the thing in your bag if you want the same convenience while traveling. Plus, this also eliminates the need to pack a kickstand or phone holder separately.</p>

<p>The Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) can bend at angles from 30° to 65°, which is ideal for watching YouTube videos, TikToks, or just browsing through your favorite social media apps and blogs. Don&apos;t worry about overheating because Anker embedded a clever cooling system into its creation, keeping your portable power bank cool as a cucumber.</p><p>And since this power bank has a 6,600mAh capacity, it is flight-friendly too. You can take the MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) with you on all international flights worry-free. How handy is it to have a wireless charger that doubles as a kickstand on a plane?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't see myself getting on a flight without this.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you feel like 6,600mAh isn&apos;t enough, just remember that it&apos;s more than enough to recharge your average Android phone with a 4,000mAh to 4,500mAh cell about one and a half times. What more could you ask for on the go?</p><p>The Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) is a three-in-one accessory, acting as a kickstand, power bank, and wireless charger all at once. It&apos;s not that big or heavy either, and you get to choose from a variety of signature Anker colors like green, blue, and purple, in addition to white and black.</p><p>With a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">Type-C cable</a> in the box, Anker&apos;s reliable two-year warranty, and Wireless PowerIQ, the $70 price tag is well worth the splurge. I don&apos;t see myself getting on a flight without this by my side anytime soon.</p>

Starting at $349/£319/€329/₹23,999, this phone is available in several countries in the EMEA region of the world and attempts to help spread the word of Nothing&apos;s unique design, including a "glyph interface" of special LED lights on the back.</p><p>A week ago, we asked you what you thought about the phone and if you had any lingering questions after our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Nothing Phone (2a) hands-on</a> went live. Turns out, our readers are plenty curious about what could possibly be the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phone</a> of 2024.</p><p>We&apos;ve collected all the questions you asked on our social media channels and compiled them here for easy reference. Here&apos;s everything you wanted to know about the Nothing Phone (2a)!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-and-release-date-2">What are the specs and release date?</h2>
<p>The Nothing Phone (2a) is publicly available from March 12 "in most global markets," according to Nothing. The phone&apos;s price starts at $349/£319/€329/₹23,999, but U.S. customers will have to sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/pages/glyph-developer-kit">the developer program</a> in order to buy one.</p><p>As for specs, the processor and plastic build make this one decidedly mid-range. Still, the camera, display, and IP54 water and dust-resistance rating elevate it over some similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">midrange Android phones</a>. Here&apos;s the full spec sheet.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-work-on-t-mobile-2">Does it work on T-Mobile?</h2>
<p>Juan Carlos on Facebook was wondering if this would be a good choice on T-Mobile.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using the phone on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G network (with 5G connectivity) in the U.S. for over a week and haven&apos;t noticed any coverage issues, so this one is good to go if you&apos;re interested.</p>
<h2 id="how-large-is-the-system-file-size-2">How large is the system file size?</h2>
<p>Thanks to Rahul on Facebook for this question!</p><p>The system partition size on the Nothing Phone (2a) sits at 18GB. Nothing Phone (2a) comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box.</p><p>After installing all of my usual apps and using the phone for a week, I still have 206GB free. This measurement is entirely subjective, but I thought it was plenty of storage for my personal needs.</p>
<h2 id="how-apos-s-the-performance-of-the-dimensity-7200-pro-2">How&apos;s the performance of the Dimensity 7200 Pro?</h2>
<p>Several readers were concerned about the performance of the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro processor inside, especially compared to Snapdragon processors. Since Nothing thought it made sense to compare it to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a> and list it as an upgrade, I&apos;ll use that for comparison.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 1 shipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G processor, which put it in an upper mid-range performance profile at launch. Meanwhile, the Nothing Phone 2a uses a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. While Nothing claimed the Phone 2a performed better than the Phone 1, this is only partially true.</p><p>Geekbench 6.2.2 scores help show that the Nothing Phone 2a has a weaker CPU but a stronger GPU than the Nothing Phone 1. Gaming, therefore, is commonly better on Phone 2a, but everyday tasks are smoother on Phone 1.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.57%;"><img id="tGVyCQSsNMrQG6cptwz8Nf" name="nothing-phone-2a-benchmarks-geekbench-cpu.jpg" alt="Comparing the Nothing Phone (2a) with the Nothing Phone (1) and Google Pixel 7a in benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGVyCQSsNMrQG6cptwz8Nf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="626" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.57%;"><img id="vJR95Nzx5x9pcwenY6BxVf" name="nothing-phone-2a-benchmarks-geekbench-gpu.jpg" alt="Comparing the Nothing Phone (2a) with the Nothing Phone (1) and Google Pixel 7a in benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJR95Nzx5x9pcwenY6BxVf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="626" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Case in point, I noticed the 2a would occasionally stutter when opening menus or navigating through apps or pages for the initial load. Most of the time the phone was plenty smooth and I didn&apos;t encounter any performance issues, but the occasional stutter reminded me that this was a mid-range chip.</p><p>Gaming performance is similarly worse, although not remarkably so when playing most games. More graphic-intense games will, however, reveal the performance gap between the Snapdragon 778G and Dimensity 7200 Pro.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-phone-throttle-performance-2">Does the phone throttle performance?</h2>
<p>Manav had several questions for us, but he wasn&apos;t alone </p><p>All phones have to throttle performance over time unless you buy one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">best gaming phones</a> with active cooling. That said, all other phones see a drop in performance when running processing-intensive tasks like gaming.</p><p>Using the Burnout Benchmark on the Google Play Store, the Nothing Phone 2a fared quite a bit better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> during the test, but the Nothing Phone 1 did a much better job than both phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.92%;"><img id="zy8uRxm2Qzktq4QgQaqahf" name="nothing-phone-2a-benchmarks-geekbench-burnout-bench.jpg" alt="Comparing the Nothing Phone (2a) with the Nothing Phone (1) and Google Pixel 7a in benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zy8uRxm2Qzktq4QgQaqahf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the scores show, the Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s Dimensity 7200 Pro is the most power-efficient chipset, meaning the phone will deliver better battery life for heavy users. However, the ratio of performance-per-watt to throttled performance was in the Nothing Phone 1&apos;s favor.</p><p>The Pixel 7a scored the best compute score but only just slightly higher than the Nothing Phone 1. As you&apos;ll notice from the grey graph in the screenshots above, the Pixel 7a not only throttled the hardest, but it also throttled quickest of the three phones tested.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-an-upgrade-over-a-pixel-6a-2">Is this an upgrade over a Pixel 6a?</h2>
<p>The Tensor G1 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a> is roughly 30% faster than the Dimensity 7200 Pro inside the Nothing Phone 2a, but as you can see above, that only matters for a short period of time.</p><p>Of course, CPU performance isn&apos;t the only metric of the definition of an upgrade, but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily consider the Nothing Phone 2a an upgrade over the Pixel depending on your needs.</p><p>The display is certainly a lot better than the Pixel 6a&apos;s, as it gets much brighter — 1300 nits vs 800 nits — and is far more eye-friendly. It uses DC dimming at higher brightness levels and 2,140Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> below 50%. The Pixel 6a uses 240hz PWM at all brightness levels, which I personally find very uncomfortable.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s display also has double the refresh rate of the Pixel 6a, making the phone feel a lot smoother even though the processor isn&apos;t as fast. I also noticed that Wi-Fi performance and network signal were stronger on the Nothing Phone 2a versus the Pixel 6a or 7a.</p><p>You&apos;ll get better battery life from the Nothing Phone 2a, and it charges a lot faster — 18W on the Pixel 6a vs 45W on the Nothing Phone 2a. Neither phone supports wireless charging.</p><p>But the Pixel camera will beat the Nothing Phone 2a camera any time of day. The Nothing Phone 2a camera system isn&apos;t bad at all, but there&apos;s no comparison to the Pixel camera in this price segment.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-bootloader-unlocked-2">Is the bootloader unlocked?</h2>
<p>No. The Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s bootloader is locked.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-plastic-back-scratch-easily-2">Does the plastic back scratch easily?</h2>
<p>Abhinav on X was concerned about the plastic back, particularly if it scratches easily.</p><p>After using it for a week, I haven&apos;t found any blemishes on the phone at all. That being said, I was able to easily scratch the corner of the back with a key after I read your question.</p><p>Scratches on this phone will likely be less obvious than other plastic phones since this one uses a transparent back plate. If you&apos;re worried about it, you can purchase an official case at checkout on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.tech">nothing.tech</a> website. Nothing also offers its own insurance plans that cover damage, also available for purchase at checkout on the website.</p><p>For me, the most annoying thing about the plastic back is that it&apos;s a massive dust magnet. I feel compelled to wipe the phone off every time I take it out of my pocket, and that&apos;s quite annoying. On the bright side, plastic makes it a very light phone.</p>
<h2 id="how-good-is-the-camera-2">How good is the camera?</h2>
<p>Manav astutely wondered if the camera was worth using, and my general answer is that it is. The camera regularly surprised me, and I found that it was a better performer than the Phone 2. It also traded blows with the Pixel 7a in some tests, but I&apos;d say the Pixel 7a has a better overall camera system.</p><p>This one sports a main 50MP sensor plus a 50MP ultrawide sensor on the back, so it&apos;s a fairly versatile camera. You can zoom to 2x without losing detail, but quality degrades beyond that.</p>

<p>The photos above compare the Nothing Phone 2a, Nothing Phone 2, and Google Pixel 7a. The Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s main camera does a better job in low lighting than the Nothing Phone 2 and trades blows with the Pixel 7a in the same conditions.</p><p>The ultrawide camera is a little softer than the Pixel 7a. Likewise, the front-facing camera seems to be a tiny bit softer than the Nothing Phone 2. Otherwise, this is an admirable camera and very impressive for a $350 phone.</p>

<ul><li>Despite the existence of competing options, like Samsung's DeX, Google Pixel phones have been lacking in display output support.</li><li>Not only does the Pixel Launcher lack a desktop environment available to end users, Pixel phones have been without DisplayPort Alternate Mode support.</li><li>With the release of Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2, Google is enabling DP Alt Mode and allowing users to connect their Pixel to external displays.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Pixel users got excited when it was revealed that Google was supporting DisplayPort Alternate Mode at a hardware level on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series. However, Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro owners were quickly disappointed to find out that Google was still blocking external display connections over USB-C with software. Now, months after the Pixel 8 series debuted, it looks like Google has changed its mind and plans to support display mirroring over a cable.</p><p>As Mishaal Rahman revealed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-display-output-3424412/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google has added software support for DP Alt Mode with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2</a>. When you connect a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro to an external monitor, a "mirror display" option will appear. If you tap to enable it, your Android operating system will be shown on the connected monitor or TV. Notably, unless you manually enable desktop mode in developer options, you&apos;ll be stuck with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>&apos;s regular view.</p><p>Even then, Rahman notes that the Android desktop mode that can be enabled in developer options is the older, built-in version that has been around since Android 10. An overhauled version is supposedly on the way, but it requires multiple Android flags to be enabled before it can be accessed. Rahman suggests that Google could be gearing up to launch a DeX competitor with the Pixel 9 series, but nothing is confirmed at this point.  </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally: Google has enabled display output on a Pixel phone for the first time!With Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2, you can mirror your Pixel 8's screen to an external display, as Google has finally enabled DisplayPort Alternate Mode.More details below👇https://t.co/ah13vOX9ob<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1767229031466803438">March 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>For those that are unfamiliar, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a> ports that support DP Alt Mode can natively support display output via capable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> or adapters. Pixel phones have had USB-C ports with DP Alt Mode before, but Google only enabled DP Alt Mode at the hardware level this year. Until now, no software support for DP Alt Mode was available on the Pixel 8 series. That meant if you tried to connect a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro to a monitor, nothing would happen.</p><p>A few workarounds were available, such as using Google Cast for wireless mirroring or buying a DisplayLink adapter. DP Alt Mode could be enabled with root access as well. However, this meant Pixels were more limited in display output options than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and even iPhones.</p><p>The addition of native display output support in Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 could mean that it fully debuts this summer with the release of the public update. Or, it&apos;s possible that Google could walk back the change before a stable release arrives. It does seem to indicate that Google is working on better display output support, though, which is good news for Pixel owners.</p>

Despite charging ever-increasing prices, many of these platforms still let users deal with their clunky interfaces. So why are streaming platforms forcing customers to pay more while offering an average user experience?</p><p>Platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Max, etc., have replaced traditional cable subscriptions as a go-to source of entertainment. According to a recent study, Americans spend 20 hours a week on these platforms and pay an average of $46 per month for these services. The reason is the wide variety of content that is constantly refreshed on the platform weekly, sometimes even daily. However, in their pursuit of content acquisition, these streaming giants seem to be neglecting one crucial point—user experience.</p><p>According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/internet/streaming-stats/#:~:text=Netflix%20is%20the%20streaming%20platform,of%20interface%20and%20user%20experience"><u>survey</u></a> conducted by Forbes Home, Amazon Prime Video has the second-highest number of subscribers in 2024 (200 million). However, only 14 percent of the respondents felt it was easy to navigate through its UI.</p>

<p>For many users, fast-forwarding and rewinding or navigating Prime Video’s clunky UI can be bothersome. The interface sort of lags when you try to scrub within the video, making it difficult for users to gauge where they actually left off. </p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/vg4qts/does_prime_video_interface_sucks_for_you_too/"><u>Reddit</u></a> thread showcases the problems users face today on Amazon Prime Video. One user even goes so far as to say that the platform has the worst user interface. </p><p>“Some of the original Amazon content is worth watching, but that’s all they have going for them. It’s truly hilarious that Amazon is one of the biggest corporations in the world. They spent $1 Billion on their ‘Lord of the Rings’ TV show, and yet they can’t even get something as basic as a functional user interface right,” a user added.</p><p>Another user comments that “much like Amazon’s product search nowadays, their Prime Video search is hot garbage. And now they’re adding ads; they might as well just give up altogether now.”</p><p>Richard Lachman, the director of digital media in the RTA School of Media at Toronto Metropolitan University, says people often don’t find features in common when switching platforms, which can lead to a frustrating experience. “Some features aren’t easily available, some are buggy, and some aren’t available on all platforms,” he added.</p><p>Amazon Prime isn’t the only platform that has been criticized for its UI. Hulu and Max (formerly HBO Max) also had users complaining about navigation inconsistency and overall glitchy UI.</p><p>Mia Eltiste, a user experience (UX) researcher based in Austin, Texas, reviews streaming platforms and their interfaces on TikTok. In one of her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@heymiadotco/video/7170909341208284458?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1"><u>videos</u></a>, she points out that Hulu’s navigation bar keeps disappearing when returning to the home screen. “Do not put your navigation on the top bar; put it on the side,” Eltiste states.</p>

<p>As users scroll down vertically, the bar keeps disappearing, but when it’s on the side, it’s easier to access. She adds that the platform should ensure the navigation bar is available on all pages—not just the home screen.</p><p>Moreover, while everyone feels that Netflix has nailed its UI, many feel the search bar still needs work, and watching the end credits of a series or movie seems impossible because the UI jumps to the next episode or movie you can watch. Android Central’s Jerry Hildenbrand agrees with the sentiment and says that he finds it frustrating to search for things to watch. </p><p>“Netflix looks nice and is easy to use, but it doesn’t show me enough content. Nobody wants to use the search from their phone, so it’s important to show me what ya got.”</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1922px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="yYEUxUtZmYKVqzg52Hii7Q" name="Amazon-Prime-video-continue-watching.jpg" alt="Prime Video continue watching" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yYEUxUtZmYKVqzg52Hii7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1922" height="1082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lachman says the business strategy for several of these platforms isn’t focused on user experience as a differentiator but on content acquisition. It gets to the point where some services are rushed to launch, “spending the bulk of their budget on content without mature tech/UX teams and a priority on understanding and responding to user experiences.”</p><p>He feels that user complaints about UX are not a reason people choose to unsubscribe to streaming services, but this is set to change as users start taking UI into consideration when deciding to leave or subscribe to a service. “If there are fewer players, all with high-quality content, then the UX teams may gain some priority in decision-making and budgets.”</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced-television.com/2024/01/23/forecast-content-spend-to-grow-2-in-2024/#:~:text=Global%20streaming%20services%20remain%20crucial%20for%20spend%20growth&text=With%20a%20continued%20focus%20on,in%202024%20to%20%2446%20billion."><u>Ampere Analysis</u></a>, global streaming services are set to increase their total content spending by 7 percent in 2024 to $46 billion. Netflix will spend $17 billion this year acquiring content, while Amazon’s total video and music expense in 2023 was $18.9 billion.</p><p>Back in 2022, Amazon Prime Video <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-2022-redesign"><u>redesigned</u></a> its home page, giving it a modern facelift. The current UI features a simplified navigation menu, a new Live TV page, and redesigned carousels for better content discovery. However, this redesign focused on highlighting their broad selection of content and not on the basics of how the app functions.</p>

<p>According to Eltiste, any platform that wants to improve its user experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@heymiadotco/video/7341134829016075562?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1"><u>should focus</u></a> on being functional, reliable, and usable. Still, many companies don’t even think about it being a pleasurable experience on their platform.</p><p>Lachman says that a better way to approach UI is to focus on usage and content consumption. Companies should also pay attention to user frustrations and track social media complaints about the UX and product features. </p><p>In 2023, Max made some changes to its user experience amid the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/hbo-max-discovery-plus-streaming-service">merger between HBO Max and Discovery Plus</a> into one platform. Following complaints about its glitchy interface, TechCrunch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/warner-bros-discovery-promises-max-will-be-a-more-personalized-technically-improved-streaming-service/"><u>reported</u></a> that Max was set to gain an updated user interface with various improvements to deliver a seamless transition for existing HBO Max subscribers across most platforms.</p><p>Lachman notes that companies need to prioritize UX in budget, hiring, and strategy. “Make sure user experience champions are the key members of decision-making and empower them to dedicate resources to improving the interface.”</p><p>As the streaming landscape constantly changes, focusing solely on content acquisition might not be enough to attract or retain subscribers. Platforms also need to prioritize user feedback, which could help them retain their subscribers in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Contacts has undergone a makeover, introducing a 'Connected apps' section to enhance the contact details page.</li><li>The revamped contact details page now presents information about contacts linked to other apps on your phone in a more organized manner.</li><li>The update is seemingly reaching all users, but individual experiences may vary as it could be a server-side tweak.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Contacts just got a makeover, spiffing up the contact details page with a new <em>Connected apps</em> section.</p><p>When you search for a particular contact linked to another app on your phone, the contact details will now display the information in a more organized manner. This tweak was first uncovered by AssembleDebug in the app&apos;s 4.26 version (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/google-contacts-simplifies-showing.html" target="_blank">TheSpandroid</a>).</p><p>Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-google-contacts-tips-tricks">Google Contacts</a> not only displays details from your locally stored contacts but also gathers information from other apps on your phone. However, the interface can be a bit overwhelming, flooding the contact&apos;s details page with a jumble of phone numbers.</p><p>Thanks to the fresh <em>Connected apps</em> section, users can now access and handle all the connected app information in one handy spot, with the option to expand for more details. The new top-level menu neatly displays each service you and a specific contact are connected on, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, Viber, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-telegram-premium">Telegram</a>.</p><p>This feature also extends to any of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">go-to messaging apps</a>, where you and your contacts often communicate, be it in the form of messages or voice and video calls.</p><p>While the new setup might seem neater, there&apos;s a downside. Now, to reach someone on a messaging service, you have to tap the service first and then select an option. Previously, a single tap could get you into conversations or phone calls.</p><p>However, with the new section, the display of contact information gets streamlined, resulting in better organization, as evident in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>Get ready for some YouTube-style long-form videos on your smart TV, courtesy of X (formerly Twitter). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/08/elon-musk-x-smart-tv-app-youtube-clone-amazon-samsung-pivot-video/" target="_blank">Fortune</a> reports that the service is cooking up a TV app specifically designed for smart TVs.</p><p>Elon Musk spilled the beans on this upcoming feature in a post on the platform in response to an X post discussing the possibility of watching lengthy videos on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">smart TVs</a> soon.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming soon https://t.co/JlnlSL7eS9<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1766304130690056322">March 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The app might bear a resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> app, as reported by Fortune. An unnamed source mentioned Musk&apos;s determination to take on YouTube and that the app might arrive as early as this week.</p><p>Initially, X&apos;s upcoming video app is set to make its debut exclusively on Amazon and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tvs">Samsung smart TVs</a>, as per the report.</p><p>This move is seen as a piece of the billionaire&apos;s grand plan to turn X into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-twitter-money-transmitter-payment-features-progress">ultimate "everything app."</a> X already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-twitter-voice-video-call-android-rollout">has your back with video and audio calls</a>, even for free users.</p><p>For $8 a month, premium users also score some sweet perks, including the coveted verified badge, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-new-plans-basic-premium-plus">edit button</a>, longer posts, and more.</p><p>The report comes a few months after X announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/transforming-the-global-town-square" target="_blank">blog post</a> a shift from its text-based origins, proudly stating that it&apos;s now a "video-first platform." Users can now upload long-form videos to the platform, the company noted.</p><p>As part of Musk&apos;s push to amp up longer-form content on the platform, he roped in the popular YouTuber MrBeast to drop a video on X. According to the content creator, the single upload raked in $250,000 in revenue.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TikTok is rumored to be gearing up for competition with Instagram by developing a new app called "TikTok Photos."</li><li>The speculated TikTok Photos app could allow existing TikTok users to import or sync their publicly shared photos from TikTok to the new app.</li><li>TikTok Photos is reportedly in development for both Android and iOS, with an expected launch "soon."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TikTok might be preparing to challenge Instagram with a new app in the works called "TikTok Photos."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Tiktok-Photo-Sharing-Platform.html" target="_blank">TheSpAndroid&apos;s AssembleDebug</a> stumbled upon code in the latest TikTok app update, suggesting the imminent release of a photo-sharing feature akin to Instagram (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/tiktok-photos-3424441/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Numerous mentions of "TikTok Photos" were uncovered in version 33.8.4 (com.zhiliaoapp.musically) of the TikTok app.</p><p>Phrases like "Open TikTok Photos," "Share this post to TikTok Photos," and "Reach other like-minded people who enjoy photo posts" were found in a few code strings, hinting at the features and functionality of the upcoming photo-sharing service.</p><p>The rumored app is expected to allow current TikTok users to kick off their TikTok Photos journey by importing or syncing the photos they&apos;ve already shared publicly on TikTok.</p><p>The leaker also posted images that could be the logo for the TikTok Photos app. The logo seems to be a red "P" and maintains the same color scheme as the original TikTok app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.06%;"><img id="SoraadCpRBoMXTBMXx9nbW" name="tiktok-photos-logo.jpg" alt="TIkTok Photos app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SoraadCpRBoMXTBMXx9nbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="519" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / TheSpAndroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The post mentions that TikTok Photos is in development for both Android and iOS, and is expected to launch "soon."</p><p>If a dedicated TikTok Photos app is indeed in development, it could be poised for competition with Instagram. The irony lies in the fact that Instagram introduced its short-form vertical video feature, Reels, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-takes-aim-at-tiktok-with-these-new-reels-features">in response to TikTok&apos;s popularity worldwide</a>.</p><p>TikTok has established its widely popular social media platform by focusing on short-form videos, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-shorts-pilot">trend that has since spread to YouTube</a> and other popular apps.</p><p>Although TikTok currently lets users share multiple photos through slideshow videos, it seems the company is gearing up to provide a more dedicated photo-sharing experience with the potential app.</p><p>The introduction of a standalone TikTok Photos app isn&apos;t entirely unexpected, especially considering TikTok has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/editing-tools" target="_blank">incorporated a "photo mode" for still images</a> within the main platform.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that a TikTok-branded photo app could open up more opportunities in Western markets. It might be a strategic move, especially considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">potential threat of TikTok facing another ban</a> in the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Messages is introducing custom color options for RCS chats in a phased rollout to selected beta users.</li><li>Custom bubbles are specific to RCS chats and do not apply to SMS threads.</li><li>The theme selected affects various on-screen elements, excluding the text field and the voice recorder button.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages is rolling out the ability to set custom colors for RCS chats for a few beta users.</p><p>Back in November, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-profile-discovery-and-new-customization">introduced color options for chat bubbles</a>, letting users personalize their chat colors. Now, it seems like the update is gradually rolling out to beta testers. This change is visible in versions 20240228 to 20240308 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-custom-rcs-colors-starting-to-roll-out-b/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>.</p><p>However, there&apos;s also a server-side component in play. It&apos;s important to note that custom bubbles are exclusive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">RCS chats</a> and won&apos;t show up in SMS threads.</p><p>To explore the fresh color choices, just tap the three-dot menu button in any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> thread and pick "Change colors" from the overflow menu.</p><p>If you prefer another route, head to the overflow menu, tap on <em>Details </em>or <em>Group details</em>, and look for the "Change colors" option just below the images and videos section. A full-screen preview UI will pop up, offering nine choices that include a default color, blue, purple, green, orange, and pink, among other options.</p>

<p>The default theme uses <em>Material You</em> dynamic theming, subtly picking accent colors from your device wallpaper. Meanwhile, the other eight options go for more vibrant colors.</p><p>The theme you pick affects almost everything on the screen, from your message bubble to various elements.</p><p>Once you choose a new color for a thread, a message pops up at the bottom of the screen saying "You changed the theme." You&apos;ll also see a <em>Change </em>link next to it that takes you straight to the settings page, making it easy to switch back or choose another theme.</p><p>According to Android Police, if you change your chat colors in Messages but your friend doesn&apos;t have the update yet, their phone won&apos;t show the fancy colors. But it&apos;s safe to assume that the update will reach them soon too.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is taking away a beloved trick that allows you to play YouTube videos in the background without paying for a premium subscription.</p><p>Xiaomi announced on its Mi Fans <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/Mi_Global_Community/6769" target="_blank">Telegram channel</a> that it is ditching a feature that used to let devices with MIUI and HyperOS play YouTube audio with the screen off, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-removes-youtube-background-play-3424315/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>This change isn&apos;t sparing any Xiaomi devices running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/xiaomi-hyperos-global-rollout-announcement">HyperOS</a>, MIUI 14, MIUI 13, or MIUI 12. This means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, 13, 13 Pro, and 12T, among others, are affected by the move.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.50%;"><img id="NPFQ67EEzHc493ccTKpM3J" name="xiaomi-telegram.jpg" alt="List of Xiaomi phones where the ability to play YouTube in the background is being removed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPFQ67EEzHc493ccTKpM3J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi mentioned "compliance requirements" as the reason behind the feature removal. The Chinese phone maker refused to disclose additional details, but it&apos;s possible that Google had a hand in asking Xiaomi to ditch the feature.</p><p>We have reached out to Xiaomi for a statement, but the company was not immediately available to comment. We will update this article once we receive a response.</p><p>Since the beginning, one of the major perks of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> has been the ability to play videos in the background even when the screen is off. If you&apos;re not shelling out $14 a month, the regular app doesn&apos;t let you enjoy this capability.</p><p>However, if you had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">Xiaomi phone</a>, you could pull off this trick without splurging on YouTube Premium. The Chinese tech giant had a built-in way on its smartphones to let you listen to YouTube in the background.</p><p>The company named it "Play video sound with screen off" in the video toolbox. In the game toolbox feature, it goes by the name "Turn off screen," and it made its debut with MIUI 12.</p><p>Then again, YouTube Premium is a cash cow for the search giant, and Xiaomi providing a workaround for a paid perk probably didn&apos;t go down well with Google.</p><p>Now that the Chinese tech giant has yanked this highly popular feature, users keen on playing YouTube in the background will need to bite the bullet and shell out for YouTube Premium.</p>
