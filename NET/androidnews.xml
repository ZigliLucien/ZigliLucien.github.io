<ul><li>The July Google Play System update brings new features to several Android services.</li><li>With the latest updates, Android TV and Android WebView have improved security, privacy, and bug fixes.</li><li>Cross devices also gain improvements like the ability to join your phone's hotspot with your Google account-connected devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The July Google System updates have brought some significant new features to several Android devices, including the latest Play services, which were rolled out to devices early this month. However, as the search giant keeps updating over the month, here are some new changes in the recent Google System Release notes.</p><p>With the latest system update, Google has brought new security and privacy enhancements, including logging improvements to Android TV Core services with version 6.8.2. This has also been carried out on Android WebView. Bearing the v127 version, it added new developer features for Google and other third-party app developers. </p><p>They have the support functionality to showcase web content in their apps. However, as Google noted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">changelog</a>, some features are experimental and only available to certain users.</p>
<p>Google Play Services and the Google Play Store also saw some enhancements last week. The former, with a version of v24.28, comprised cross-device services, where users are allowed to connect to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>&apos;s hotspot from their tablet or any other Google account-connected device—eliminating the need to set them up again manually. As for the Play Store (v41.9), users can see more updates about the game directly from the developer for select game titles.</p><p>While these were the latest additions to Google System updates added last week, previous updates from early this month included bug fixes in account management-related services for Google Play services. </p><p>On the other hand, Play Store has allowed users to choose apps they like to improve their recommendations further. Regarding device connectivity, Google Play services have also added new developer features. Another security feature of Find My Device is that users can unlock their devices remotely with their respective phone numbers.</p><p>Additionally, users can control Google Play Services straight from the settings on their smartphone. Finally, as part of the Google Play Store upgrade made available earlier this month, users can submit their new apps for a thorough threat analysis through Google Play Protect.</p>

They hit all the right notes (pun intended) while offering tech that is competitive with other products at this price point. This year’s Galaxy Buds iteration features a complete redesign reminiscent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-airpods-android-device">Apple’s AirPods Pro, with a stem</a>, although I think what they offer overshadows the brouhaha over the Apple-inspired redesign. Let’s talk about that!</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-price-and-availability"><span>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-unboxing.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with everything that comes in the box shown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Available for preorder now in white or silver, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro delivery date has been pushed back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-delays-galaxy-buds-3-pro-shipments">due to some quality control issues</a>. Going to their site right now and trying to preorder, the page shows I can pick up a pair in one of my local Samsung stores on August 13th for $249.99. Having it shipped currently shows that the buds won&apos;t get to me until August 28th. We&apos;ll keep you posted as these QC issues shake out. </p><p>This price places them $50 below some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">top-performing ANC earbuds</a>, like Sony’s venerable WF-1000XM5 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra earbuds. However, the price is in line with other smartphone manufacturers, like Apple and their AirPods Pro.</p>

<p>Let’s deal with the white elephant in the room: AirPods. Previous generations of stemless Galaxy Buds fit in my ears just fine. AirPods and AirPods Pro, on the other hand, never have unless I added Comply foam ear tips to keep them from falling out. So when I found out I would be reviewing the newly redesigned Buds 3 Pro, I was less than enthusiastic. </p><p>From a microphone perspective, stems make sense, but even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC</a> doesn’t stay in my ears without Comply foam ear tips. However, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <em>do</em> stay in my ears just fine. In fact, they are <em>quite</em> comfortable, although when I get sweaty, their silicone ear tips dislodge a bit, diminishing the ANC. </p><p>Eventually, I’ll add Comply foam ear tips to make their fit more secure during exercise.</p>

<p>I have the Silver model for review. The case is small and easily pocketable, and I really like the look of the entire unit. I like the color-matched left and right, blue and orange pops of color. As a lover of swords, I find the blade-style stems quite cool in how they look and light up. For me, those lights are giving Tron, and I’m here for it.</p><p>Beyond the sound — we’ll get to that in a second — my favorite aspect of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is the Samsung ecosystem connectivity. For my review, I used them connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. The ability to control the most important features directly from the GW7 is wonderful. Getting notifications read in my ear from the S22 Ultra and being able to take advantage of the SSC codec makes the Buds 3 Pro experience a joy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AhpLGPvCGRdbQJMxFpqqcS" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-stem-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhpLGPvCGRdbQJMxFpqqcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The stem-based controls are easy to learn and responsive when in use. Pinching or holding the lower end of the stems switches noise controls by default, but they can be customized for the left and right sides. This includes the ability to deactivate pinch controls altogether.</p><p>The single/double/triple pinch media controls, which play/pause music or move forward/back a track, aren’t customizable but can also be deactivated. The ability to slide your finger along the stem to control volume is quite responsive without being easy to accidentally activate when you’re pinching and holding. I never had that happen during my time with the Buds 3 Pro.</p><p>There are also Voice Controls now that you can use without having to wake Bixby or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. Going into the app and activating voice controls allows you to control simple functions by saying things like "Play music," "Next song," or "Previous song." Though there aren&apos;t many commands available, they do provide enough options to control the most important music-listening interactions, and they work <em>very well!</em> I was highly impressed. </p>

<p>Let’s talk sound now. First, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro achieve their ultimate sonic form when paired with a newer Galaxy phone like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24</a> series device. As noted, I tested with an S22 Ultra, and the sound experience was excellent, and I could still experience Samsung’s proprietary Samsung Scalable Codec in action. The Buds 3 Pro are the first Galaxy Buds with a two-way speaker featuring a planar tweeter and dual amp, and when you combine that with the app’s EQ and 360 Audio, you get crisp, airy sound that still has powerful bass cannon tuning and satisfying mid-frequency punch.</p><p>Activating 360 Audio increases the soundstage but boosts high frequencies and upper mids at the expense of bass response, so I activated the equalizer and used the Bass Boost preset. I figured that out after playing around with all the settings for a while. With those settings and the new driver tech, the opening acapella intro to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” sounds as airy and big as it should be. Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” which is one of my favorite tracks to test how well stereo imaging is reproduced, sounds terrific through the Buds 3 Pro, which have an enjoyable musicality to them while also giving you a deep thumping bass response as that upright bass thumps in Mingus’ masterpiece.</p><p>Be careful, though, because with some vocal-focused tracks and wailing guitars, 360 Audio becomes a bit stilted in the highs and can take on some sibilance.</p><p>Jamiroquai’s “Starchild” was presents quite well. Jay Kay’s vocals are bright and crisp, and the guitar, bass guitar, and other instrumentation are reproduced just as well through the new two-way speaker system.</p><p>Bass heads won’t need to worry! Skrillex’s “Mumbai Place” has nuclear bass and sub-bass, which was well represented through the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. There is definitely some amplification of the bottom end with the Buds 3 Pro, but not at the expense of the other frequencies. I didn’t feel like the bass response bleeds into mids or overpowers vocals at any time. </p>

<p>Your mileage may vary before you play with it and find the right sound for you, but I can also say that the default tuning out of the Buds 3 Pro is a good experience as well. Minus having 360 Audio turned on — as was the case when I paired the phone to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, which doesn&apos;t support the feature — the Buds 3 Pro still present a highly satisfying listening experience. While you may not have the SSC codec on a device like the Pixel 7 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE is supported</a>. Overall, the quality is much warmer without 360 Audio, but the soundstage is still surprisingly large for Bluetooth, closed-back listening devices.</p><p>Rounding out the audio experience, you’ll get adjustable ANC and ambient sound modes and an adaptive noise-canceling mode. Airplane cabin noise of 80dB was hushed wonderfully, with only the top-end frequencies present but greatly dulled.</p><p>Ambient mode is very transparent, with no hiss, and gives one of the best balances of music to ambient noise I’ve used in a pair of earbuds in recent memory. It’s one thing to have a great hear-through mode, but another to play music with it at a level that is still enjoyable while being able to hear quality detail from the world around you. A+ for Samsung on its implementation of Ambient mode.</p>

<p>Also, the microphone quality on these is <em>really</em> good. I tested them in quiet places and in urban settings with all of the ambient traffic, cars honking, and construction noise, and while they don&apos;t kill background noise like some others, they <em>do</em> a great job of making sure your voice comes through strong over any background noise. The problem with noise cancellation on many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> is that they make you sound like you&apos;re in a tunnel, or your voice cuts out as the AI works overtime to try to cancel out background sounds. I appreciate what Samsung did here.</p><p>One last note on what I like. Living in a very beach-friendly state, I’m glad Samsung finally added dust resistance to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Buds 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> were water resistance rated only.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zdUAGfW7FqKCjqqvvGY9uU" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-closeup-S22-Ultra.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sitting on top of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zdUAGfW7FqKCjqqvvGY9uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the touch controls are intuitive, and responsive, they still make me feel as though I’m unseating the earbuds when manipulating them. Despite the fact that often, that isn’t the case.</p><p>As for the design, getting the earbuds into their wireless charging-supported case is my only issue, as they’re a bit of a pain to place. That said, the colors on the case are a nice touch, as seeing that light blue at the bottom of the left stem can be a bit rough at times for those whose vision isn’t 20/20.</p><p>Having access to all of the features of the earbuds at your fingertips requires also having the last two generations of Galaxy S-Class devices or Flip and Fold devices. More devices <em>could be</em> added in the future, but as I always say, you need to be happy with exactly what you’re getting <em>today</em> because feature upgrades, if they do come, could be a way off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nWuY2iK4oH7zgnY4zFHhGQ" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-S22-Ultra.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWuY2iK4oH7zgnY4zFHhGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn’t necessarily something I don’t like, but it’s worth mentioning because it could be a pain. Voice Detect is an awesome feature that automatically turns on Ambient mode when the earbuds detect speaking. The problem you may encounter is that if you’re like me and start to sing whatever song is amping you up during your workout, your audio will dip.</p><p>I forget about this feature sometimes when I’m having a brisk walk and getting into my music, then I’m slightly annoyed that I have to be quiet. I’d love to see a future software update that adds a Galaxy Watch Buds Control shortcut to activate or deactivate this feature during workouts.</p>

<p>Much like AirPods, there isn’t any direct competition because of the Samsung ecosystem integration.

<p>Great sound, a robust feature set, and brilliant Samsung ecosystem connectivity make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro the ideal pair of Bluetooth earbuds for newer Samsung Galaxy and Z-series device owners. That and the microphone call quality are why I recommend them and have called them a "must-have" for Samsung owners.</p><p>Even if stem-style earbuds don’t work for you, like me, these are worth trying. Plus, they have a great, understated look with design elements that grab you. If you live a very active lifestyle, I recommend installing a pair of Comply foam ear tips for an extra secure fit.</p>

<p>Google typically has a little fun with its major OS releases, and Android 15 is no different as we get our hands on a space theme.</p><p>For Android 15, Google&apos;s little "Bugdroid" (Android&apos;s mascot) flies through space before landing on a planet (Earth) and planting a cute yellow flag. Not only does this year&apos;s OS easter egg expand on what we&apos;ve seen with Android 14, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/android-15-landroid/">9to5Google</a> found another side to this year&apos;s quirky addition.</p><p>After viewing the easter egg for the first time, Google turns the quick video into a usable screen saver for Android devices. Enrolled testers will find the screen saver called "Landroid" with "AUTOPILOT ENGAGED" as its brief description.</p><p>All of this is said to play automatically after enabling, meaning users can watch Android&apos;s mascot soar over the stars and mark its presence with a flag. Those with a Pixel Tablet or Pixel Tablet 2 can find it by hopping into <strong>Settings > Hub Mode > Screen Saver</strong>. After selecting, Landroid will play whenever your device is "locked or docked."</p><p>Google&apos;s line of eligible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evowizz/status/1814345966096408893">Pixel phones can see this</a>, too. Those users can enter their <strong>Settings > Display & Touch > Screen Saver </strong>to find Landroid <em>after </em>viewing the easter egg. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/android-15s-space-themed-easter-egg-touches-down-on-terra-firma/">publication states</a> this can be done by heading into your Settings in Android 15 Beta 4.</p><p>After that, head into About Phone and tap "Android Version" three times to produce the Android 15 logo, which you should long-press until the game activates.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 is fun, but did you find the *new* Easter egg?After accessing Landroid, you'll find...

One of the biggest highlights of the update is the company&apos;s shift from PNGs to vector emojis. In short, this will enable users to enjoy and experience their emojis in a larger form factor without sacrificing quality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> were another aspect of the latest beta release.</p><p>Discoveries in the code also pointed toward more information about Pixel&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>." While more details about its function were found, it seems Google could charge users for those services if they want to keep it.</p><p>With Beta 4, we&apos;re moving ever closer to a full release of Android 15. As developers continue to prepare their apps for the next major shift in software, there&apos;s speculation that we could see it arrive alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Pixel 9 series in August</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google is pulling the plug for shortened links created via Google URL Shortener.</li><li>The popular goo.gl links will no longer work after August 25, 2025.</li><li>Google will also be showcasing a new interstitial page for users to notify about the new move starting this August.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced that links created via its URL Shortener will no longer be available starting next year. The company shared the announcement through a developer&apos;s blog post.</p><p>Google introduced its URL Shortener back in 2009—an easy way to shorten and share links and simultaneously measure their domain&apos;s traffic. It would make any URL shorter with the "https://goo.gl/*" form. </p><p>In 2018, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/transitioning-google-url-shortener-to-firebase-dynamic-links/">turned down</a> support for it and encouraged users to utilize new Firebase Dynamic Links (FDL), which were supposedly smarter. However, for users/ developers who created through the former URL Shortener, Google allowed the links to still redirect to the intended destination.</p>
<p>Well, that is about to change, according to Google&apos;s announcement this Thursday (July 18). While Google had already disabled the ability to create newer goog.gl links, the existing links will no longer work starting August 25, 2025. The company is further planning to display an interstitial page for users who use goog.gl links. It will notify users that those links will not be supported after the said date before navigating to the intended destination assigned to the goog.gl link.</p><p>Some users will be notified via an interstitial page starting August 23, 2024. This percentage will gradually increase until the shutdown happens next year.</p><p>"This interstitial page should help you track and adjust any affected links that you will need to transition as part of this change. We will continue to display this interstitial page until the shutdown date, after which all links served will return a 404 response," the search giant notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">blog post</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.39%;"><img id="Xk3tcK48RQxuLwiCQDjuo6" name="google-url-shortener-shutting-down.jpg" alt="Google URL Shortener shutting down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk3tcK48RQxuLwiCQDjuo6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users have to bear in mind that the interstitial page "may cause disruptions" in the current flow of goog.gl links. Google further explains, "For example, if you are using other 302 redirects, the interstitial page may prevent the redirect flow from completing correctly. If you&apos;ve embedded social metadata in your destination page, the interstitial page will likely cause these to no longer show up where the initial link is displayed. For this reason, we advise transitioning these links as soon as possible."</p><p>Users having issues with the shortened links are allowed to contact Firebase support with any questions or concerns, as the new move from the search giant may cause them inconvenience while using the existing goog.gl shortened links.</p>

<ul><li>A new female voice for Gemini is apparently being tested, providing users with two voice options now.</li><li>The new voice feature is currently only available for Android users, not iOS or web.</li><li>The new voice options are in a limited trial phase and are not yet globally available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been tweaking its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> language model, and the next update might be a brand-new voice interface.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> currently offers a variety of voice options, but Google&apos;s new AI assistant, Gemini, which might replace Assistant, has only had one voice so far. However, a recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/gemini-new-voice/#more-631041" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> suggests this is about to change as Google is working on adding more voice options for Gemini.</p><p>At this year&apos;s Google I/O conference, the company announced plans to roll out a wider selection of realistic voice options for users to choose from.</p><p>Then, about a month ago, early signs indicated that Google was working on a new voice setup for Gemini, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-new-voices-3452126/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Back then, the feature was still in its early stages, meaning it wasn&apos;t operational at the time.</p><p>9to5&apos;s report reveals that Google is experimenting with a new female voice for its Gemini AI. Now, users can choose between two different voices. The new voice sounds much more natural compared to the previous, more mechanical-sounding option.</p><p>Unfortunately, this improved voice experience is only available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> right now, with iOS and web users unable to access the new voice yet. Plus, there&apos;s no option to switch back to the original voice.</p><p>Furthermore, it looks like this voice enhancement is in a limited trial phase and isn&apos;t available to users worldwide yet.</p><p>Having multiple voice options might not be groundbreaking, but it definitely improves the user experience. These kinds of improvements can boost user adoption since voice personalization is a common expectation for digital assistants nowadays.</p><p>Google&apos;s latest move seems like a direct response to OpenAI&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more-tools-to-chatgpt-free/" target="_blank">recent new voice features for GPT-4o</a>. The fierce competition in the generative AI field has sped up development timelines, and Google&apos;s quick release of extra voice options for Gemini shows just how fierce the race is.</p>

It comes with 128GB of storage, and the powerful Google Tensor G2 processor that makes performance smooth and fun to use.</p><p>All in all, this economy-priced phone looks even more appealing at almost half off, especially for those who like the Pixel ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> having a phone with a high-quality camera is a selling point for you; you want something that offers many years of software updates; you&apos;re already a fan of or own other Pixel products.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d prefer to spend a little more on extra battery life; you need a phone with more than 5W charging; you&apos;d prefer the newer Pixel 8a. </p><p>Despite being a last-gen device, the Pixel 7a remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> available today. We like it for its high-quality photo- and video-taking capabilities and features, as well as its aesthetically pleasing 6.1-inch AMOLED screen. The Pixel 7a also comes with five years of Pixel updates, super smooth performance due to the Tensor G2 chipset, which is also shared by the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. Beyond that, users like that it offers IP67 water and dust resistance, and the 7a generally performs better than its more affordable smartphone peers.</p><p>To be sure, the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> is the better midrange Pixel phone, but if you&apos;re looking at a budget of around 300 bucks, you&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find a deal better than this. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung spent a while teasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, after previewing it at the first Unpacked of the year and showing it off in more detail at Mobile World Congress. However, it was far from certain that the smart ring would be a success. There were rumors about an expensive pricing model that could&apos;ve featured a high upfront cost <em>and</em> a subscription. Plus, Samsung was going against brands like Oura and others which have a lot more experience in the space.</p><p>It seems like even Samsung might&apos;ve doubted how much of a hit the Galaxy Ring would be. The smart ring sold out just a few days after pre-orders opened up, and far before the ring&apos;s official release date. Third-party retailers kept accepting Galaxy Ring preorders but made no official estimation of when they might ship. </p><p>As of late last week, the Galaxy Ring became available again, albeit with long shipping windows. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/18/samsung-galaxy-ring-restock-delayed-shipping/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first discovered the restock and noted that some sizes are still hard to get, even after Samsung started accepting preorders for the Galaxy Ring again. In fact, some combinations of sizes and colors are still sold out completely. </p><p>The official release date for the Galaxy Ring is July 24, but buyers who place a preorder now will have to wait significantly longer than that. Some uncommon sizes and colorways are available sooner than the more popular ones. You can get a Galaxy Ring in size six and the titanium silver color for delivery on July 26, just a few days after the release date. However, sizes 10 and 12 come with Aug. 7 delivery dates, and you won&apos;t get a size 11 ring until Aug. 21.</p><p>If you need a size 13 ring, you&apos;re completely out of luck. Delivery is "unavailable" for a Galaxy Ring in that size — for any colorway — and you&apos;re not able to place a preorder at all. </p>

<p>We don&apos;t know how many smart rings Samsung made in its initial production run, so it&apos;s hard to call the Galaxy Ring a resounding success this early. It is clear that demand has exceeded supply, and that does tell us one of two things. Either the company played it safe, testing the waters before placing high-volume production orders. Or, it underestimated the demand for the Galaxy Ring entirely, and was surprised by the overwhelming amount of preorders. </p><p>Regardless of which possible scenario is actually true, it&apos;s still impressive that the Galaxy Ring sold out so early. You have to consider that the initial wave of preorders came before most initial reviews of the Galaxy Ring were live. That means early buyers were mostly going off of Samsung&apos;s claims and the media&apos;s first impressions, and enough people bought in based on that alone. </p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-galaxy-ring-so-popular-2">Why is the Galaxy Ring so popular?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3937px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-hands-on-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4b5saqQ7cfSP9bZPWD9ysM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3937" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I ended up placing a preorder for the Galaxy Ring, though I bought mine <em>after</em> it sold out, so I don&apos;t have a delivery date at all currently. As an early buyer, I think there are two main reasons why the Galaxy Ring has been so popular already despite not even being officially released yet. The first one is that smart rings are the real deal. It&apos;s easy to say they&apos;re a gimmick because they have basic sensors and no on-device interface. But that&apos;s far from the case. </p><p>The benefit of a smart ring is that you can wear it all the time. With a smartwatch, you have to keep it charged, and it&apos;s bulky. I can&apos;t wear a smartwatch to bed — it&apos;s just too clunky and uncomfortable — and I lose out on sleep-tracking insights as a result. Even a slim tracker like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0</a> is too disruptive. That&apos;s where a smart ring comes in. You can wear it in the shower, during your day-to-day life, and to bed. With long battery life and quick charging, you can wear a smart ring almost every hour of every day. </p><p>Now, the second reason the Galaxy Ring is a hit is because it&apos;s the first smart ring to deeply integrate with a smartphone ecosystem. It&apos;s true that devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">Oura Ring</a> work on both iOS and Android, but they don&apos;t have deeper integration, and people want that deep integration. There&apos;s a reason Apple users buy an Apple Watch, Pixel users buy a Pixel Watch, and Galaxy users buy a Galaxy Watch. It just creates a better experience. </p><p>Samsung is quietly building a compelling health ecosystem with the Galaxy Ring and the Galaxy Watch at the forefront. It&apos;s appealing to me, and apparently, it&apos;s appealing to many others. We shouldn&apos;t discount how impressive it is that the Galaxy Ring sold out in the preorder stage, and we definitely shouldn&apos;t discredit smart rings in general.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the anticipation building for Google&apos;s latest hardware, the tech giant is already teasing a special offer for early Pixel 9 Pro pre-orders.</p><p>If you&apos;re in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, or Singapore, you can get a free “limited-edition collectible” with your Pixel 9 Pro pre-order. This news comes straight from some teasers at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/tw/magazine/google_pixel_9_pro?hl=zh-TW&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Store</a> in Taiwan, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/pixel-9-pro-pre-order-gift/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The report reveals that this special item will come in a square box decorated with the iconic Google "G" logo and Google Store branding. Considering Google&apos;s trend toward compact packaging for its Pixel devices, there&apos;s speculation that this outer box might contain the regular Pixel retail package, with the collectible tucked inside, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-pro-pre-order-mystery-collectible-box/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>.</p><p>Google is fueling the excitement about the box&apos;s contents by hinting that it’s tied to Pixel&apos;s design legacy.</p><p><em>"Own a piece of Google Pixel design history, exclusively for the first orders of our new Pixel 9 Pro phones. Limited time while supply lasts—be quick."</em></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1509px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.15%;"><img id="bJosWpHdm74YpvV9ndMeG4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-collectible.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro collectible teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJosWpHdm74YpvV9ndMeG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1509" height="802" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Store (Taiwan))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though Google hints that the collectible is a piece of Pixel design history, the exact item is still a mystery. Sadly, its vague description also rules out the possibility of it being a Pixel Watch or Buds.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>&apos;s pre-order campaign last year offered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> as a complimentary incentive to early adopters.</p><p>Nevertheless, consumers usually see a bunch of limited-time incentives on launch day. These often feature discounts and Google Store credit for accessories.</p><p>The teaser popped up a few days after Google showed off some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">previews of the Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Pixel 9 Pro Fold in its latest promo videos</a>.</p><p>Sadly, this special pre-order bonus is only available in Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, leaving Pixel fans in other regions disappointed.</p><p>Choosing those Asia-Pacific countries for the exclusive pre-order incentive is an interesting move by Google. This targeted approach seems to be a deliberate effort to boost sales and market presence for the premium Pixel 9 Pro in these regions.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Marketing for the new OnePlus Watch 2R styles it as a sporty, long-lasting Wear OS watch for "inspiring an active lifestyle," with a lighter design for "those who value all-day fitness" tracking. I love watches that cater directly to me, but my colleagues who tested the OnePlus Watch 2 bashed its health data as its Achilles&apos; heel. So I decided to test the Watch 2R accuracy for myself.</p><p>With the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, our reviewer Harish complained that it "just isn&apos;t reliable at daily step counts or activity tracking," that it misjudged burned calories after workouts, and that its stress data was artificially elevated. </p><p>Meanwhile, my colleague Nick did a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">one-week OnePlus Watch 2 test</a> and had similar complaints about underestimated steps and significantly lower HR numbers during anaerobic workouts. Both Nick and Harish suspected that the watch used its low-power RTOS coprocessor to handle health and fitness sampling and that it wasn&apos;t fast or consistent enough to get proper readings.</p><p>This made me leery about testing the OnePlus Watch 2R, a fitness watch that theoretically couldn&apos;t handle fitness all that well. So, just like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a> last week, I strapped on two smartwatches to see how the Watch 2R could match up against my Garmin Forerunner 965 for heart rate and dual-band GPS accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="my-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test-2">My OnePlus Watch 2R fitness test</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-versus-Garmin-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2R (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jBLuUaCjpPSwj6RNaqJSS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus&apos; OHealth companion app doesn&apos;t let you export TCX/GPX files like Samsung Health, and I had some issues getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> to send my data properly, so I couldn&apos;t do my usual HR or GPS charts for a direct comparison; I&apos;ll use tables as an alternative for now.</p>

<p>For my first jog, the OnePlus Watch 2R stayed mostly on track with the Garmin Forerunner 965. I spot-checked heart rates at ten different timestamps, and the 2R matched the 965 four times and was 1bpm short six times, which dovetails with the 1bpm-lower average.</p><p>GPS accuracy mostly remained on point. It&apos;s difficult to say if OnePlus&apos; dual-band accuracy is more or less reliable than Garmin&apos;s since both maps had me straying off the sidewalk at odd moments, but I appreciated that both fell into the same general ballpark for a run with some signal-blocking foliage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-running-form-stats.jpeg" alt="Running form data on the OnePlus Watch 2R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNhfwnyfVhHuac6RGU34TP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for running dynamics, the OnePlus Watch 2R synced pretty well for stride length and average vertical ratio, but measured my vertical oscillation as 1cm shorter and average ground contact time as 18ms longer.</p>

<p>I ran eight 400m laps for my second track run, and Garmin predictably stayed on point because it uses saved track maps to judge your likely location. OnePlus had more issues: the Watch 2R buzzed my wrist with lap or mile times at about the 350m mark, consistently. It was as if the starting point was completely wrong, but then the GPS was pinpoint-accurate when I hit that incorrect spot. Still, it threw my calculated pace off by a decent margin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-and-Garmin-Forerunner-965.jpeg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2R (left) and Garmin Forerunner 965 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4BrP6943h4EJGA2oK3nkuM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I figured the heart rate for a hard-paced track workout would be the sticking point, but its HR average was more accurate than the Galaxy Watch Ultra during my track workout last week. It certainly fell short of Garmin&apos;s results — typically 1–3 bpm short at a given moment — but typically leveled out to the correct number given enough time. Certainly, the Watch 2R did much better than the Watch 2 in this area.</p><p>Again, OnePlus&apos; running dynamics data diverged from Garmin in small ways. I don&apos;t quite get how OnePlus said I took more steps per minute while leaving my feet on the ground for longer. However, I realized after my run that OHealth had my height listed as 5&apos;7 (I&apos;m 6&apos;1), so maybe that skewed the results for things like vertical oscillation. Regardless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form data isn&apos;t worth obsessing over</a>, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="overall-oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-impressions-2">Overall OnePlus Watch 2R fitness impressions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-heart-rate-summary.jpeg" alt="Post-run heart rate average and max on the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dL65yD2j4NR4LL4X2UuTWL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This might simply be a case of low expectations skewing my impressions, but the OnePlus Watch 2R feels like a strong budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>. It has a comfortable weight for its display size, three-day battery life with Wear OS 4, Google Assistant, and a $229 price tag that I&apos;d expect from an Amazfit watch — not something with proper app support.</p><p>OHealth provides some in-depth and surprisingly accessible data for running, offering detailed context for certain stats like training effect, running dynamics, VO2 Max, and recovery time — though Garmin wants me to rest an extra day and has my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> slightly lower. </p><p>That said, it&apos;s still quite basic compared to other tie-in fitness apps. OHealth provides a lot of individual run data, but its long-term training load and workout summary data is on the simplistic side. If I used the Watch 2R long-term, I&apos;d most likely auto-sync the data to Strava and rely on that instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR" name="oneplus-watch-2-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaYZeCsUThPK9Bg86qGJBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The OnePlus Watch 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Circling back to my colleagues&apos; complaints about the original OnePlus Watch 2, my final step count across both runs was 11,670 for the Forerunner 965 and 11,560 for the Watch 2R. </p><p>Garmin watches beat every other brand in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">first</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">second step-counting tests</a>, so I&apos;ll treat the first number as an accurate control group. About 100 steps off across 11,000 steps is almost a rounding error, and significantly better than the OnePlus Watch 2 vs. the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> across the same distance (1,860 short). The same goes for my recent Galaxy Watch Ultra test against the Forerunner 965 after 10,000 steps (348 steps short).</p><p>OnePlus did underreport my burned calories compared to Garmin, but to be honest, I&apos;ve <strong>never</strong> seen any two watch brands agree on how many calories you&apos;ve burned. I don&apos;t know what goes into that algorithm and how to tell which ones flatter or sell you short. So I&apos;m not too fussed about it looking like OnePlus is on the low end, since it&apos;s just an estimate.</p><p>Really, my biggest complaint with the OnePlus Watch 2R is the same one I have with the Galaxy Watch Ultra: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">lack of a crown</a>. OnePlus gave the Watch 2 an inactive crown that spins and does nothing, while the Watch 2 has two simple buttons, one of which pulls up workouts by default unless you change the shortcut. I do appreciate that, but the sweaty-stained displays in the pics above should show why I don&apos;t like relying on swipes during workouts. Give me up/down buttons or a crown any day.</p><p>I need more time for a full OnePlus Watch 2R review that dives deeper into the health and sleep side of things. But I&apos;m much more bullish about its chances of being worthwhile for casual athletes than I was a week ago -- and matching up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android watches</a> for quality.</p>

<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s most compelling attribute arguably lies within its camera system. This really shows TECNO&apos;s determination to earn the title of "flagship killer."</p><p>The phone is packed with a powerful quad-camera system, led by a 50MP Sony IMX890 main sensor. Supporting it are three additional 50MP cameras: a wide-angle lens for stunning landscapes, a macro lens for detailed close-ups, and a portrait lens. For selfies, there&apos;s a 50MP front camera with autofocus and eye-tracking capabilities.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s innovative PolarAce technology powers this impressive setup, featuring the Sony CXD5622G imaging chip. This chip is the first to offer "end-side FP16 floating-point computing with the power of 4.6TFLOPS@FP16."</p><p>The technical specs might sound complex, so let&apos;s break down what they mean for you. This phone promises sharper videos even in low light, thanks to AI noise reduction and HDR for balanced lighting. However, it&apos;s not all roses (more on that later). Regardless, the 4K portrait video feature allowed me to take high-resolution close-ups with a blurred background.</p>

<p>TECNO might be throwing around a lot of technical terms for its camera system, but the key takeaway is this: it uses a powerful dual-chip setup, featuring a Sony imaging chip, to deliver noticeably improved photos.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera tries to balance natural colors with vibrant ones. Most photos, especially landscapes, look great, but I noticed that the AI sometimes oversaturates scenes with lots of blue sky and green grass, making them look a bit unrealistic.</p><p>still, the handset&apos;s camera versatility shines here. Even without portrait mode, the main sensor achieves a beautiful depth of field. Furthermore, the 3x optical zoom delivers detailed close-ups, and HDR technology ensures balanced exposure in various lighting conditions. This phone&apos;s camera is a clear contender in its class.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The telephoto lens is exceptional with a dedicated 50MP sensor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One area where the Camon 30 Premier 5G punches above its weight is the telephoto lens. Unlike many budget phones, it boasts a dedicated 50MP sensor with 3x optical zoom, capturing crisp close-up shots without sacrificing detail. The ultra-wide camera, while not the absolute widest available, delivers impressive detail and good color fidelity that complements the main sensor.</p><p>The front-facing camera doesn&apos;t disappoint either. Autofocus, a feature typically found in premium phones, ensures sharp and detailed selfies. Additionally, the camera captures natural-looking skin tones.</p>

<p>While the Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s camera system delivers good results overall, there&apos;s room for improvement. A slightly lighter touch with image processing, particularly regarding AI saturation in certain scenarios, could elevate photo quality to even greater heights.</p><p>The phone&apos;s display is a also feast for the eyes. Sharp resolution and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate combine to create an immersive viewing experience that is perfect for devouring your favorite content.</p>

<p>The display boasts a fairly impressive 1400 nits of peak brightness, ideal for conquering glare in bright outdoor environments. However, enabling auto-brightness is necessary to access this level, and its reliability wasn&apos;t always perfect in my testing.</p><p>Thankfully, everyday tasks like social media scrolling, app launching, and web browsing felt smooth, with only occasional hiccups. Even demanding games like Genshin Impact ran decently at medium graphics with 60fps, though I experienced minor stutters in rare instances.</p><p>Endurance isn&apos;t a concern with the Camon 30 Premier 5G. Packing a generous 5,000mAh battery, it delivered more than eight hours of screen-on time during light use. This translates to ample power for all-day tasks.</p>

<p>The device ups the ante with a speedy 70W charger included in the box. In my tests, it fueled the phone from empty to more than 50% in just 15 minutes, with a full charge taking around 40 minutes. That&apos;s impressive for a phone in this price range.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G&apos;s design hints at a company pushing boundaries. Unboxing it reveals a phone that aspires to a more premium aesthetic. While its flat-edged metallic frame follows current trends, the phone really shines with its unique "Tech-Art Leather" back. This material, featuring a snowy motif, integrates with the matte plastic texture and silver frame, creating a captivating interplay of textures and visual intrigue.</p><p>Its camera module also reminds me of classic cameras. It features a fixed zoom ring around the lenses, adding a nostalgic touch and helping with heat dissipation, according to TECNO. That said, it does not have any practical function at all.</p><p>Enhancing the premium feel, the Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts TECNO&apos;s strongest aluminum frame yet, housed in a remarkably high-quality case included in the box.</p><p>Despite weighing 210g, the Camon 30 Premier 5G feels surprisingly comfortable in hand. This is likely due to its well-thought-out design that ensures balanced weight distribution.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="aKJjP2goqSBTQfMdaFa9A8" name="TECNO-Camon-30-Premier-5G-10-2.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKJjP2goqSBTQfMdaFa9A8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G boasts impressive specs for photo capture, video recording is an area for improvement. Despite offering 4K resolution at 30fps or 60fps, stabilization falls short, particularly in low-light conditions. Footage can appear shaky, and even daytime recordings lack the smoothness I expected, even with a gimbal.</p><p>However, the biggest downside of the phone is its software. TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 skin, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and the overall software strategy have several shortcomings that I can&apos;t overlook.</p><p>Although it&apos;s smooth and functional, the software is somewhat unattractive and cluttered with unnecessary apps, many of which can&apos;t be uninstalled. It&apos;s not just the number of apps but also the fact that most users won&apos;t recognize names like AHA Games, Ella, and Hi Theme.</p><p>Simply put, the old problem of bloatware is still present. You&apos;ll find the usual duplicate web browser, a custom voice assistant awkwardly running alongside Google&apos;s, and a separate app store.</p><p>TECNO&apos;s HiOS 14 introduces a mandatory TECNO account sign-up process, which some users might find inconvenient. Additionally, swiping left no longer brings up the familiar Google Discover feed; instead, it displays TECNO&apos;s own selection of widgets. These widgets, which include recently used apps and phone usage stats, might not appeal to everyone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Software is functional but unattractive and cluttered with non-removable bloatware.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The company&apos;s update policy for the Camon 30 Premier 5G is also a concern. The phone is only promised two major OS upgrades, lagging behind competitors like Xiaomi, which offers three, and OnePlus, which offers four. Additionally, TECNO hasn&apos;t specified how often these updates will be released.</p><p>While the software experience has room for improvement, TECNO does introduce some interesting features. For instance, the built-in dialer app integrates a WhatsApp icon, allowing you to initiate direct messages without saving contacts beforehand.</p><p>TECNO pre-installs its Ella GPT AI assistant, too, offering an alternative to Google Assistant. While Ella GPT can handle basic tasks, it may not be suitable for complex instructions or extended conversations. Users seeking a more robust AI experience might prefer established options like Gemini or ChatGPT.</p><p>Another feature that caught my eye was the AI-powered wallpaper generator, similar to the one in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-note-40-pro-plus-review">Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus 5G</a> (this makes sense, given that both brands are owned by the same parent company). While many smartphone manufacturers are adding generative AI features, TECNO&apos;s approach is pretty unique, and I hope it becomes more popular.</p>

<p>The TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G is a solid choice in its price range. It packs features and performance that can go head-to-head with established models like the Samsung Galaxy A55 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a>, making it a great value for those watching their budget.</p><p>While boasting a slightly higher price point than the TECNO Camon 30 Premier 5G, the Samsung Galaxy A55 positions itself as a reliable option. It excels in battery life and display quality, effortlessly handling everyday tasks. However, its camera system might not be the absolute strongest in this price range, and the absence of wireless charging may be a drawback for some users. In the end, the Galaxy A55 focuses on practicality rather than flashy features, appealing to those who want a dependable, no-frills phone.</p><p>Xiaomi steps up its mid-range game with the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus. The phone exudes a more premium aesthetic with its improved design and exceptional display.  This iteration welcomes back the crowd-pleasing features of rapid charging and a powerful main camera but retains the brand&apos;s well-documented software shortcomings. Despite this, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus cements Xiaomi&apos;s position in the sub-$400 market, offering a solid option for budget-conscious consumers looking for a well-rounded device.</p>
