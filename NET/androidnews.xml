The new law enforcement sweep, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">Operation AI Comply</a>, is using existing fair trade and consumer protection laws to target DoNotPay, Ascend Ecom, Ecommerce Empire Builders, FBA Machine, and Rytr charging that these companies use "AI tools to trick, mislead, or defraud people" and makes it clear that AI is not exempt from current laws.</p>

<p>Four of the five cases were unanimous decisions, while the case against Ryter was authorized 3-2, with Commissioners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-joined-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-matter-rytr">Melissa Holyoak</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-joined-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-matter-rytr">Andrew Ferguson</a> voting against taking action. The FTC makes it very clear it will not tolerate "unfair or deceptive practices in these markets, [and] is ensuring that honest businesses and innovators can get a fair shot and consumers are being protected.”</p>
<p>It&apos;s about time, I say. I&apos;m very familiar with the weirdly inaccurate terms <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-leveraging-machine-learning-make-duo-calls-sound-better">machine learning</a> and AI. I understand the strong points of software that can use one sort of information to present a different sort, and I understand how useful it can be. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">I also hate reading and writing about AI</a> because of its reckless addition to everything and the actual harm it brings.</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about smart robots that destroy humanity or how people with bad intentions can do bad things using AI instead of other tools. I&apos;m talking about how AI can be used to trick even the most tech-savvy among us and how this happens every day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VJ4NvuATz4hoU3GTRAK6H5" name="Google-IO-2023-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Photos AI Magic Editor at Google IO 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ4NvuATz4hoU3GTRAK6H5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These five cases from the FTC showcase why AI is bad. AI will never replace a living, breathing lawyer, and the claims that it can are simply lies. People who believed those lies were not properly represented when they took it upon themselves to appear in front of judges without an actual attorney.</p><p>AI is not able to build an online storefront that will make you millions. That requires hard work from you and a great idea or a large gift of cash from your parents. AI can write fake reviews for products to try and manipulate potential buyers, but that&apos;s not legal. None of these five businesses have any right to exist because they prey on consumers with bogus promises and deceptive schemes. The FTC says these companies were using AI to "turbocharge deception" and I could not say it any better.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that it took this long for a small sample of offensive companies who used the AI buzzword to steal money from the unsuspecting public. I&apos;d also like to see much harsher penalties, so I guess I have a second complaint.</p><p>I do understand at least part of the problem, though. It seems like everyone is sitting around waiting for some magical AI regulations to happen at the federal level. While waiting, it seemed that nothing was being done using existing laws to weed out the predators. Again, I also realize I&apos;m not a lawyer and have no idea what it takes to build a solid case against a business, and an AI lawyer is very vague on the subject.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.38%;"><img id="nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB" name="AI-lawer.jpg" alt="AI replies are bad." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We need some common sense federal AI regulations. Not the kind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-ai-bill-makes-companies-liable-for-users">that causes undue levels of bureaucracy</a> and red tape or the kind that stifles honest innovation, but the kind that protects consumers like you and me against deceptive businesses like the ones mentioned by the FTC. I have no idea if that can ever happen with the current level of division between political parties, but I have my doubts. We&apos;ll have to settle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive orders</a> in the meantime.</p><p>Until then, using the laws that already exist to protect us from fraud sounds like a grand plan. Deceptive business practices don&apos;t become less deceptive because AI wrote the web page that describes them. The people committing the potential fraud will do it with or without AI, just like people who make fake political ads.</p><p>If we get that sorted out, maybe we can start using AI to do a few good things instead of constantly bickering about how bad it is.</p>

Among these early offers is a discount that slashes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank"><strong>54% off on the Amazon Fire HD 8 (2022) tablet</strong></a>, bringing an already-affordable device down to under $60 — and to its lowest price ever.</p><p>The Fire HD 8 is really nothing special on the performance side, but at this price, it may be a good option for kids or casual users who just want a basic tablet. It&apos;s worth noting that this version comes with lockscreen ads, though it also includes 64GB of storage or 1TB of expandable storage via a microSD slot.</p><p>Even if the Fire HD 8 isn&apos;t quite what you&apos;re looking for, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale"><strong>Amazon&apos;s early deals</strong></a> include a handful of deals on tablets, phones, and other devices. Again, Amazon is also holding its next Big Deal Days sale on October 8th and 9th, which will undoubtedly feature a lot of great tech discounts for Prime members. Haven&apos;t joined up yet? Sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and you&apos;ll enjoy all of the benefits of the sale without paying a dime. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review">2022 Amazon Fire HD 8</a> is an impressive 54% off for a limited time, weeks ahead of the upcoming Prime Day sale. Don't expect a high-performance tablet with this effort from Amazon, but those wanting something cheap and basic certainly won't mind this price point.</p>
<p>This Fire HD 8 includes 64GB of storage and 13 hours of battery life, though it also comes with lockscreen ads.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f06bc46a-a7b3-46c1-87fe-cf7a3c7b2583" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$129.99" data-dimension48="$129.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a casual user looking for a cheap tablet or couch companion; you have other Amazon services that you regularly use; you need a tablet that&apos;s small and lightweight.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a high-performance tablet; you want easy access to more than just what the Amazon App Store has to offer; you need something with fast charging.</p><p>The affordability of the Amazon Fire HD 8 is probably its biggest strength, perhaps even making this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Amazon tablet</a> there is. Despite its performance being pretty basic, it also boasts 13 hours of battery life and easy access to Alexa and the Amazon ecosystem. It&apos;s a great option for kids or those who just need another device around, featuring 2MP cameras, a USB-C port, and easy-to-set parental controls.</p><p>The cons of this cheap Amazon tablet are that it only has 2GB of RAM, so performance is really nothing special, and it doesn&apos;t feature fast charging despite featuring a USB-C port. Still, you&apos;re unlikely to find anything this good at such a low price, and it&apos;s hard to say how long this deal will stick around.</p>

This spring, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">licensed out the Meta Horizon OS interface</a> to other companies so they could make their own wireless VR headsets with Snapdragon XR2 hardware, Meta&apos;s UI, and the Quest Store library of games and apps.</p><p>Specifically, Meta promised that ASUS ROG would make an "all-new performance gaming headset" running Horizon OS. It also said Lenovo would make "mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment" with the same OS. And it promised a "limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox." We&apos;ve yet to hear any news about these headsets in the five months since.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha" name="Meta-Horizon-OS.jpg" alt=""Made with Meta Horizon OS" printed on a box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central&apos;s VR squad, Nick Sutrich and I, hoped to see Meta x Microsoft Quest 3 at Connect. If Meta wants to make the Horizon OS concept take off and attract more hardware developers, we thought it might highlight partners&apos; headsets during its annual showcase alongside the Quest 3S.</p><p>Maybe the ASUS ROG headset would interfere with Quest 3S sales, but we assume it&apos;ll be more of a high-end gaming device for VR superfans compared to the budget 3S for people who found the Quest 3 too expensive. And Lenovo&apos;s productivity headset could have preempted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dont-expect-samsung-xr-headset-galaxy-unpacked-2024">Samsung&apos;s AWOL productivity device</a>.</p><p>Given Meta will probably make its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> with a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 3 before we know it, it makes sense that ASUS ROG and Lenovo would sell these headsets very soon — or have to wait a couple of years for newer hardware. That could make the whole third-party ecosystem lose steam before it can take off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="7EqTS8uMzr7gtNrW8HYZje" name="asus-rog-meta-horizon-os-headset.jpeg" alt="A render mockup of a woman playing a VR game wearing the ASUS ROG VR headset running Meta Horizon OS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7EqTS8uMzr7gtNrW8HYZje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta's mock-up for gaming on the ASUS ROG headset. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, why didn&apos;t we see anything from ASUS ROG, Lenovo, or any other partnership announcements? When we asked Meta VP Mark Rabkin, his answer was short and understandably cagey but still very revealing.</p><p>"I don&apos;t have anything I can disclose for now, but we have multiple programs going for those headsets. We&apos;re really trying to let our partners lead the way and have it be their device, their development, their stuff, so we would never push or preempt them, or anything like that," Rabkin said.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I gleaned from this response: (A) Meta stressed that it&apos;s directly supporting these partners on multiple fronts (probably both hardware and software); (B) pushing them to show something off by late September (or any Connect) would be presumptuous and intrusive on whatever they want to do; and (C) Meta probably won&apos;t publicize third-party headsets, the same way Google doesn&apos;t run ads for Samsung phones.</p><p>Our original comparison of Meta Quest as the new "Pixel of VR" feels especially apt. Meta stresses that it&apos;s opening up the ecosystem to other developers, but they&apos;re only partners in the sense that Meta will help other companies get started and charge a licensing fee for the software. It doesn&apos;t own or control these devices, and companies will announce and release them on their own timetable, not Meta&apos;s.</p><p>We&apos;re still hoping to see these headsets soon. With Meta&apos;s main competition being the exorbitant Apple Vision Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either">mostly-abandoned PSVR 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-pico-4-competition">struggling Pico brand</a>, and long-delayed Valve Index successor, it&apos;d be great to see fresh ideas in the VR space while still keeping our Quest libraries and familiar interface.</p>

The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> looks nearly identical to the other phones in the S24 family, with a flat design and triple camera system. The phone features a 6.7-inch display, which means it sits between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Since it&apos;s a Fan Edition phone, the specs aren&apos;t as strong as its siblings. As such, the phone is powered by an Exynos 2400e, which is a low-power version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> powering certain versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. There&apos;s also 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, and access to features from Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>On the back is a 50MP primary sensor with a 12MP ultrawide and 8MP 3x telephoto. Keeping the phone on is a 4700mAh battery with 25W wired charging. The phone is available in Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint, and Yellow for $649 in the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, Samsung also launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a>, consisting of the Galaxy S10 Plus and S10 Ultra. The former features a 12.4-inch display, while the latter has a 14.6-inch panel. Samsung switched things up this year, and instead of using a Snapdragon chip, both tablets are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>.

The new model features a similar design with a different lens array up front, and it&apos;s powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 chip. Meta cut costs by using cheaper lenses with lower resolutions and a narrower field of view. It also uses a software-based depth sensor and has a smaller battery, but you should still be able to play the same games as the flagship model.</p><p>The Quest 3S starts at $299 for the 128GB model and also comes in a 256GB model.

Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">finally started rolling out the update</a> earlier this week to the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2, bringing new features like an app grid, recorder app, and more. However, there have been some issues with the rollout, prompting Google to press pause on the update.</p><p>Some users have been complaining about the update bringing their devices, with one user saying their Pixel Watch 2 was unresponsive after updating, showing only a blank screen with a Bluetooth symbol. One Pixel Watch owner says the update took nearly four hours to complete but functioned just fine when it was done.</p><p>Not everyone experienced problems with the update, but the issues were enough for Google to pull the update while it works out the problems. Meanwhile, affected users can check out this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13575675">support page</a> to hopefully fix their devices.</p>

That means anyone else wishing to access Disney Plus will have to either get their own account or be added on as an extra member for $6.99 a month, at least for a Basic account. Premium members will have to pay $9.99 for an extra account outside their household. It should be noted that account holders can only have one extra member.</p><p>According to Disney, the new policy is available in the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on deceptive AI practices and launched legal action against companies making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">false AI claims</a> or offering tech that can be easily misused for fraud.</p><p>Operation AI Comply, the FTC&apos;s new program, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes" target="_blank">uncovered</a> five cases where companies used AI to boost deceptive practices. These include a so-called "robot lawyer," AI-generated fake reviews, and shady online storefronts.</p><p>One case involves DoNotPay, which claimed to have the “world’s first robot lawyer” that could sue anyone with just a click. Now, the FTC is scrutinizing the company for not following through on its promises.</p><p>DoNotPay offered services like using a virtual card to dodge free trial fees and filing complaints against businesses. However, the FTC claims it exaggerated its capabilities, saying things like users could "sue for assault without a lawyer" and quickly create valid legal documents.</p><p>The FTC has called out DoNotPay for making baseless claims that its &apos;robot lawyers&apos; could replace human lawyers in creating legal documents. DoNotPay had claimed it would "replace the $200 billion-dollar legal industry with artificial intelligence."</p><p>However, the FTC argues that DoNotPay had no evidence to back these claims. As a result, the company has agreed to a $193,000 settlement with the FTC.</p><p>The FTC is also going after companies that claimed AI could help people profit from online storefronts. One case involves Ascend Ecom, which supposedly misled individuals about their earning potential to lure them into investing in "risk-free" AI-driven business opportunities. The FTC claims Ascend Ecom didn’t honor its money-back guarantees when those investments didn’t pan out.</p><p>Besides the companies already mentioned, Ecommerce Empire Builders, Rytr, and FBA Machine are also being investigated by the FTC. The complaint against Rytr reveals that subscribers could use its AI platform to generate misleading fake reviews packed with false info that might mislead consumers. Some users ended up creating thousands of these questionable reviews.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ecommerce Empire Builders and FBA Machine tout that customers can cash in by investing in AI-powered online businesses. However, the FTC alleges that Ecommerce Empire Builders forces clients to sign contracts that stop them from leaving negative reviews.</p>

<p>Ever since the original iPad was released, I&apos;ve been intrigued and enthralled with the idea of having a slab of glass and metal at my disposal. In most instances, I prefer tablets that are smaller than my laptop but larger than whatever phone I end up carrying that day.</p><p>Before the days of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, this distinction was much easier and is probably why I still adore the Nexus 7. It just served a very distinct purpose and one that couldn&apos;t be served by either my phone or laptop. Unfortunately, we&apos;ve seen a downward trend in device sales across multiple product categories in recent years. However, tablets just experienced a surge that could prove the category is still alive and well.</p><p>Just before attending the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra</a> press event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52611024">a new report</a> from the International Data Corporation (IDC) was released. In this report, the IDC shares that "the tablet market is forecast to grow 7.2% year over year." While that might not seem like much of a jump, it&apos;s actually outpacing PCs, which is expected to "grow 4.3% year over year in 2025." </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jUj3MnxsxyeFLLuwmfn4Nf" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-and-2021-ipad-pro.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra and Apple iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jUj3MnxsxyeFLLuwmfn4Nf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering that there haven&apos;t been many innovations in the tablet space, I&apos;ve been trying to figure out why tablets are seeing a resurgence. There are a couple of different potential explanations for why this is the case, but first, let&apos;s look at why tablet sales suffered in the first place.</p><p>The obvious explanation for the downtrend was the end of the lockdown in 2021, but it&apos;s been three years since then. In that time, there really haven&apos;t been any game-changing device launches outside of the world of foldable phones, which makes the recent surge all the more surprising. After all, tablets remain slabs of glass and either plastic or metal, all with differing software experiences. </p><p>Arguably, Amazon and Google have pushed the envelope a bit further, expanding the capabilities of your tablets by turning them into smart home displays. Meanwhile, Samsung has mostly kept things "business as normal," while Apple still can&apos;t figure out how to implement proper multi-tasking on the extremely overpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a> lineup.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-review-1-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 with S Pen back silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, despite this stagnation, why are tablets on the uptick? The first idea that came to mind is that it&apos;s likely been at least two or three years since people last purchased a tablet. That&apos;s a pretty decent upgrade period, somewhat falling in line with getting a new smartphone. </p><p>Another factor here is that Android has matured quite a bit in that timeframe. Not to mention that we didn&apos;t begin seeing the promise of longer software updates for devices until 2022. Samsung now offers seven years of updates, surpassing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>&apos;s three years of major OS upgrades and five years of security patches. </p>

<p>The other idea has more to do with the way that I look at tablets, as they can either operate as an extension of my phone or computer or by themselves. Leaning on Samsung again, both the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra can be used as standalone computing devices, even if you don&apos;t take advantage of what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> has to offer.</p><p>These have essentially turned into Android versions of the Microsoft Surface Pro; detachable keyboards and all. While I&apos;m less of a fan of iPadOS now than I once was, it&apos;s definitely possible to be productive, even with a bit less flexibility than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> have to offer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This doesn&apos;t really take Amazon into account, as the majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire Tablets</a> are cheap enough to the point that they&apos;re more stocking stuffers than anything else. Well, at least that&apos;s the idea with the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is the company&apos;s lone non-Kindle premium tablet. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, there&apos;s <em>almost</em> no limit to what can be accomplished. Here are the different combinations that I could think of:</p>
<ul><li>Use the tablet as a tablet, without fiddling with "pro" features.</li><li>With the cellular model, take the Tab S10 Plus anywhere and get work done.</li><li>Use Samsung DeX and enjoy a more desktop-like experience, including being able to plug it into an external display. </li><li>If you own a Galaxy phone, tablet, and laptop, Multi Control lets you use a single keyboard and mouse to interact with your devices.</li><li>Second Screen turns the Galaxy Tab into an external display for any Windows computer.</li><li>With the included S Pen, the Galaxy Tab can transform into a drawing tablet or digital notebook.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;m sure if I thought about it longer, I could come up with even more things you can do with a flagship Galaxy Tab. But I think you get the idea.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve also been wondering why Samsung would opt to ditch the smaller 11-inch model of its flagship tablet lineup. If you&apos;ll notice, there is no base Galaxy Tab S10, just the Plus and Ultra. Just last year, the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab S9</a> finally gained an OLED display while offering decent battery life and top-shelf performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was something I really couldn&apos;t figure out until I looked at the other Galaxy Tabs that are currently available. I&apos;m not sure if Samsung will keep the Galaxy Tab S9 lineup around, but at the time of this writing, all three models can still be purchased. </p><p>Moving further down Samsung&apos;s price bracket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</a> and its 12.4-inch screen retail for $599, while the 10.9-inch Tab S9 FE is $449. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus rounds out the pack with an 11-inch display and a $319 price tag. </p><p>Admittedly, it does leave a rather large gap, seeing as the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus starts at $999. What I suspect is that the Galaxy Tab S9 will remain in the lineup, offering an option to those who want the best performance in a smaller form factor. But if you want the latest and the greatest, then you&apos;re probably okay with paying more and getting larger screens. </p>

<p>While I&apos;ve been primarily focusing on Samsung tablets, the reality is that there are definitely more options to choose from that don&apos;t just suck. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> was the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tablet, while the rather interesting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> is slated to be released in mid-October.</p><p>Lenovo has its own massive lineup of tablets to choose from, ranging from the Tab M8 for $99 and maxing out with the Tab Extreme at $1,099. Currently, there are nine different Lenovo tablets to choose from, coming in a variety of sizes and slotting in amongst the various price brackets. </p><p>This is to say that maybe the reason there&apos;s a resurgence in tablet sales has to do with the sheer number of solid options available. If you want to be productive, then there&apos;s the iPad Pro, Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-tab-extreme-will-challenge-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra" target="_blank">Lenovo Tab Extreme</a>. Need something on a budget but not at the bottom of a barrel? Well, you have an almost never-ending stream of options. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP" name="google-pixel-tablet-home-assistant-dashboard.jpg" alt="Home Assistant Dashboard on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon manages to straddle a few categories of its own, such as turning a Fire Tab into an Alexa smart display. While I do hope to see a refresh, you can either let the Pixel Tablet pull double duty as a smart home hub or use a regular Google tablet if you forgo the dock.</p><p>Regardless of the actual reason, if there is one, I&apos;m happy to see tablets getting a bit of the spotlight, especially when other categories of devices are slowing to a crawl. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-meta-connect-2024">yearly developer conference</a> and surprise — a big focus was placed on AI. It will be introducing features that resemble what we see from other tech companies with improved voice recognition, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">photo scanning</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">live translation</a> as some of the highlights.</p><p>It sounds a lot like what we see from Google. It&apos;s also the same potential privacy nightmare and abuse of consumer data that applies to the same tools from Google. And it will be presented the very same way through the terms of service you are forced to agree with to use the products.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">said this over and over</a> and others have, too. You have to read the things you&apos;re agreeing to. Especially this time.</p><p>I&apos;m not a fan of big tech or its fascination with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">intrusive AI</a>. Amazon, Google, Apple, OpenAI, and the rest have their best interests in mind and try to provide services you want to use so they can profit from the user data you supply. That&apos;s why features are presented the way they are and try to entice you into using them.</p>
<p>That&apos;s fine if there&apos;s mutual benefit, and only you get to decide that. I always use myself as an example; I use Google&apos;s products and services.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I hate the amount of data Google collects and don&apos;t like everything the company does with it. In return, I get to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">products I find useful</a>. I&apos;d much rather pay real money to use these products and skip the excessive data collection, but that&apos;s not an option. I opt out of anything that doesn&apos;t interest me and begrudgingly allow the rest because I benefit.</p><p>Plenty of folks don&apos;t feel this way and try not to use Google&apos;s products, and I don&apos;t use Amazon&apos;s (for example) because the benefits aren&apos;t there for me. Nobody is right or wrong here because we each get to decide for ourselves.</p>
<p>You have to make an informed decision, though. It&apos;s foolish to think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-cant-trust-facebook">a company like Meta</a> has developed and released these features for free out of kindness or philopatry. Meta may not want to harm society, but it cares most about how the company itself will benefit.</p><p>No company will risk stealing user data and abusing it without permission. Even when done inadvertently there are often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">brutal punishments</a> doled out by the courts for breach of trust issues. And there should be. Everything Meta collects and everything it does with it once collected is written in the terms and conditions for you to read. If you agree, you have given your blessing.</p>
<p>The one thing here that&apos;s a little different is the language used in those terms. To their credit, Google and Apple use language that&apos;s easy to understand when it comes to company policy, and Microsoft is getting there. We should remember that when we decide what tech ecosystem to buy into. I know I do because this means a lot and promotes a level of trust.</p><p>Meta is not on this list. Meta has a bad habit of writing difficult-to-understand policy documents and hiding them behind links to other documents. Long-time users of Meta products like Facebook will also remember how any updates reset all your privacy features. To return them to work the way you wanted meant you needed to go through them page by page. The company was hoping you wouldn&apos;t bother.</p>
<p>I&apos;m sure that Meta understands what this looks like to consumers. I&apos;m equally sure the company doesn&apos;t care because it knows almost everyone will click or tap the button that says "I agree" and allow them to do whatever they like.</p><p>I&apos;m saying you shouldn&apos;t. The articles you read about how bad Meta&apos;s AI features are from a privacy perspective often leave this important detail out. They&apos;re only bad if you want them to be, just like Google&apos;s, Apple&apos;s, or Amazon&apos;s.</p>

<p>At first glance, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus looks like it's going to be another great premium tablet effort from Samsung, following in the footsteps of the S9 series. For those who pre-order the Plus variant, Samsung is offering up to $700 off with an eligible device trade-in, which is a good deal for those who have such a device. You can also get an extra 50% off on the keyboard book cover when you bundle it with the S10 Plus.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a Samsung Galaxy tablet that comes with the S Pen; you want the latest in premium-level tablets but don&apos;t mind going with the Plus instead of the Ultra, to save a few bucks; you have other tablets, phones, or computers that are in good enough shape to trade them in.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather save money on a previous-generation or A series Galaxy Tab; you have extra money to spend and want the larger screen on the Ultra; you prefer Pixel or other brand tablets to those from the Samsung Galaxy lineup.</p><p>We reported on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">leaked Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra</a> last month, as well as the long-held speculation that Samsung might be dropping its base-level configuration. Now, speculation has become a reality with the launch of pre-orders, which now only include the Plus and Ultra, as expected. Samsung is also pushing its AI features, and it&apos;s worth noting that the S10 Plus and Ultra both come with the S Pen again.</p><p>On the hardware side, the S10 Plus is fairly similar, though Samsung has switched to the slightly-faster MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus Octa Core processor over the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 included with the S9 models. Otherwise, the microSD slot can now support expandable storage of up to 1.5TB instead of just 1TB.</p><p>Aesthetically, it&apos;s also pretty much the same size and design as the S9 Plus, with the exception of the launch of two slightly different colors: moonstone gray and platinum silver.</p><p>All in all, this might be a pick worth considering if you have something to trade in, or if you don&apos;t mind pre-ordering it outright.</p>

<hr>
<p>All eyes were on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S</a> at Meta Connect 2024, but a new way to wear the Meta Quest 3 has the potential to be one of the biggest drops of the conference. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-3-open-facial-interface/" target="_blank">announced</a> it is selling an official "open facial interface" for the Quest 3, which will give it an open-periphery experience similar to that of the Meta Quest Pro. When the Quest Pro is soon discontinued, the Quest 3 plus the open facial interface will be the official way to comfortably enjoy a Meta headset with open sides. </p><p>The open facial interface costs $40, and can be pre-ordered from Meta&apos;s website. If you order now, the estimated ship date is currently set for mid-October. Unfortunately, the open facial interface is only compatible with the Quest 3, not the new Quest 3S. The cheaper Quest 3S does have a "breathable facial interface" available, but the open design of the new Quest 3 facial interface could&apos;ve given users the illusion of a wider field-of-view. </p><p>Now, there are three official ways to wear the Meta Quest 3. There&apos;s the default facial interface that comes in the box with the Quest 3, which is designed for everyday use. Then, you have the silicone facial interface sold separately for $40, made for workouts and high-activity games. The new entrant into the lineup is the open facial interface, which Meta says is best for spatial experiences. For what it&apos;s worth, the open facial interface is also the lightest of the trio, weighing just 60 grams. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2eHtsyGgoTNFd3TSaDWqvB" name="Meta-Open-Facial-Interface-3.jpg" alt="The open facial interface for the Meta Quest 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eHtsyGgoTNFd3TSaDWqvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central&apos;s own Nick Sutrich tried the new open facial interface at Meta Connect, and recounted that it completely eliminated lens fogging issues. Additionally, it gave the feel of an open periphery, yet it didn&apos;t quite match the Quest Pro experience. The open sides of the Quest Pro leave nothing touching your face, but there is facial padding on the open facial interface for the Meta Quest 3. </p><p>Interestingly, the breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S also eliminated lens fogging. It doesn&apos;t provide the same level of open periphery as the open facial interface, since it&apos;s fully enclosed. However, since the breathable fabric does allow for some light to come through, it gives the wearer a sense of soft periphery. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-breathable-facial-interface-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the new breathable facial interface for the Meta Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rem2vuhUaTRgFPekLjg9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These new ways to wear the Meta Quest 3, and the more affordable Quest 3S, will be crucial as we head into the next year. The 128GB Quest 3 and the Quest Pro are set to be discontinued, so the 512GB Quest 3 plus the open facial interface will be the official way to get open periphery during spatial experiences moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-facial-interface-will-enable-better-mixed-reality-experiences-2">The open facial interface will enable better mixed-reality experiences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7An72xHvYiHsAZzhEXkwe9" name="Meta-Open-Facial-Interface-2.jpg" alt="The open facial interface for the Meta Quest 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7An72xHvYiHsAZzhEXkwe9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta&apos;s approach to designing the open facial interface tries to blend the best of open periphery and enclosed fabric seals. Third-party solutions already exist to help Meta Quest 3 owners use their headset without a facial interface, but Meta&apos;s intention is to give users the comfort and stability of a facial interface while providing  open side views. Again, it&apos;s not quite like the Meta Quest Pro, although the idea is similar. </p><p>It&apos;s impossible to compare the Meta Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro headsets, and yet it&apos;s clear that the latter and visionOS are impacting the former. Meta is trying out and pushing spatial experiences on the Quest 3 more since Vision Pro was released. As Apple Vision Pro owners have learned, spatial experiences that use mixed reality or simply passthrough video are better with open periphery. Where the displays end, your peripheral vision begins. </p><p>So, for those that like to use their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> for spatial computing or mixed-reality experiences, the $40 open facial interface could be a game-changer. There will surely be people who are still interested in using their Quest 3 without a facial interface at all, but Meta is offering a best-of-both-worlds solution. You can eliminate lens fogging and view your surroundings with the open facial interface and preserve comfort at the same time. </p><p>Even with the open facial interface, Meta will still be leaving a hole in its virtual reality lineup when the Quest Pro is discontinued. It wasn&apos;t a success by any means, but its open feel did make for a one-of-a-kind experience. For now, the $40 open facial interface and the $500 Meta Quest 3 will have to do. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s two past-gen Pixel Watches have encountered unsightly problems following the Wear OS 5 update. Due to this, the company has reportedly paused its major software update for the original Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2. Google confirmed as much to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/27/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-pulled/">9to5Google</a> today (Sept 27). According to the post, the company says the software update has bricked some users&apos; devices.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told the publication, "...in the meantime, we have paused the WearOS 5 rollout and are actively working on a resolution."</p><p>We&apos;ve heard reports of these, courtesy of members from the Android Central forums. One user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update#:~:text=FROM%20THE%20FORUMS-,goombah88,-I%20just%20got">goombah88</a>, stated, "I just got the update and it bricked my PW2. I have a black screen with a Bluetooth symbol at the bottom with a line through it." The user continued, saying they lost swiping functionality and that long-pressing the crown to reboot/shutdown didn&apos;t help.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update#:~:text=REPLY-,SeeBeeEss,-goombah88%20said%3A">follow-up comment</a> from another user states their O.G. Pixel Watch took roughly four hours to complete the Wear OS 5 update from Tuesday (Sept 24). It doesn&apos;t seem as though their device locked up following the patch, which is something 9to5 stated, as well.</p><p>Not every device suffers from this problem; however, its existence for some is enough cause for concern.</p><p>While Google toils away at a potential fix for the Wear OS 5 issue, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/wear-os-5-pixel-watch-issues/">publication cited</a> a Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13575675">support page</a> for fixing a "blank or frozen" Pixel Watch. This <em>should </em>relieve your device from any software-based problems. If it doesn&apos;t, Google&apos;s support line is your next course of action.</p>

<p>This development over the past three days is unfortunate considering past-gen Pixel Watch users have been waiting for Wear OS 5 all year. Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">the update on September 24</a>, which included the monthly security patch. It was a major patch for devices rocking OS 3.5 or OS 4 and fixed numerous bugs across the past-gen devices.</p><p>More importantly, Wear OS 5 was the star of the major update. Google teased that there were "new features," but it didn&apos;t specify. The post alerted us to updates to the grid-view app launcher, camera controls, and Pixel Recorder functionality.</p><p>Originally, the Wear OS 5 update was supposed to continue hitting watches over the next week. However, with what&apos;s currently plaguing devices, that&apos;s not happening anymore. We can only hope that Google figures out the issue and solves it quickly. Right now, Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2 owners attempting to update their devices will find nothing available.</p>
