<ul><li>Reports indicate that Chick-Fil-A, the fast-food chain known for its chicken sandwiches, is breaking into entertainment "aggressively."</li><li>The company is reportedly working with major production companies to create new shows, acquire the rights to existing content, and host the media on its own streaming service.</li><li>It might seem odd that Chick-Fil-A is starting its own streaming service, but it's hardly the first non-tech company to enter the technology industry.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Many years ago, cable and satellite TV customers flocked to streaming services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix">Netflix </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon">Amazon Prime</a>, leaving their set-top boxes and expensive contracts behind. For a time, the streaming landscape was indeed better than cable. That isn&apos;t true anymore, because the streaming market has been flooded with too many options and anti-consumer media licensing battles. </p><p>If you&apos;re tired of streaming services, be prepared to start seeing a brand new one: Chick-Fil-A wants you to get your fast-food fill and your original video content from the same company. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/chick-fil-a-hatches-streaming-service-1236044196/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reported last week that Chick-Fil-A is trying to shore up original content ahead of the launch of its rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv">streaming service</a>. The fast food chain is reportedly working with multiple major production companies and studios to develop unscripted, game-show-style TV shows. </p><p>While much of the content is said to be unscripted, some scripted content could be in the works. Deadline also says that Chick-Fil-A is having conversations about licensing and acquiring the rights to existing content, which would then be hosted on this new streaming service. Specifically, the outlet says that a family-friendly gameshow has already received a ten-episode order from Chick-Fil-A. </p><p>It might seem surprising that Chick-Fil-A is breaking into the video streaming market, but who isn&apos;t these days? We&apos;ve already seen shows from Lyft, Airbnb, and others. While fast food chains haven&apos;t been known to foray into streaming services, they&apos;re exploring the technology industry as much as any other company. Mobile ordering, data collection, and automation have been hot topics in the fast food industry in recent years. </p><p>The real question to ask is this one: do we really <em>need</em> a Chick-Fil-A streaming service? For 99% of people, I suspect the answer is decidedly no. We already have too many streaming services, and the content many of us enjoy is already scattered across multiple video platforms. In fact, I&apos;d reason that there are many more people laughing about this development from Chick-Fil-A than there are excited about it. </p><p>It&apos;s no joke when companies with barely any tech experience jump into the industry. It can lead to serious problems, and we&apos;ve already seen some of those issues pop up.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UoGCi6MUR4WRFuxRTcmwx5" name="disney-plus-app-logo-on-tv.jpg" alt="The Disney Plus TV app and logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UoGCi6MUR4WRFuxRTcmwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For starters, the amount of bandwidth and servers needed to service a video streaming platform is more than you&apos;d expect unless you&apos;ve tried to do it. It&apos;s likely that Chick-Fil-A is underestimating the technical infrastructure required to host a streaming service, even if it&apos;s outsourcing most of it. Plus, all the investments Deadline is reporting now are being made for original content and licensing deals, not the service itself. </p><p>The more concerning thing to me is the security of Chick-Fil-A&apos;s platform. Historically, companies that aren&apos;t tech-first tend to leave user data vulnerable to hackers and data breaches. For example, in early 2024, McDonald&apos;s suffered a major data breach that leaked customer and employee names, emails, internal tools, and bank logs, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thecyberexpress.com/mcdonalds-data-breach-surfaces-on-dark-web/" target="_blank">The Cyber Express</a>. While Chick-Fil-A already stores user data related to its mobile app, a streaming service increases the likelihood that credit card and payment information will be saved and is potentially at risk. </p><p>No company is immune from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/atandt-data-breach-compromised-phone-records-of-nearly-all-its-customers">data breaches</a>. However, when you trust a company like Apple or Google with your personal data, you know they&apos;ve been doing this for decades and will take measures to protect your information. You might share data with the Apples and Googles of the world that you wouldn&apos;t with a startup. </p><p>The problem with Chick-Fil-A, and companies like it, entering the tech space is simple. You trust the brand and are familiar with it because you&apos;ve seen it before or you&apos;ve been a customer, but in reality, Chick-Fil-A is no better than a startup in the tech space. The experience of making fast food doesn&apos;t transfer to hosting user accounts, credit card information, or video streaming. </p><p>Disney+ introduced a whole new cause for concern, too. Disney originally tried to have a wrongful death lawsuit tossed out of court because the plaintiff signed up for a Disney+ free trial and agreed to an arbitration clause. The company argued that this clause applied to Disney Springs restaurants completely unrelated to Disney+. As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/disney-allergy-death-lawsuit-b66cd07c6be2497bf5f6bce2d1f2e8d1" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> reports, Disney backed down in response to public pressure. But it leaves us wondering: would it have worked? By agreeing to terms and conditions for a Chick-Fil-A streaming service, could those be used against us while eating a chicken sandwich?</p><p>We have no idea how Chick-Fil-A would operate a streaming service. I&apos;ve brought up prior examples of what can happen when you trust a company without major experience in tech with your data, and these are worth considering. The next time a trusted brand throws their hat in the ring when it comes to technology, think twice before you trust it. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest beta version of Google Play services hints at a drag-and-drop feature for Quick Share, similar to what’s already available on Windows.</li><li>Currently, Quick Share doesn’t support drag-and-drop on larger Android devices like tablets and foldables.</li><li>The feature was showcased in a demo, but it's still in development and files aren’t transferring yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s Quick Share, the Android version of Apple&apos;s AirDrop, is set to get a big upgrade that could make sharing files on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> a lot easier.</p><p>Recent insights from the beta version of Google Play services, courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/drag-drop-quick-share-tablets-3474976/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, hint at a new drag-and-drop feature coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Quick Share on Android</a>. It looks like it’ll work much like the current Quick Share experience on Windows.</p><p>Although Google&apos;s Quick Share has made it easier to transfer files between devices, it doesn&apos;t work the same across all platforms. While you can drag and drop files on Windows with Quick Share, this handy capability is still missing on larger Android devices like tablets and foldables.</p><p>But an APK teardown of the latest Google Play Services beta (24.34.32) shows that Google is working on adding drag-and-drop capability to Quick Share.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Quick Share is a handy app that makes it easy to transfer files between devices wirelessly. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">works across Android phones, tablets, Chromebooks, and Windows PCs</a>, offering a great option for those who don’t use Apple products.</p><p>But people using tablets and foldable devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/how-to-drag-and-drop-between-apps-on-android-tablets">currently have to go through a few steps to share files on Android</a>—selecting the files, tapping the Share button, and then choosing from the sharesheet, which includes Quick Share among other options. So, adding a simple drag-and-drop gesture would make file sharing on larger screens much easier and more intuitive.</p><p>More importantly, the upcoming drag-and-drop capability will help close the gap between Android and Windows, giving Android users a level of ease similar to what Windows users enjoy.</p><p>While Android Authority got the feature up and running and gave a demo of what it can do, it&apos;s not fully operational yet. The video shows that users can drag multiple files to the recipient&apos;s name, but the files aren’t actually transferring at this stage.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 series quietly added "Adaptive Touch," which makes it more responsive with wet fingers or screens, even though Google didn’t mention it during the launch event.</li><li>You’ll find a new Adaptive Touch option in the Display settings that adjusts touch sensitivity based on your environment and whether you have a screen protector.</li><li>Adaptive Touch is enabled by default on the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series has quietly picked up "Adaptive Touch," a handy feature that improves responsiveness with wet fingers or screen protectors. This detail emerged after the launch, despite Google not highlighting it during the event.</p><p>As reported by Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-adaptive-touch-feature-3474994/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, there&apos;s a new Adaptive Touch option in the Display settings. When you turn it on, it automatically tweaks your device’s touch sensitivity depending on your surroundings, how you&apos;re using it, and if there&apos;s a screen protector in the mix.</p><p>Even though Google didn’t officially announce it, it’s not surprising that Adaptive Touch didn’t come up at the Made by Google 2024 event for the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>The feature is now confirmed to be enabled by default on the Pixel 9, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-could-bring-adaptive-touch-feature">rumored back in March</a>, but it’s officially here, especially handy when your fingers are wet.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="akTTJ3wuxkiWJoJgx88mKm" name="google-pixel-9-adaptive-touch.jpg" alt="Adaptive touch option in the Pixel 9's display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akTTJ3wuxkiWJoJgx88mKm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:337px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.55%;"><img id="wRBFaePpzEoTxyyvko4RBm" name="google-pixel-9-adaptive-touch-toggle.jpg" alt="Adaptive touch option in the Pixel 9's display settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wRBFaePpzEoTxyyvko4RBm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="337" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>It&apos;s perhaps worth noting that the screen protector mode toggle is still available, probably for those who prefer to manually handle screen protector detection instead of using Adaptive Touch.</p><p>Side-by-side tests reveal a big contrast between the Pixel 9 with Adaptive Touch and the older Pixel 8 Pro. In Android Authority&apos;s video, the Pixel 9 nails touch sensitivity, even with wet fingers, while the Pixel 8 Pro without the feature has issues with erratic screen jumps and zooming.</p>

<p>Adaptive Touch comes pre-enabled on the Pixel 9, so you’re all set from the get-go. While it’s hard to see why you’d want to turn it off, you can still find the option in the settings if you change your mind.</p><p>The Pixel 9 launch event was short and heavily focused on AI, which probably meant there wasn’t time to cover every cool feature of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> from Google. Still, the advanced AI tech definitely boosts the appeal of the Pixel 9 series.</p>

<h2 id="update-parity-with-the-pixel-9-series-2">Update parity with the Pixel 9 series</h2>
<p>Google’s latest folding phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> looks a bit like a parts bin special from the spec sheet with the same Tensor G4 SoC and 16GB of RAM as the Pixel 9 Pro, but that&apos;s far from a bad thing. While the previous Pixel Fold came with the aging Tensor G2 and 12GB of RAM, this new Fold is in line with the latest Pixel 9 Pro generation and is set to receive the same number of software updates with seven years of support.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold will receive security updates as well as the latest version of Android until August of 2031. That means your phone will not only remain secure for years to come, but you’ll be able to try out the latest builds of Android so you won’t be missing out on too many features. With hardware that matches the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in terms of power, this phone should be able to keep up with your needs for as long as, and perhaps longer than you will want to keep your Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>If you were considering the last generation Pixel Fold, keep in mind that Google has only committed to five years of updates for that device, so it will stop receiving Android updates in June 2026 and security updates in June 2028. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold">Comparing the two folding Pixel phones</a>, the newer version is the way to go. And that’s before you consider all of the other hardware improvements like better displays, a faster SoC, more RAM, and better Wi-Fi.</p><p>It&apos;s a very real possibility that your Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be damaged before it stops getting updates, so it&apos;s a good idea to protect it with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">best Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases.</a> While it&apos;s water resis</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 Pro may be a year old, but it still rules over most when it comes to taking photos. Plus, Tensor brings tons of fun AI features and long software support. There's also a nice Bay blue colorway that's hard to ignore, and your Pixel will still get many new features before other Android phones.</p></p>

<p>Google&apos;s new Pixel 9 series has arrived, and with it comes a new Pixel 9 Pro XL, the larger of the two Pro models. Technically, it&apos;s a more direct successor to the Pixel 8 Pro, which features a much larger display than the Pixel 8, but the "XL" adds a new dimension to the moniker, letting users know that they have a choice.</p><p>We&apos;ve had brief hands-on time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL and still need to spend more time with it before we have a full picture of it. So far, it looks like it could be the phone to get if you want a larger flagship, or you can potentially save some money and go for the older, extremely capable Pixel 8 Pro. Our Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro comparison should help you choose if you&apos;re having a hard time deciding.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="An Obsidian and Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After years of sticking with largely the same design for the Pixel series, Google is finally changing things up with what can only be described as an evolution of its previous Pixel design language. The iconic camera bar present on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> is gone, replaced by a floating camera visor that certainly stands out among the rest of the Pixel 9 Pro XL design. This is perhaps the most obvious difference between these two phones, but it doesn&apos;t stop there.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has adopted an iPhone-like design with a flat front and back panel and a flat frame. If it weren&apos;t for the camera visor and the lack of a Dynamic Island on the front, you could almost mistake this for an iPhone. This is contrasted by the softer, less angular design of the Pixel 8 Pro, with a matte glass back panel that curves into the slightly rounded frame. Even the display, which is flat on the 8 Pro, has the smallest curve on the bezel where it meets the frame, and the camera bar also curves up from the frame as if the two are a singular piece.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8TGbvkby2dCXjrvpZE6HAh" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-05-camera-bars.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8TGbvkby2dCXjrvpZE6HAh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones look great in their own way, although it&apos;s unclear how the Pixel 9 Pro XL design will be received, especially once consumers get it in hand. Some consumers find that flat, angular phones tend to be a bit painful to hold as they dig into their fingers when held with one hand, and the curved Pixel 8 Pro is fairly comfortable to hold. There is a slight curve to the frame, so hopefully that will alleviate any concerns.</p><p>Both phones are also large, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL sporting a slightly bigger 6.8-inch display. Despite that, the phones have roughly the same height and width, although the 9 Pro XL is a bit heavier at 221g. But aside from the slight increase in size, there&apos;s not much difference between the two displays. The Pixel 9 Pro XL features the same resolution and refresh rate but kicks things up with higher peak brightness at 3,000 nits, meaning you should have no trouble viewing this display outdoors.</p>

<p>For protection, both phones feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> on the front and back and IP68 water and dust resistance. The back glass is also matte on both phones, which should provide a softer touch, although you&apos;ll find some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-9-pro-or-xl-should-you-buy">newer colors with the Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>Google offers Obsidian and Porcelain hues for both phones, as well as some form of green. However, instead of blue, the Pixel 9 Pro comes in a pink Rose Quarts hue, which stands out among the other options.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Obsidian" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has upgraded the Pixel 9 Pro XL with a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Tensor G4</a> chipset, which offers a 20% performance boost when browsing and is 17% faster when opening apps when compared to its predecessor. How this really translates in real-life use is still yet to be determined, but the focus remains clear: AI performance. Thus, Google is enabling tons of new features with the chip, which we&apos;ll discuss in the next section.</p><p>In addition to the chip boost, Google has also upped the RAM to 16, meaning the Pixel 9 Pro should be able to handle more tasks. The 12GB features on the Pixel 8 Pro is great for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, but 16GB gives the phone much more room for activities.</p>

<p>One benefit of the new chip is support for satellite connectivity, something we&apos;ve seen on the iPhone and have been waiting to see more widely available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. We could see this appear on the Pixel 8 Pro at some point, as they should also be able to support it, but the newer Exynos modem in the Pixel 9 Pro mentions satellite connectivity as a highlight feature.</p><p>You also get Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and UWB on both devices. It&apos;s also worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro XL now uses an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which should be more accurate than its predecessor.</p><p>Interestingly, the battery inside the Pixel 9 Pro grew ever-so-slightly, up to 5060mAh from 5050mAh. However, the big change here is the charging speed, which has been increased by 7W. Google says that a 30-minute charge with its 45W charger should give you about 70% battery life, which is a <em>huge</em> jump. The Pixel 8 Pro can only reach 50% in the same amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg" name="google-pixel-9-pro-vs-pixel-8-pro-porcelain-04-camera-bars.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/548bAmXmYXau2FSmft9evg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 Pro offers impressive cameras, and it&apos;s hard to argue with Google&apos;s excellent computational photography. The Pixel 9 Pro XL camera setup isn&apos;t a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but there are some notable changes.</p><p>The 50MP sensor is pretty much identical, which is fine. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review" target="_blank">Pro&apos;s camera produces amazing photos</a> with plenty of depth and contrast while not being too over the top. It also takes fantastic low-light and nighttime images, so I expect the same from the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<p>Google outfitted the Pixel 9 Pro XL with a new 48MP ultrawide sensor, featuring a wider f/1.7 aperture, meaning it should take better low-light photos than the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s ultrawide camera. However, the tradeoff is a slightly narrower field of view at 123-degrees, compared to 125-degrees on the 9 Pro. The telephoto sensor has changed slightly but still features the same 30X Super Res Zoom.</p><p>Selfies should get a boost, with a new 42MP sensor. This will likely use pixel-binning to take 10.5MP images, the same resolution as the Pixel 8 Pro, but this could also result in sharper images and better low-light capabilities. It also has a wider field of view, which makes it better for group selfies.</p>
<p>Like the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is capable of 4K video recording but gets a literal boost thanks to Super Res Video Zoom, which appears to enhance quality when zoomed in. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a> feature also gets upgraded and upscales video to 8K resolution. It&apos;s admittedly a cool feature, and we&apos;ll have to try it out for ourselves, although it remains to be seen how useful 8K videos will be on such a small screen. However, that&apos;s not the only cool software improvement aimed at improving your camera experience...</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is likely right around the corner. Even so, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a few extra software goodies that the Pixel 8 Pro doesn&apos;t yet have or might not even get. The 8K video is one such feature, but there are a handful of cool AI-powered features that Google is touting with the 9 Pro XL. Among them is the Add Me feature, which lets you take a photo and then you can add yourself to that same image thanks to an augmented reality overlay.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> also gets some new upgrades, with new Reimagine and Auto Frame features, letting users easily alter aspects of the image to their liking or better frame a photo.</p><p>But besides camera features, Google is also adding some other helpful AI goodies, such as Gemini Live, which lets you have a more natural conversation with the assistant chatbot, and Pixel Studio, which lets you create images from text prompts. Pixel Screenshots and Pixel Weather are also new on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which bring new AI enhancements to your screenshots with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature and to your weather forecasts.</p>

<p>It&apos;s quite likely many of these features will arrive on the Pixel 8 Pro, but it&apos;s clear they were built with the Tensor G4 in mind, meaning you&apos;ll get the best performance from the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which also has more RAM.</p><p>Otherwise, both phones will receive the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">7-year update promise</a>, although the Pixel 8 Pro is already a year into its software lifespan, so the Pixel 9 Pro XL may be your phone if you want that added longevity.</p>

<p>These are two top-of-the-line Pixel phones that will get you access to some of the most advanced AI features Google has to offer. The Pixel 8 Pro is one of the best there is, and it&apos;s still a fantastic choice if you&apos;re looking for a bigger phone with more cameras and more AI. Of course, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has improved on some of that with its better Tensor chipset, faster charging speeds, enhanced cameras, and new AI features.</p><p>It really comes down to design and support. The first is subjective, so it&apos;s not really cut-and-dry which phone has the better design, and it&apos;s up to your personal taste. Support on the 9 Pro XL will technically last you an additional year since it&apos;s the newer phone, but support on both still outpaces many devices on the market.</p><p>The only thing is that not all the new AI features may trickle down to the Pixel 8 Pro, and we&apos;ll have to see what makes it down the line. But if you&apos;re not too worried about that, then you really can&apos;t go wrong with either option, and the Pixel 8 Pro will at least save you a little money.</p><p>And if you want something smaller but just as powerful, you can check out our Pixel 9 Pro vs. Pixel 8 Pro comparison.</p>

<p>Heart rate monitor chest straps earn their reputation as the gold standard for workout accuracy. When it works as intended, my Polar H10 ECG delivers precise, quick-adapting results, and I&apos;ve used it for many reviews and accuracy tests against smartwatches to see how good their optical sensors are. </p><p>Despite all that, I&apos;m ready to move on from chest straps, both professionally and personally.</p><p>My thoughts on this coalesced when I performed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">Galaxy Watch Ultra accuracy test</a>. Samsung promised a revamped optical sensor that would prevent light artifact issues during anaerobic workouts, so I tested the results against my COROS Heart Rate Monitor, an optical HR armband. </p><p>Someone reposted the article on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/1e38o47/the_galaxy_watch_ultra_mostly_lives_up_to/?rdt=42005">r/GalaxyWatch on Reddit</a>, and the responses ranged from calling the test "kinda pointless" because I didn&apos;t use a chest strap to "Trusting Android Central to do a fitness device review?  lol." To paraphrase my childhood hero, Michael Jordan, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/2t4RVg_Yq2g">I took it personally</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-people-trust-chest-strap-heart-rates-and-don-apos-t-trust-ohrs-2">Why people trust chest strap heart rates (and don&apos;t trust OHRs)</h2>
<p>There&apos;s a widespread assumption that optical heart rate (OHR) straps can&apos;t be trusted, and journalists who use them for testing are wasting people&apos;s time. It&apos;s a reasonable belief but one that needs to be debunked. </p><p>Any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or tracker, smart ring, or armband uses LEDs to illuminate your skin and photodiodes to catch the reflected light, visually tracking changes in your pulse. It&apos;s generally reliable but prone to errors if the PPG sensors aren&apos;t perfectly flush; arm movement introduces gaps that let in light and sweat that skew the results.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> add more LEDs and new algorithms to try and solve the light artifact issue. Samsung and Google have a bad track record at supporting external heart rate monitors, so I do at least appreciate the effort, even if early tests suggest they have more work to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DB8YUoN9BTZYv8vEMZL3XC" name="Polar-H10-heart-rate-monitor-chest-strap.jpeg" alt="The Polar H10 and its electrode-covered strap sitting on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DB8YUoN9BTZYv8vEMZL3XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A chest strap bypasses these LED issues. It uses an electrocardiograph (ECG) to read your heart muscle&apos;s electrical rhythm at its source instead of further out, where changes in blood flow might take longer to register.</p><p>Since OHRs can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9662769/">struggle with accuracy on darker skin tones</a> — some brands address this issue better than others — many athletes only trust chest straps.</p><p>That isn&apos;t to say a chest strap magically gives you perfect results every time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.polar.com/us-en/support/FAQs/Abnormal_Heart_Rate_Readings_During_Exercise">According to Polar</a>, you must moisten the Polar H10&apos;s electrodes with water, gels, or saliva (<em>ew</em>) before sweat kicks in and improves the connection. Chest hair can block the signal, as can static from a synthetic shirt or other electrical sources. And you&apos;ll need a tight enough strap to maintain the connection.</p><p>But beyond that, they&apos;re also uncomfortable! I&apos;m happy for people who&apos;ve Stockholm Syndromed themselves into getting used to chest straps&apos; fit, but the restrictive feeling keeps me out of my running "zone." I put up with it (until now) because I wanted to give readers accurate testing results.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-apos-m-using-an-ohr-arm-band-for-testing-accuracy-2">Why I&apos;m using an OHR arm band for testing accuracy</h2>

<p>An OHR armband properly fitted to your biceps avoids a wrist-based sensor&apos;s issues. You have much more surface area for LEDs to read your pulse, it&apos;s more comfortable to secure tightly, and there&apos;s no bending joint to cause accidental separation during exercises like push-ups.</p><p>I received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> for a review, and it delivered accurate results. I gifted another COROS band to my partner, who&apos;s had trouble with wrist-based OHR in the past due to skin tone, and she hasn&apos;t experienced the same issues with the arm-based strap so far.</p><p>At the time, I read the general consensus on chest straps&apos; supremacy and bought a Polar H10 to compare the two. Both gave me near-identical results, but I decided to use the H10 for my smartwatch reviews since it was supposedly better.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if my H10 is a bit defective, if I&apos;m not wetting the electrodes enough, or maybe the strap isn&apos;t perfectly fitted. But the more I use it, the more I get obvious inaccuracies during the first 10–15 minutes of a workout.</p><p>I first noticed this during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">Garmin Forerunner 165 track test</a> in March, when the H10 HR briefly dipped from 152 to 138 bpm and stayed flat while my Garmin, Coros, and Fitbit all rose to 166 bpm. But it was just one blip (I thought).</p><p>Then, during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Coros vs. Garmin vs. Polar watch accuracy test</a>, I spotted a few moments during a normal run <em>and</em> a track workout where it spiked well above or below all three watches before auto-correcting to its usual perfection, without any adjustments on my end. It made judging the "best" watch OHR harder when my ECG control group was wonky.</p>

<p>After those Redditors decided to come for me, I performed a straightforward COROS HRM vs. Polar H10 test, pairing the COROS to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and starting a workout in the Polar Beat app simultaneously; you can see the results in the charts above (a 10K run) and below (a hard 1-mile track run).</p><p>I knew something was off during my first run, even with my phone in my pocket, because Polar Beat kept alternating audio cues for "improving fitness" and "burning fat," as if I was rapidly changing my heart rate and pace. It was simply losing and recapturing my actual heart rate signal before things settled down, and it remained perfect for 30+ minutes — without any physical adjustment on my part.</p><p>During the second test the same day, the H10 immediately claimed that I was at near-max effort before I&apos;d even hit a fast pace, then fluctuated slightly between too high and too low before nailing my heart rate a few minutes in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.66%;"><img id="shDRNyhCVSo4HMsc65nUqK" name="Polar-H10-vs-Coros-Heart-Rate-Monitor-track-test.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the Polar H10 and COROS Heart Rate Monitor compare for accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shDRNyhCVSo4HMsc65nUqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2144" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Note: The "Garmin Forerunner 965" heart rate actually stems from the connected COROS HRM. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To forestall the inevitable comments, I&apos;m not claiming all chest straps are inaccurate. I&apos;m hopeful I can figure out why my H10 has early-run issues. What&apos;s more important is each graph&apos;s second half, where you&apos;ll find Polar and COROS in near-lockstep.</p><p>They&apos;re never perfectly aligned. In the first run, whenever I increased my pace or ran up a steep hill, COROS consistently trailed by about 1 bpm before catching up and took slightly longer to register when I eased off. During the second run, Polar registers tiny 1 bpm fluctuations that COROS needs longer to catch. </p><p>But even chest strap lovers must admit that COROS&apos; optical HR graph is on point. It catches up quickly and has fewer errors than wrist-based trackers.</p><p>Personally, the accuracy gap is so minimal — and the comfort gap so wide — that I&apos;d rather wear my OHR armband; even if it&apos;s not <em>perfect</em>, it&apos;s more than good enough for Garmin or other brands to calculate my general effort and training load. And it&apos;s much easier to forget I&apos;m wearing an armband than a chest strap.</p>

<p>Yes, chest strap heart rate readings are more accurate than an arm- or wrist-based optical sensor. Fitness experts like DC Rainmaker use chest straps as review benchmarks for a reason. If you prioritize accuracy over comfort, buy a chest strap.</p><p>But here&apos;s what matters: smartwatches are <em>always</em> going to use optical readings and they&apos;re <em>never</em> going to be as good as chest straps. </p><p>Why should I exclusively use a chest strap for accuracy tests when that&apos;s a quality standard that a watch can&apos;t reasonably hit? Smartwatch HR accuracy has demonstrably improved across brands in recent years, but if chest straps are the benchmark, then every watch I review is "inaccurate" to some degree. </p><p>You shouldn&apos;t read smartwatch reviews holding them to the standard of a chest-based ECG unless you&apos;re looking for things to criticize. Instead, a more useful comparison is how its optical HR matches against a COROS HRM or Polar Verity Sense, both of which negate the usual issues with OHRs like light artifacts. Very few fitness watches come close to that standard, but a few brands are using algorithms to try and close the gap.</p><p>It&apos;s not about perfection; it&apos;s about finding watches that are <em>good enough</em> for you to compromise and leave your chest strap at home.</p>

<ul><li>The main appeal of the Wireless Power Consortium's new Qi2 charging standard is the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP).</li><li>The MPP allows Qi2-equipped devices to connect with magnetic accessories, including those that support MagSafe, such as chargers, wallets, cases, and more.</li><li>However, it has been revealed that devices do <strong>not</strong> have to support the MPP to earn Qi2 certification, creating a confusing situation. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s rare that Apple basically gift wraps a proprietary technology to give to the entire industry like the company did when it gave MagSafe to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) for inclusion in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">the Qi2 specification</a>. I wonder what it thinks of that decision now that the WPC, Android device manufacturers, and accessory makers have seemingly botched what should&apos;ve been a monumental launch for Qi2.</p><p>We know that basically all devices that charge wirelessly use the Qi charging standard, excluding a few categories, like smartwatches. Qi2 is the next-generation wireless charging spec from the WPC, and it packs some exciting upgrades. The standard bumps the maximum wireless charging speed up from 7.5W to 15W and, more importantly, includes the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP). </p><p>Or so we thought. </p><p>The MPP can be viewed as an open-sourced version of Apple&apos;s proprietary magnetic connection system. That means that devices that support Qi2 and the MPP, by extension, could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones" target="_blank">connect to MagSafe chargers and other accessories</a>. Qi2 and the MPP have been talked about interchangeably in the lead-up to the standard&apos;s release. Since the WPC charges a lump sum to view the specification in its entirety — a fee to the tune of $18,000 — we all assumed that Qi2 <em>always</em> shipped with the MPP, but that isn&apos;t the case. </p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman points out that Qi2 and MPP are indeed separate in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1825607536747360703" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Previously, it was thought that a device or accessory needed to support the MPP to earn the Qi2 specification. However, Rahman&apos;s discovery confirms that devices and accessories may feature Qi2 branding due to their support of 15W wireless charging while lacking magnets. </p>

<p>Rahman links to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231115984149/en/Qi-v2.0-Standard-for-Wireless-Charging-Is-Now-Ready-to-Provide-Enhanced-User-Experience" target="_blank">press release</a> from the WPC that plainly states the way that Qi, Qi2 MPP, and Qi2 extended power profile (EPP) will be used going forward. Qi is the EPP standard we&apos;re used to, with up to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. Devices and accessories that use the Qi2 spec with the MPP included can utilize the fancy new Qi2 logo to signify its magnetic capabilities. According to the WPC, devices and accessories that meet the Qi2 requirements over the EPP will be "branded with the existing Qi logo consumers know and use today."</p><p>If this is how the WPC is handling the Qi2 rollout and certification process — the linked press release is from November 2023, and there is some uncertainty around whether things have changed since then — there are pros and cons to its approach. It&apos;s great to know that if you see that Qi2 logo with the ring around it, you can be sure that your device supports both Qi2 charging speeds and has magnets. However, the original Qi spec has become convoluted in the process since it could support either 7.5W or 15W charging speeds — and there&apos;s no way to know which by the logo.</p><p>Android Central reached out to the Wireless Power Consortium for clarification on the Qi2 certification requirements and the logos currently in use. We did not hear back in time for publication, but we&apos;ll update this article when we do. </p>

<p>As someone who has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/peak-design-android-magsafe-accessories">following MagSafe (and later Qi2) on Android</a> for years, I&apos;m utterly perplexed by this development. Why is the WPC letting manufacturers certify their devices for Qi2 without including magnets? It&apos;s utterly unnecessary. Yes, it&apos;s true that Qi2 is about more than just magnets, namely when you consider the 15W charging speed. However, the 7.5W limitation hasn&apos;t stopped companies from offering faster charging speeds in the past through their own means — just look at what OnePlus has done with fast charging on its phones.</p><p>If the reason for the WPC permitting Qi2 devices that use the EPP was because it couldn&apos;t let Qi-branded devices offer more than 7.5W, that doesn&apos;t really make sense either. Qi2 products without magnets are still forced to use the old Qi logo anyway, so what&apos;s the point? This didn&apos;t have to be confusing, and now it is. </p><p>Right now, the vast majority of Qi2-enabled products include the MPP and are thus MagSafe-compatible. If companies do the right thing and add magnets to Qi2 chargers and accessories, the fact that the spec doesn&apos;t explicitly require them will become a tiny asterisk in the history of what should be a great standard. However, we have little reason to think that companies will do the right thing. For some reason, we&apos;ve yet to see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">flagship Android phone</a> shipped with Qi2 support — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> is the only one to do so. </p><p>To put it simply, the rollout of Qi2 has been a mess so far. Google and Samsung both had numerous chances to add the standard to their smartphones, and they passed. We might&apos;ve given Samsung a pass when it launched the Galaxy S24 series in early 2024 and the Galaxy Z series this summer. But what&apos;s Google&apos;s excuse for not including it in the Google Pixel 9 lineup? </p><p>I don&apos;t know why more phones don&apos;t already feature Qi2, and I don&apos;t know why magnets aren&apos;t required. The whole point of Qi2 was to get the MagSafe experience on Android and other platforms, but no one really seems interested in making that a reality, at least not in 2024.</p>

<p>Google does this. You don&apos;t even need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">a Pixel 9</a> to create AI photos from your mind using Google because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s ImageFX is a thing</a> and it works on any and every smartphone that can use Google Chrome, which is all of them.</p><p>And forget Google for a minute. There are plenty of other companies with mobile-friendly websites that will let you do the same as Pixel Studio. I found several places online that would create a picture of a chicken committing an act of terrorism, and it only took a few minutes. No, I&apos;m not telling you where to find them. You can use Google or<del> as I did</del> Bing. They&apos;re not hard to find.</p><p>Fun fact: none of those places were Google because it won&apos;t create anything, chicken or otherwise, committing terrorism. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15236074?visit_id=638599394150771349-2108561604&p=pixel_studio_restrictions&rd=1#image-restrictions">has rules</a> its AI tools and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy">people using them</a> have to follow, and if you can find a way to make it break them, there are places you can report it so Google can try to fix it.</p><p>Remember, AI is dumb, not intelligent, so things will slip through the cracks. A Google spokesperson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224084/google-pixel-9-reimagine-ai-photos">told the Verge</a>, "At times, some prompts can challenge these tools’ guardrails, and we remain committed to continually enhancing and refining the safeguards we have in place."</p>
<p>I don&apos;t care about any of this. Shitty people with a shitty agenda will find a way to make shitty pictures and have been doing so for years and years. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-will-be-a-glorious-mess" target="_blank">AI is a dumpster fire,</a> but it&apos;s not some magical tool that makes these things possible; it simply lets people do them without spending five minutes learning a different way.</p><p>Use common sense and never believe something that seems unreal or stupid.

<p>What I do care about is all the pearl-clutching that happens whenever Google is involved. It&apos;s good to hate Google for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lawsuit-targets-chrome-privacy-sandbox">really dumb</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-antitrust-faq">evil things</a> it does, and we should hold it to a higher standard. Pretending that Google is at fault because bad people will do bad things is bad journalism, though.</p><p>You can use Bing or Duck Duck Go to find a website that works with your phone and do the same things Google&apos;s Magic Editor can do. You can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, or an iPhone. You can take Google completely out of the picture and get the very same kind of result, or an even worse result, because not every AI company has the same seemingly weak AI guardrails Google has in place.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-3-repair-lack-report"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> launched just a week ago, but we&apos;re still learning more important details about the smartwatch before it ships to consumers. Turns out, you might want to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-screen-protectors">screen protector for the Pixel Watch 3</a>, because Google&apos;s policy for broken models is that they will be replaced, not repaired.</p><p>A Google representative confirmed this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a>, stating that if you have a broken <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, you should check with "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>This isn&apos;t that much of a surprise, given this was essentially the policy for the Pixel Watch 2 and its predecessor. And while not exact reason was given, it&apos;s likely due to the way the watch was designed, which may make it difficult to repair.</p><p>Instead, Google recommends users enroll in its Preferred Care program, which covers damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." However, if you do end up needing to replace your watch, you&apos;ll have to fork over $49, and given the cost of the insurance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-no-repair-policy-should-not-surprise-you">you&apos;ll have to decide if it&apos;s worth it to you</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 3 is available for preorder now, so be sure to check out available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-best-google-pixel-watch-3-preorder-deals-how-to-buy-and-what-to-expect">preorder deals for the smartwatch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-camera-astrophotography-manual-control"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>One of the best features on Pixel phones just got a little better. Thanks to the latest update to the Pixel Camera app, you can now manually trigger Astrophotography mode to capture pictures of the night sky.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> needed to be activated automatically by keeping the phone still and waiting for the mode to appear. Once the moon icon appeared on the shutter button, you were then able to activate the mode.</p><p>Now, users simply have to switch to Night Sight mode in the camera app, and Astro mode will appear on the slider, where you can adjust the timer (see image above).</p><p>It&apos;s certainly a handy change, especially for Pixel owners who may not have known how to enable Astrophotography mode. This should make it easier to take cool images of the night sky, especially if and when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/may-2024-northern-lights-pixel-8-pro-galaxy-s24-plus">northern lights</a> decide to make another appearance in lower latitudes.</p>

Now, Google is giving Gemini a bit of a visual upgrade, which appeared on Pixel phones and is rolling out widely.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/23/gemini-glow-floating-overlay/">9to5Google</a>, the visual upgrade may look the same, but you&apos;ll notice there&apos;s a glow around the Gemini box when you bring up the assistant. However, it&apos;s not just a new glow that this brings; this signals a notable change in how Gemini behaves, which will now bring up answers in a floating box instead of taking up the full screen.</p><p>The new UI will help users use Gemini more contextually. It will allow users to drag and drop generated images into apps and ask for information about content on certain apps, like YouTube.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#gemini-on-android">announced</a> this new Gemini experience back in May during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>, so it&apos;s good to see it reaching users now.</p>

Google is now building on this with a new Polish feature, which will essentially take what you&apos;ve already written and turn it into something more palatable.</p><p>To further refine your email, you can choose options such as Formalize, Elaborate, and Shorten to better correspond with what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>You&apos;ll find this in the <strong>Refine my drafts</strong> option, which will now appear in email drafts on mobile devices when there are 12 or more words present.</p><p>These options, including Help me write, are available on Android and iOS devices, but you have to be a Workspace user with Google One AI Premium, Gemini Business/Enterprise add-on, or Gemini Education/Premium add-on.</p>

However, there are limits put in place to help prevent the generation of offensive or illegal content. As a result, the model won&apos;t (or shouldn&apos;t) produce images of public figures or any weapon-related visuals to prevent misuse.</p><p>It&apos;s actually pretty easy to get started, as you just need to head over to Google&apos;s ImageFX AI Test Kitchen and sign in with your Google account. And according to Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">this is something you should definitely try for yourself</a>.</p>
