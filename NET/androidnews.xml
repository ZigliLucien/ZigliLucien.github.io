<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A Reddit user already has their hands on YouTube Music 2024 Recap.</li><li>The Recap, which should normally arrive towards the end of November or the first week of December, is already here for some.</li><li>If more users get the Recap in the coming days, it will be quite earlier than Spotify's Wrapped.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music has a fancy way of engaging its users by showing them the top songs, albums, and artists they've listened to over the year. It is called YouTube Music Recap. Some lucky users this year are getting an early preview of their recaps.</p><p>A Reddit user, FesteringDarkness (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-2024-recap-early-3500210/">Android Authority</a>), appears to be one of the lucky YouTube Music users who have already gotten their hands on the YouTube Recap 2024. Per the shared screenshot of the latest Recap, one can see the user's respective Top artists and Top Tracks on YouTube Music that they listened to the most throughout 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1grmzb1/got_my_yearly_recap">Got my yearly recap</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic">r/YoutubeMusic</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Additionally, users can see the number of total minutes they spent on the YouTube Music app listening to their favorites. Alongside the top tracks and artists, users can notice their top albums as well. While the Recap is kind of new to YouTube's streaming platform, its competitor Spotify has had it for a while, dubbed Spotify Wrapped.</p><p>If history is any guide, the latter's summary frequently arrives early. Just after Spotify's Wrapped last year, YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">released its 2023 Recap</a>, which took place in late November 2023. Even though we are in the same month this year, some individuals receiving it ahead of schedule could indicate that YouTube Music will release the Recap early.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the person who received it might have been extremely fortunate, or there might have been a glitch in the streaming service. As more users may receive it in the upcoming weeks, it should become evident.</p><p>Users who want to access their Recap on YouTube Music can either look for the banner, which should appear when the Recap of their music is ready, or navigate to the "Your Recap" section from their My Account page on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming app</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube and YouTube Music gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-and-youtube-music-gain-new-improvements">some nifty improvements</a> through a major update last month. The music streaming service has introduced new Badges, which users can add to their favorite creators.</p><p>Also, both have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">gained the ability</a> to customize their playlist thumbnails by choosing a photo of their personal choice or relying on Generative AI entirely.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is allegedly in the process of a new project dubbed "Snowy," which is rumored to be a "Pixel laptop."</li><li>The device is supposedly being created to combat Apple's MacBook Pro and Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook.</li><li>Google bowed out of the laptop game years ago and the recent Chromebook Plus from Samsung packs a lot of its Gemini smarts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Curious new rumors claim Google might re-enter the laptop space with a "Pixel Laptop" of its own.</p><p>This rumor stems from an alleged "internal email" obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">Android Headlines</a>. According to its post, Google is preparing to begin developing a new laptop. The publication states the project is known internally as "Snowy." There are conflicting reports on what such a device could run as an OS (operating system).</p><p>The post suggests Google could empower the laptop with ChromeOS; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">another report</a> states this could end up turning into Android, instead. Mishaal Rahman for Android Authority claims that a source informed him that Google was moving into a "multi-year project to fully turn Chrome OS into Android."</p><p>Allegedly, this is done with the notion of competing with Apple's iPad experience. Google is also reportedly working on a large number of Android features to improve the desktop-like experience by upgrading its keyboard and mouse support.</p><p>Additional rumors claim the "Pixel laptop," or whatever it may be called, will feature a "premium build." It seems the supposed email lacks extra details on this matter. Elsewhere, the publication notes that Google is reportedly building this new laptop and comparing it against Apple's MacBook Pro, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-vs-galaxy-chromebook">Galaxy Chromebook</a>, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop among others.</p><p>It is extremely early for such a leak, so take things with a grain of salt as "Project Snowy" might not come to fruition.</p>

<p>It's worth remembering that Google once had its own laptop, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook-review">the Pixelbook</a>, several years ago. At the time, the company called its in-house device "the laptop reimagined." Google deployed a laptop with a thin profile with power specs (at the time) that was a breath of fresh air for consumers looking for a computer. The company then followed things up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-looks-step-wrong-direction">Pixelbook Go</a>, which was notably a step in the wrong direction.</p><p>Unfortunately, we never got a "Pixelbook 2," though it seems <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook">Samsung continued the dreams</a> we once had for Google.</p><p>It remains to be seen where the company will go with this (potential) laptop resurgence. Remember: Samsung launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">new Chromebook Plus</a> in October alongside Lenovo's newest model. The Korean OEM's model features a 15.6-inch display and an 11.8mm profile at 2.5lbs. What's more, the highlight of the laptop was its suite if Gemini tools.</p><p>The device boasts several AI-based features like "help me write," "help me read," Chat with Gemini, and more. Considering Google's heavy investment in AI — especially after its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-second-reorg-gemini-assistant-moves">second major reorg</a> for the betterment of the software — it seems right that this alleged "Pixel laptop" followed a similar route.</p>

<p>After launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in China, the phone maker is set to bring its latest flagship to global markets soon. While we've seen its specs and features, OnePlus is supposedly tweaking the color and storage options for the international release.</p><p>OnePlus has traditionally focused on China first, launching exclusive colors for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">flagship devices</a>. But a new leak suggests the OnePlus 13 will take a more global approach, with a consistent lineup for international markets.</p><p>Leaker Arsène Lupin (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-13r-global-colors-ram-storage-configs-3499913/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) has uncovered the global configurations and color options for the OnePlus 13 and its budget-friendly sibling, the OnePlus 13R. The base OnePlus 13 will allegedly come with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though it'll only be available in Black Eclipse.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 5G16/51212/256 (only Black Ecplise)Black EclipseMidnight OceanArctic DawnOnePlus 13R 5G12/256Nebula NoirAstral TrailGlobal soon<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857064642243092537">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Alongside the base model, OnePlus might release a OnePlus 13 variant with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. This high-end version is said to come in three stunning colors: Midnight Ocean (blue), Black Eclipse (black), and Arctic Dawn (white). Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>’s staggered rollout, the white color could be available from day one.</p><p>As a result, if you're eyeing the more vibrant colors, you'll have to go for the 16GB/512GB variant, which comes at a higher price than the base model.</p><p>Though options like the 12GB/512GB and the massive 24GB/1TB variants are available in China, they’re missing from the leak, suggesting that these models may not make it to international markets.</p><p>Furthermore, the leak spills the beans on the budget-friendly OnePlus 13R. The device is said to come in just one configuration—12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage—and two colors: Nebula Noir and Astral Trail. Even though the 13R hasn’t launched in China yet, it’s expected to arrive globally alongside the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R is expected to be called the OnePlus Ace 5 in its home turf, though the phone maker hasn't officially unveiled the device in China yet. After its debut, it's expected to be rebranded as the OnePlus 13R globally.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 series should be hitting global markets in the next few months, probably with a price bump compared to the OnePlus 12.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung highlighted its newly developed camera technology: ALoP (All Lenses on Prism).</li><li>This technology places the lenses "horizontally" instead of vertically, which is said to increase the lens size/diameter without creating a massive bump.</li><li>The constant struggle between bigger cameras and a larger bump was something Google's Pixel designer echoed in August.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung details some new camera technology that may alleviate the dreaded "camera bump" issue.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/tech-blog/samsung-isocell-alop-camera-technology-brightens-the-night-but-keeps-the-camera-slim/">tech post</a>, the company is developing a new telephoto camera technology under the name "ALoP" (All Lenses of Prism). The post states this is a "future telephoto camera solution" that retains clarity and brightness during the day or night. Usually, smartphones with a "set of large telephoto lenses" would have a rather noticeable camera bump.</p><p>However, Samsung states it aims to rectify that with its ALoP technology. The company says its new method uses a new optical structure that places the lenses "horizontally upon the prism, remaining in the plane of the smartphone body." Samsung states it can increase the effective lens size and diameter with ALoP <em>without </em>increasing the module's size (which gives us the camera bump).</p><p>The standard "folded" method places the camera's optics length-wise, meaning they're stacked vertically, pushing up against the phone's rear panel.</p><p>Samsung claims that its ALoP method not only reduces the size and thickness of a camera bump, but it has an additional key benefit: brightness.</p><p>The post states the ALoP technology can accommodate an <em>f</em>/2.5 aperture 80mm lens on a phone. Essentially, the lower the aperture number, the wider the lens opens for darker shots to receive more light. Samsung hopes this can provide consumers with a noise reduction when taking nighttime shots.</p><p>Another positive side effect is the ergonomic or aesthetical side of a camera bump reduction. Samsung states the ALoP method can potentially help it retain the "sleek" appearance of a phone since the "jarring" look of the bump is reduced.</p>

<p>Samsung cited increased consumer interest in cameras as a catalyst behind <em>why </em>OEMs have added more lenses, creating a "crowded" array. This was a sentiment echoed by Google after it launched the Pixel 9 series with its (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large and proud</a>) camera bump. Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger said that user interest is the reason behind "larger lenses and sensors.</p><p>Of course, wanting a lens with a longer focal length or with a lower aperture is nice, but that comes at a cost. Zellweger teased that a thinner camera bump could be possible in the future and that the Pixel 9's current design might not last forever.</p><p>For Samsung, it's unclear <em>when </em>we could see the ALoP tech's influence on a Galaxy device's telephoto module. Early rumors about the Galaxy S25 claim it will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">similar camera specs</a> to its 2024 iteration. However, a major camera development could arrive for the alleged "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">Galaxy S25 Slim</a>" with a strength that mirrors the Ultra model.</p>

<p>OnePlus is beating the rest of the Android tablet market to the punch, releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> this week. It's the first Android tablet not made by Google to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1729408615594328065" target="_blank">announced</a> the stable rollout on its community forum, which is starting in India, Europe, and global markets now. Later this week, the update will make its way to North America, including U.S. users.</p><p>OnePlus seems to be taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">Samsung's One UI delay</a>, releasing Android 15 for its phone and tablets quickly. Its flagship phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, got the boost to OxygenOS 15 earlier this month. Now, many of the update's highlights will also come to the OnePlus Pad 2, including smoother animations and better multitasking features.</p><p>The stable build for OxygenOS 15 for the OnePlus Pad 2 in India, Europe, and global markets is <strong>OPD2403_15.0.0.201(EX01)</strong>. It's rolling out in batches, so you may not see it on your tablet immediately. The company also shared rollback options in case you want to revert to OxygenOS 14.</p>

<p>OnePlus lists a few top OxygenOS 15 features for the OnePlus Pad 2 in the update's first changelog. It starts with "ultra animation effects," which include a system-level swiping curve for third-party apps. Additionally, many Home Screen and system icons have been redesigned. There's now a split mode for the notification drawer and Quick Settings, which makes the UI feel more like iOS.</p><p>There are some new multitasking tools that will be especially appreciated by tablet users. You can pull down on a notification banner to open up an app in a floating window. These floating windows can be moved with new gestures, like pulling down on a floating window to turn it into a full-screen app. You can swipe up to close the floating window completely.</p><p>Although Samsung just launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">new tablets</a>, they're still stuck on Android 14 — and will be for some time. OnePlus' quick release of Android 15 gives it an edge with the OnePlus Pad 2.

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6's upcoming PUBG Mobile tournament should be exciting. Though not advertised as a gaming phone, the Fold 6 can handle the intense pressure of a competitive battle royale experience with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC for Galaxy. The chip empowers Samsung's latest book-style foldable with speed and performance that can handle games <em>and </em>multitasking.</p><p>Michael Ashford, CEO of the Esports Awards stated, "Samsung Galaxy devices are known for their performance, something that is highly sought after by a number of our finalists in the Esports Awards and the Mobies. We are proud to welcome them as Official Mobile Partner and Title Sponsor, and to have them so integrated into our ceremonies and PWR UP Week."</p>

<hr>
<p>Find yourself scrolling on social media apps, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-case-against-tiktok-might-spur-the-section-230-reform-we-desperately-need">TikTok</a>, for too long? A new feature coming to many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> will give you a slight nudge when you use selected apps for a while. It's called <strong>Screen time reminders</strong>, and the Digital Wellbeing tool appears to be widely rolling out now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nail_Sadykov/" target="_blank">Nail Sadykov</a> and Mishaal Rahman both reported seeing the feature on their phones, Rahman shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1857864864162590887" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p><p>Screen time reminders were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-digital-wellbeing-mindful-upgrade-spotted">initially discovered in an APK teardown last month</a>, under the codename "Mindful Nudge." Now, it's available on Google Pixel devices, but also many other Android phones from brands like Nothing and OnePlus. Notably, the reminders haven't been spotted on Samsung phones yet. That isn't exactly surprising, since Samsung has its own digital health features baked into One UI.</p><p>The feature can be found under the <strong>Screen time reminders </strong>tab on the <strong>Digital Wellbeing</strong> page in the Settings app. "Stay in control of your digital habits with Screen time reminders," the splash screen explains. "Get occasional reminders that show how much time you're spending on the app."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is rolling out a new feature in the Digital Wellbeing app called screen time reminders.

This feature gives you gentle reminders when you've been using selected apps for a long time. The reminder comes in the form of a pill that appears at the top of the screen.

<p>Google calls these "gentle reminders," and they're fairly unobtrusive. After a set period of time, like 15 or 25 minutes, a pill-shaped overlay can appear at the top of your screen showing how much time you've spent on an app. You can tap the pill notification to expand it, where you'll see a checkbox for <strong>Don't show reminders for this app</strong> and a button to jump straight to <strong>Screen time reminders</strong> settings.</p><p>Users can customize which apps participate in Screen time reminders, but they can't change the intervals at which notifications are sent. Unlike app time limits, these nudges won't prevent you from using a particular app — they'll just make sure you know just how long you've been doomscrolling. If you aren't interested, there's a universal toggle for Screen time reminders that can be flipped on or off.</p><p>The feature is separate from the rest of Digital Wellbeing, so you can get Screen time reminders without needing to turn on things like app limits. Early indications are that these "gentle reminders" could be a great way to acknowledge when you've spent too long in a single app to avoid doomscrolling and time-wasting.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google seems to be working on bringing categories for upcoming radio station features on Android Auto.</li><li>Found in the latest Android Auto app beta, the new findings imply the launch of the radio feature could still be in the works. </li><li>Alongside the radio station categories, the app's backend findings reveal some music genres.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been testing a comeback for the classic radio feature on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> over the past few months. Now, Android Auto's latest beta release adds a new media control, letting you switch between radio stations with ease.</p><p>In their latest APK Insight, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/13/android-auto-13-3-radio-station-teardown/">9to5Google</a> have shared interesting details of the Android Auto 13.3 app running in beta. The new version seems to include a behind-the-scenes list of music genres and categories for radio stations. While it’s not yet available for beta testers to play with, it’s clearly in the works.</p>
<p>The list shared by 9to5 includes a host of categories, such as Adult hits, country music, news, jazz, rock, and science. As mentioned, the functionality to play radio or even a car's local media—first found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-likely-to-allow-local-media-playback">previous beta version</a> of the app in early September—is still unavailable.</p><p>It’s definitely refreshing to see Google putting in the effort behind the scenes to bring back classic car features, like playing local media or radio, instead of just relying on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like we do now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="xayoqKhJY2MDDPsJzzcHHQ" name="android-auto-save-parking.jpg" alt="Android Auto save parking toggle on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xayoqKhJY2MDDPsJzzcHHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The aforementioned categories are expected to appear in an upcoming "Car Media" app that the search giant is working on through Android Auto. 9to5 also notes that there are new, updated icons, which we might witness when the rollout happens officially.</p><p>We’re still waiting on the official launch of the new Android Auto features. Android Auto already makes life easier with built-in Google Maps and integrations like Google Calendar, Messages, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>. Adding classic features is a nice bonus for commuters, offering a bit of variety for those long drives.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6 is $140 off</strong></a>, while the Watch 7 and Ultra already hit all-time lows. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/c/promotions/holiday-sale-guide-americas/">Garmin Holiday Sale</a> has most of our favorites at $100+ off. Not everything is discounted, but almost all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best watches</a> have been or <em>will</em> be at some point; you don't have to "hunt" for deals; just wait.</p><p>Smart ring discounts are rarer. You can find cheap, unreliable rings on Amazon anytime, but for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> — especially Oura — deals are infrequent <em>and</em> more likely to sell out. Unlike one-size-fits-all smartwatches, smart rings often sell out in certain ring sizes and finishes — especially if you have to wait for a ring sizing kit first.</p><p>At the moment, some of our favorite last-gen smart rings are discounted, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RingConn-Subscription-Activity-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B0D1456Q8Q"><strong>RingConn Gen 1 for $199 (27% off)</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Horizon-Tracking/dp/B0CSR7G7NX"><strong>Oura Ring Gen 3 for $299 ($50 off)</strong></a>. For the latest and greatest smart rings, though, you'll have to wait until Black Friday, as many of them — like the Oura Ring 4, Samsung Galaxy Ring, and Ultrahuman Ring Air — are full-price and fairly expensive compared to watches.</p>

It's incredibly affordable (especially for this pre-Black Friday price) and the most accurate we've tested for heart rate data. It's comfortably light, syncs well with your Amazfit watch, and has an EDA sensor for accurate stress.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5LPZHLB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="46933a42-dd44-489c-856e-b0f4ae032faf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazfit Helio Ring" data-dimension48="Amazfit Helio Ring" data-dimension25="$149">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Amazfit and RingConn have these Black Friday smart ring deals available now for anyone wanting to try a smart ring for cheap without really <em>committing</em> to the idea of wearing one. But by Black Friday, we can hope to see deals on favorites like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> that offer great style, battery life, accuracy, and features.</p><p>There were some solid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitfam-if-you-like-it-you-should-put-a-smart-ring-on-it-before-prime-day-ends">Prime Day smart ring deals</a> last month, and we can only assume they'll dip as low (or even lower) in a couple of weeks. So keep an eye out!</p>
<h2 id="a-smart-ring-won-t-replace-your-smartwatch-it-s-a-luxury-2">A smart ring won't replace your smartwatch; it's a luxury</h2>
<p>If the point of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Black Friday deals</a> is to splurge on something you normally wouldn't, then a smart ring fits that theme better. People <em>need</em> smartwatches for notifications, workouts, maps, and the like. If you compare <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-key-differences">smartwatch vs. smart rings</a>, you'll find they cover a lot of the same ground for features and health tracking.</p><p>So why buy a smart ring? They ensure you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">don't have to wear an uncomfortable watch at night</a> to get 24/7 data on your sleep quality, stress, and heart health; and if you buy the right smart ring, it'll look sleek and stylish doing it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wWGBexAa84bcajKekXViRY" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-1.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWGBexAa84bcajKekXViRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That won't be enough to appeal to everyone, but smart rings have become increasingly popular for a reason. People who prefer non-smart luxury watches to smartwatches can still get the basic health data they want; and since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-wearable-band-market-Q2-2024">basic watches outsold smartwatches this year</a>, I'm guessing there's a lot of you out there who'd benefit from one.</p><p>Smart rings aren't perfect. We've found that they're very accurate for normal at-rest HR data but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-ring-hr-accuracy-test">can struggle with workout results</a>, and while they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">shockingly good at step counting</a> when you're out and about, they tend to generate a lot of false steps when you're just sitting at your desk typing or gesticulating.</p><p>In other words, smart rings are still in their early stages, improving their accuracy and usefulness over time. And since so many companies are trying to establish themselves in the smart ring market, they're all charging a high amount to break even on their R&D.</p><p>That's why Black Friday is the right time to buy one, if you're going to: it's the rare moment when smart rings won't be a bit overpriced for what they can do, so you can jump in on the trend without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-fitness-bands-vs-smart-rings-2">What about fitness bands vs. smart rings?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PRD4QshXhNpaRNTRvmftEP" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-and-smart-ring.jpeg" alt="The Fitbit Charge 6 and a smart ring next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRD4QshXhNpaRNTRvmftEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings can't replace smartwatches, but they basically exist to replace cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> or Xiaomi Smart Band 9.</p><p>These devices may have screens for notifications, but in other respects they have few of the smarts of a traditional smartwatch. They're there to track your health and workouts, aligning with smart rings' main purpose.</p><p>Because fitness bands have more space for health sensors and your full wrist instead of a tiny strip of finger skin to work with, they tend to be more accurate for workouts. But like smartwatches, they're less comfortable for sleep tracking and more liable to get dislodged from your wrist by a bad sleep position, while your well-fitted smart ring stays comfortably in place.</p><p>And unlike smartwatches, fitness bands honestly aren't particularly attractive. They're "sporty" at best and cheap-looking at worst, which gives smart rings the edge.</p><p>Still, a fitness tracker lets you check notifications, can buzz you awake without a traditional alarm, and costs significantly less even before Black Friday deals come into play. So if you're more concerned about function than looks, a fitness band may be the better option for you.</p>
