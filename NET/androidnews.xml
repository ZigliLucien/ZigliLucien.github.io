The next step would be to go to the governor&apos;s desk to either be signed into law or rejected and sent back for more voting. We should all hope the latter happens because signing this bill into law solves none of AI&apos;s problems and would actually worsen the problems it intends to fix through regulation.</p>

<p>SB 1047 is not completely bad. Things like forcing companies to implement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-sundar-pichai-argues-ai-regulation">reasonable security protections</a> or a way to shut any remote capability down when a problem arises are great ideas. However, the provisions of corporate liability and vague definitions of harm should stop the bill in its tracks until some changes are made.</p><p>You can do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">terrible things using AI</a>. I&apos;m not denying that, and I think there needs to be some sort of regulatory oversight to monitor its capabilities and the safety guardrails of its use. Companies developing AI should do their best to prevent users from doing anything illegal with it, but with AI at your fingertips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on your phone</a>, people will find ways to do it anyway.</p><p>When people inevitably find ways to sidestep those guidelines, those people need to be held responsible not the minds that developed the software. There is no reason laws can&apos;t be created to hold people liable for the things they do and those laws should be enforced with the same gusto that existing laws are.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m trying to politely say is laws like this are dumb. All laws — even the ones you might like — that hold companies creating legal and beneficial goods, physical or digital, responsible for the actions of people who use their services are dumb. That means holding Google or Meta responsible for AI misuse is just as dense as holding Smith & Wesson responsible because of things people do. Laws and regulations should never be about what makes us comfortable. Instead, they should exist to place responsibility where it belongs and make criminals liable for their actions.</p><p>AI can be used to do despicable things like fraud and other financial crimes as well as social crimes like creating fake images of people doing something they never did. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640807/">It can also do great things</a> like detect cancer, help create life-saving medications, and make our roads safer.</p>
<p>Creating a law that makes AI developers responsible will stifle those innovations, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mozilla.ai/">open-source AI development</a> where there aren&apos;t billions of investment capital flowing like wine. Every new idea or change of existing methods means a team of legal professionals will need to comb through, making sure the companies behind these projects won&apos;t be sued once someone does something bad with it — not <em>if</em> someone does something bad, but <em>when</em>. </p><p>No company is going to move its headquarters out of California or block its products for use in California. They will just have to spend money that could be used to further research and development in other areas, leading to higher consumer costs or less research and product development. Money does not grow on trees even for companies with trillion-dollar market caps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="pJ9KAxguQALkJzeWfxQmWA" name="mozilla-ai.png" alt="Mozilla AI logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJ9KAxguQALkJzeWfxQmWA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="995" height="561" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mozilla)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is why almost every company at the leading edge of AI development is against this bill and is urging Governor Newsom to veto it the way it stands now. You would naturally expect to see some profit-driven organizations like Google or Meta speak out against this bill, but the "good guys" in tech, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/08/19/mozilla-eleutherai-and-hugging-face-provide-comments-on-californias-sb-1047/">like Mozilla</a>, are also against it as written.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/un-global-ai-resolution">AI needs regulation</a>. I hate seeing a government step into any industry and create miles of red tape in an attempt to solve problems, but some situations require it. Someone has to try and look out for citizens, even if it has to be a government filled with partisanship and technophobic officials. In his case there simply isn&apos;t a better solution.</p><p>However, there needs to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">a <em>nationwide</em> way</a> to oversee the industry, built with feedback from people who understand the technology and <strong>have no financial interest</strong>. California, Maryland, or Massachusetts making piecemeal regulations only makes the problem worse, not better. AI is not going away, and anything regulated in the U.S. will exist elsewhere and still be widely available for people who want to misuse it. </p><p>Apple is not responsible for criminal activity committed using a MacBook. Stanley is not responsible for assault committed with a hammer. Google, Meta, or OpenAI is not responsible for how people misuse their AI products.</p>

The company is discontinuing the line in favor of the fenix line and the new Garmin fenix 8, which now features both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP</a> and AMOLED models. The updated design features "leakproof metal buttons" and a 40-meter dive rating for those of you who like to explore ocean depths.</p><p>As far as software, users can take advantage of access to the on-device Garmin Messages app and smart commands for AI assistants. Athletes should also enjoy the new "Advanced Strength Training" with dedicated plans for various sports like surfing, skiing, trail runners, and more.</p><p>You can get up to 48 days of battery life with the fenix 8 Solar, but the fenix 8 AMOLED still manages an impressive 29 days.</p>

<p>The Enduro 3 can last up to 90 days on a single charge and has a durable design with a titanium bezel and sapphire lens covering the 1.4-inch MIP display. Like the fenix 8, you get preloaded topographic maps and advance strength training features. It&apos;s also capablt of ECG readings for AFib detection.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228493/pn/010-02903-00">fenix 8 retails for $999</a> while the Enduro 3 can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/851039">purchased for $899</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>While rumors of tri-fold phones from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-tri-fold-phone-former-ceo-photographed">Huawei</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-tri-fold-phone-development-rumor">Xiaomi</a> have been rumored, TECNO came out of nowhere and revealed one of its own. The TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2 is actually a new concept device, following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-is-the-latest-brand-to-unfurl-a-rollable-phone-concept">last year&apos;s rollable phone</a> reveal.</p><p>The Phantom Ultimate 2 starts with a 6.48-inch screen that can be expanded to a 10-inch AMOLED display. What&apos;s interesting is that the phone can be put into various forms for specific use cases, such as watching media, multitasking, live translation, and more.</p><p>When folded, the phone measures only 11mm thick, which is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. This is thanks to a new hinge mechanism that allows for incredibly thin dual-fold phones. TECNO has not revealed any additional specs for the device, but it at least has a triple camera system on the rear.</p>

The popular repair shop shows us just how easy it is to take the phone apart, in case you may want to repair it. The video shows that while there are some improvements, Google also made some questionable choices with how the device is assembled.</p><p>When carefully removing the screen, the display became quite damaged, which was surprising. Fortunately, thanks to the dual-entry design, the screen doesn&apos;t need to be removed if you need to replace the battery, which is a plus. However, things start looking grim again when it actually comes to removing the battery, which proved more difficult than it should be.</p><p>You can take a look at the full video above, but Android Central senior editor Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-ifixit-teardown-gives-me-doubts">can&apos;t imagine this phone lasting seven years</a> given how difficult it is to repair.</p>

Now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> has joined in the fun, quietly launching a similar feature.</p><p>As pointed out by Android Authority, Adaptive Touch is a display feature you can enable on the Pixel 9, where touch sensitivity "will automatically adjust to your environment, activities and screen protector."

The company states that while Imagen 3 can generate photorealistic landscapes and other things, it&apos;s placing some limitations when it comes to generating images of people.</p><p>"We don’t support the generation of photorealistic, identifiable individuals, depictions of minors or excessively gory, violent or sexual scenes," Google states in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-update-august-2024/">blog post</a>. It also notes that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> won&apos;t always get it right and that the company will continue to improve the experience.</p><p>This will be available first to Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users.</p><p>In addition to image generation, Google is now rolling out Gems, which are custom versions of Gemini that businesses and enterprise users can take advantage of for specific purposes. Users will be able to describe what they want their Gem to do to create a personalized experience. The company lists examples such as a gym buddy, sous chef, coding partner, or creative writing guide.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When leaks highlighted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series would get a new app called Pixel Screenshots, I didn&apos;t pay much attention. I thought it was just a location to save all screenshots, but I was wrong; while Pixel Screenshots manages to store all your screenshots, it does so much more: it uses Google&apos;s Gemini Nano on-device AI engine to parse through the information in the screenshot, and make it easily accessible.</p><p>I tend to take screenshots of billing details and other order-related information, but that&apos;s unorganized, and I have to manually search screenshots to usually locate the details I need. That&apos;s where Pixel Screenshots makes a difference; the app automatically creates a title and summary of the content included in the screenshot, so if there&apos;s a reminder or an upcoming event, you can easily add it to your calendar.</p><p>In just over a week of using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Pixel Screenshots has already made a difference. I get a lot of briefing invites, and the ability to just take a screenshot and add the event to my calendar is nifty. Another cool utility in Pixel Screenshots is the ability to organize content; you can set up custom lists for various things like deals, order-related information, and so on.</p><p>The biggest advantage of the app is that it allows you to search saved screenshots, so if you need details on a package or want the order number of something you bought a few months ago, you can just ask a search query similar to Google Search and it will pull up that information.</p><p>Honestly, Pixel Screenshots has been a revelation, and it makes saving key information — and accessing it later on — a breeze.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-the-pixel-screenshots-app-2">How to get the Pixel Screenshots app</h2>
<p>The Pixel Screenshots app is limited to the Pixel 9 series, so that means you&apos;ll need to pick up one of the four devices in the lineup to be able to access it. As it uses a new multimodal version of Gemini Nano, it isn&apos;t available on Google&apos;s older phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and 8 Pro.</p><p>Because of that reason, it&apos;s unlikely to make its way to other devices. You can download the APK and install it on a non-Pixel device, but it will not download the Gemini Nano model as other devices don&apos;t have the requisite hardware.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-pixel-screenshots-2">How to use Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>Using Pixel Screenshots is easy; just pull up the Screenshots app from the app drawer, and you&apos;ll see all your saved screenshots. You can just tap on any screenshot to see the auto-generated summary detailing the information contained within; if there&apos;s any actionable content — like an event — you&apos;ll get a button to add the details to your calendar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.12%;"><img id="zboZq5FetrcsP3jN8hDSvE" name="pixel-gemini-nano-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zboZq5FetrcsP3jN8hDSvE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part of the app is its ability to search screenshots; you can query using the search bar at the bottom, and it will pull up any information that matches the search. It is straightforward to use, and does a good job surfacing order-related details and so on.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-organize-screenshots-in-pixel-screenshots-2">How to organize screenshots in Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>Pixel Screenshots lets you organize screenshots into various categories, so if you&apos;re setting up gift ideas, want to store all billing and order details in one location, you can do so easily.</p>
<p>1. In the Collections sub-menu within Pixel Screenshots, select the Plus icon.<br>
2. Enter the name of the category.<br>
3. You can now add all relevant screenshots to this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.39%;"><img id="tutgygzFax8oKGctFApYWZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-3.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tutgygzFax8oKGctFApYWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="932" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-set-reminders-in-pixel-screenshots-2">How to set reminders in Pixel Screenshots</h2>
<p>I normally use Any.do to set up reminders, but Pixel Screenshots is highly effective in this regard. If I need to set a reminder for an actionable email, I just take a screenshot, and set a reminder within Screenshots. It&apos;s easy to set up:</p>
<p>1. Pull up the screenshot where you want to create a reminder.<br>
2. Select the Belli icon. <br>
3. You&apos;ll see four choices: Later today sets a reminder an hour from now, Tomorrow sets it 24 hours later, Next week sets a reminder at the same time next week, and you get an option to choose the date and time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.90%;"><img id="bhjBRguHUfFRFhyWymdYfZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-2.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhjBRguHUfFRFhyWymdYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="1002" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Once you select the date and time, hit Save to save the reminder.<br>
5. You&apos;ll see the reminder details next to the Bell icon.<br>
6. You can also see all upcoming reminders in the main window.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.27%;"><img id="jDUssy6G5tq83XMroGRgMZ" name="pixel-gemini-ai-4.jpeg" alt="Pixel Screenshots on the Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDUssy6G5tq83XMroGRgMZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1270" height="994" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<hr>
<p>Google is leveraging its Gemini Nano engine to catalog and organize the details included in screenshots, and the best part is that it is all done on-device — no data is sent to the cloud. The fact that all of this is done on-device is pretty cool, and Pixel Screenshots is another utility that differentiates Pixels.</p>

<ul><li>Apple Music and YouTube Music both now support the transfer of music playlists.</li><li>On the corresponding support page, both companies shared the process of transferring playlists.</li><li>Currently, the transfer is supported across these music streaming services only.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Apple Music and Google&apos;s YouTube Music have partnered to offer their users a hassle-free experience, including the ability to transfer saved playlists across music streaming platforms.</p><p>Previously, transferring playlists from one streaming platform to another wasn&apos;t that convenient, as it involved third-party apps like Soundiiz and Tune My Music. Such apps also required a fee to transfer songs/ playlists without any restrictions. It might soon change with the newly announced ability for Apple Music and YouTube Music users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer/">MacRumors</a>).</p>
<p>Users who wish to transfer their playlists from Apple Music to YouTube Music or vice versa can now do so, as both streaming giants have shared the respective step-by-step process through their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120030">support pages</a>. Apple account holders can head to their Data and Privacy page and request to "Transfer a copy of your data." Users can then select Apple Music playlists to be transferred to YouTube Music. </p><p>Likewise, YouTube Music users will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/14792019">able to transfer</a> their playlists through the Google Takeout feature. They can similarly follow the onscreen instructions to transfer playlists from YouTube Music to Apple Music. While the process appears hassle-free, there are a few things to keep in mind before transferring.</p>

<p>To make playlist transfer more swift, users must have an active subscription to the aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming platforms</a>. While playlists are transferred quickly, they won&apos;t be deleted once the transfer is done. Also, transfers are only possible between Apple Music and YouTube Music, not even Spotify. Users would still have to rely on the above-mentioned third-party services for any music transfer.</p><p>The latest transferring feature doesn&apos;t support other songs in the library except from the playlists. It is also dependent on song availability across both platforms, meaning that when a song from a playlist isn&apos;t available on the other platform that is being shared, users can still be out of luck.</p><p>While it is an exciting start to see transferring music to an extent between Apple Music and YouTube Music, it will be more beneficial if other major players in the music streaming industry also collaborate with each other to bring users a unified experience and easy switching between streaming platforms.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors from Chinese social media, Weibo, claim OnePlus could "advance" its press conference this year for new devices to late October or November.</li><li>This would see the OnePlus 13 launching earlier than expected, potentially around November 11 in China.</li><li>The OnePlus 13 is rumored to feature the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, a 6,000mAh battery, and upgrades to its ultrawide and periscope cameras.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up for its yearly flagship phone launch and rumors claim it could happen a little sooner this time.</p><p>This claim was posted by Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OuwOK9A9B?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), stating the OnePlus 13 could see an earlier reveal in China in the next two or three months (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-launch-sooner-3476807/">Android Authority</a>). For context, the tipster states the company may "advance" its press conference, which is supposedly eyeing a "tentative" end-of-October date.</p><p>However, DCS states that OnePlus could end up pushing it into November, and if it does, the 13 series flagship could launch on November 11.</p><p>As the publication notes, OnePlus&apos; potential quick debut event might be done to capitalize on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon Summit</a>. The company confirmed it will debut the next Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC with Oryon CPU in October 2024. Debuting the OnePlus 13 swiftly after may be a tactic to help increase consumer awareness and thus profits.</p><p>That also means OnePlus&apos; next flagship would debut a month (or two) earlier than last year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> launched in China on December 5, 2023. This arrived a month earlier than the 11 series device, which saw a January 2023 debut on home soil. The global variant of the device typically follows a month prior, meaning if this is true, the OnePlus 13 could hit the U.S. in December.</p><p>Rumors about the device have slowly surfaced, with the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-battery-specifications-rumor">speculating about its battery</a>. A tipster claims the device could sport a 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired fast charging <em>and </em>50W wireless charging. The latter method was previously rumored to be missing this year, so we&apos;ll have to see where OnePlus sits officially later this year.</p><p>Those same rumors added that the OnePlus 13 may continue to offer a 50MP primary lens with the Lytia LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">Others purport</a> that the ultrawide and periscope lens as they may jump to 50MP. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 is suspected to rock a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display with a "micro-curved" glass top.</p>

<p>Google launched its fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat in early August, but user complaints are forcing a necessary change.</p><p>Consumers getting their hands on the 4th-gen Nest Learning Thermostat have started reporting displeasure with its display.

The user adds that approaching the device will prompt it to light up; however, it&apos;s lackluster as they can&apos;t read the numbers on the screen.</p><p>The consumer states that they&apos;re forced to be "on top of the thermostat" to see anything.</p><p>Another user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ9380EV0BAHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5BGST5N">hops on the bandwagon</a>, stating "the display looks great, but it&apos;s very dim." This comment also claims that it&apos;s hard to read what&apos;s on the display because of how dark it appears.</p><p>Moreover, Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich corroborates many of the negative reviews about Google&apos;s latest thermostat. The lack of brightness controls, resulting in a terribly dim display, was an aspect Sutrich complained about the most. Additionally, he states that it was "hard to get a good picture of it."</p><p>Google reportedly informed 9to5 that it&apos;s working to roll out brightness controls for the fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat. The company adds this should "arrive soon," but did not offer a concrete timeline.</p>

<p>Google highlighted its 4th-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> during its hardware event a few weeks ago. With nearly invisible bezels, the thermostat features home screen customization and Dynamic Farsight. The latter is an upgrade to the original version, which lets users see what&apos;s on the screen from afar. As you approach, the thermostat will display more details.</p><p>Unfortunately, with the awfully dim display problems, Google&apos;s Dynamic Farsight isn&apos;t getting time to shine (bad joke).</p><p>Elsewhere, Google&apos;s thermostat upgrade would likely serve as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-google-pixel-watch-models-should-steal-this-nest-learning-thermostat-design-feature">fantastic Pixel Watch iteration in the future</a>. The new smart home device is used with touch as it lacks any sort of physical button. This idea <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-patent-shows-touch-bezel-controls">was rumored</a> for the Pixel Watch 3, but it never came to pass.</p>

<ul><li>Honor highlighted a new feature arriving for the upcoming MagicPad 2 called "AI Formula Recognition" alongside YouTuber Patrick Jones.</li><li>The AI software recognizes the complexity of a user's handwritten math equations to digitize them.</li><li>Honor is set to make the tablet's full announcement at IFA 2024 on September 5 in Berlin, Germany at 2 pm CEST (8 am EST).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor showed off how its AI software can assist users with complex math in a series of teases for its upcoming event.</p><p>In conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/5KYQ02kPq0k">YouTuber Patrick Jones</a>, runner of the patrickJMT channel, Honor&apos;s AI software was challenged with complex algebraic equations. The video was captured on Honor&apos;s new MagicPad 2 using a new AI feature called "AI Formula Recognition."</p><p>The company states that its Formula Recognition software lets users convert handwritten math equations into digital text. Honor sees its usefulness as two-pronged. Teachers can seamlessly take those digitized notes and offer them to students. Similarly, students can help make studying easier later on with digitized, searchable, and editable notes.</p><p>During Patrick&apos;s demo, users can tap the pi icon to produce a double text box. Users can highlight a specific area they want Honor&apos;s AI to digitize or they can write in a formula and pop it in after.</p><p>The AI&apos;s recognition of various math formulas, symbols, and the like was evident during Patrick&apos;s example. The video crawled through simple equations (2x + 3y = 8) to others that would boggle your mind if you weren&apos;t a mathematician.</p><p>Patrick needed to find "X" and "Y" in the video, which held the grand reveal we were waiting for. "X" came out to 9.05 while "Y" was 2024. Math aside, the answer is the date for Honor IFA 2024 in Berlin, Germany on September 5 at 2 pm CEST (8 am EST). Those interested can watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/5KYQ02kPq0k">Patrick Jones&apos; video</a> for a complex dive into Honor&apos;s AI prowess for math equations and discover a nod to Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>With Honor&apos;s IFA event set for next week, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/events/honor-ifa/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=kol&utm_campaign=ifa2024">company highlighted</a> "what&apos;s next." One of the items listed was its recent launch of foldable phones, which are surprisingly thin. The Magic V3 and Magic Vs3 are Honor&apos;s latest book-style foldable devices that measure 9.2mm when folded. The company recently detailed how its foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-ultra-thin-durable-creation-details">defied the odds</a> regarding its thinness as Honor leaned heavily into the R&D behind its silicon-carbon battery.</p><p>But AI is the star of the show. Honor showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">some AI advancements</a> earlier this year during MWC 2024, including a look at its AI Defocus Eye Protection. This feature was designed to help cut back on eye strain and myopia by blurring peripheral vision.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ 
<p>I&apos;ve never been a person who enjoys wearing a watch. Even though I&apos;ve used dozens of smartwatches over the years, I seldom wear one all day long. That&apos;s where the idea of a smart ring comes in for me. As someone who already wears a wedding band every day and finds it comfortable, I had hoped a smart ring would feel like the ideal form factor when compared to cumbersome fitness straps or bulky watches.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is the latest smart ring to try to woo customers with its concept, which started in 2015 with the release of the first-generation Oura Ring. But if you were hoping to replace your smartwatch with the Galaxy Ring, you&apos;re going to need to temper your expectations.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is designed for 24/7 health tracking and little else. It&apos;ll automatically track walking, running, and even sleeping, but while Samsung&apos;s Health software gives you lots of data, I&apos;m not sure I trust most of it. It lacks AFib detection, something the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> recently added, making it mostly useless for 24/7 heart rate monitoring. Even the "find my ring" feature only really works on Samsung Galaxy phones, a hugely missed opportunity for Samsung to one-up the competition.</p><p>Samsung has a lot of improvements to make but, thankfully, all of them are software-related and <em>could</em> be addressed in the future through updates. Samsung doesn&apos;t charge a monthly subscription like Oura, but without any kind of meaningful heart monitoring data and no real support for working out with the ring, I&apos;m not sure what the point of wearing one is.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-review-2">About this review</h2>
<p>I&apos;ve been using the Galaxy Ring for five weeks as of the publishing of the final review on August 30, 2024. My gold size 10 Galaxy Ring has been paired with a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra running One UI 6.1, as well as a number of non-Samsung devices like the OnePlus 12 and CMF Phone 1.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring is available for $399 and comes in three classic ring colors: silver, gold, and black. Initial orders were back ordered due to popularity but Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-reportedly-boosts-galaxy-ring-production-to-match-soaring-demand">ramped up production substantially</a> to meet demand. The Galaxy Ring currently takes a few weeks to ship out once ordered.</p><p>To purchase a Galaxy Ring, you&apos;ll first need to spend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Receive-Towards-Purchase/dp/B0D3JDTZZQ">$10 on a sizing kit</a>. That comes with a $10 credit towards the purchase of a Galaxy Ring, so the sizing kit is effectively free once you buy a Ring. You can also find a sizing kit available at some Best Buy locations for free, so you may want to call around first before ordering a kit. Samsung makes Galaxy Rings in standard ring sizes 5–13.</p><p>Unlike its biggest competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, the Galaxy Ring doesn&apos;t require a monthly subscription to access your data. All that is handled through the Samsung Health app, which works with any Android phone. Samsung Galaxy phones with Galaxy AI built-in, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, will get extra insights for their data powered by Galaxy AI when paired with the Galaxy Ring. Additionally, you&apos;ll only get full ring tracking functionality and ring gestures when paired with a Samsung phone.</p>

<p>If I could get true feature parity, I&apos;d swap out a smartwatch for a smart ring nearly any day of the week. Except for some kinds of workouts, a smart ring is a significantly more comfortable device to wear 24/7 than a smartwatch.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s hardware design is largely excellent, stuffing a battery and tons of tech into a svelte ~2.6mm thick ring. This is notably thicker than some standard rings — like my gold wedding band — but it&apos;s not so thick as to feel <em>more</em> noticeable on my finger than a standard ring.</p><p>On release, Samsung was the thinnest smart ring until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a> came out just two weeks later. Unlike that ring, though, the Galaxy Ring is a perfect circle, while RingConn opted for a more unique squircle design.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Ring features a concave design that helps make the ring look thinner than it actually is, and the titanium construction is impressively light but I&apos;m not fully convinced of its durability. The concave design helps keep the center from getting scratched but it doesn&apos;t do so much for the edges.</p><p>After 5 weeks of use, the ring looks like it&apos;s seen 20 years of wear and tear. My 16-year-old gold wedding band looks in far better shape, for reference.</p><p>I ran a Spartan Race with the ring in early August because I wanted to see how it held up during an event that mostly consisted of running and walking with obstacles thrown in every few hundred meters. The result was less than excellent on all counts—which I&apos;ll detail further in the health tracking section below.</p><p>The biggest issue here isn&apos;t the questionable durability. It&apos;s the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech">smart rings aren&apos;t repairable</a>.</p>

<p>On the underside, you&apos;ll find an orientation indicator letting you know how to wear the ring. This line should always line up with the middle of the underside of your finger as it ensures the Ring&apos;s sensors are in the most optimal place. I would regularly check to make sure this indicator was in the right place and found it usually needed a few rotational fixes throughout the day.</p><p>The Ring fit nicely on the middle finger of my right hand where I found that particular finger shape to be better for wearing a ring than my index finger. It&apos;s more comfortable, overall, but it also doesn&apos;t get in the way like it would when I tried to wear it on my index finger.</p><p>Samsung recommends wearing it either on the index or middle fingers if you want to use the gesture feature, so this is right in line with expectations. Gestures are something unique to the Galaxy Ring and an advantage Samsung has over competitors, but they only work when paired with a supported Samsung Galaxy phone.</p>

<p>Aside from being exclusive to newer Galaxy phones, it&apos;s also worth noting that there are only two main gestures right now: take a photo, and stop an alarm on your phone. To perform either of these actions, you&apos;ll double-tap your ring-wearing finger and thumb together in the air as if you&apos;re pinching something twice.</p><p>While these are cool to use in <em>very</em> specific circumstances, they&apos;re not product-selling features by any means.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Ring's two most unique features are gesture support and the ability to remotely find a lost ring, but both only work with certain Samsung Galaxy phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung also supports a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring">find my ring</a>" feature that works identically to other Samsung Galaxy devices. Open the Galaxy Wearables app, then tap <em>find</em> on the main menu. The app will give you a rough location of where the Ring is—or where it was last detected if it&apos;s not in your general vicinity—including a handy GPS map using Bluetooth for local location, but this functionality <strong>only </strong>works on Samsung Galaxy phones.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring doesn&apos;t vibrate or make noise, which means that it doesn&apos;t support notifications. That also means that it&apos;s a little difficult to find, especially if it fell between the couch cushions or rolled under something like a fridge or stove.</p><p>The app lets you rapidly blink the lights on the Galaxy Ring&apos;s sensors but this is only useful at night or in a dark room. The lights simply aren&apos;t bright enough to be seen during the day or in any type of bright lighting.</p>

<p>As I previously noted, this functionality <strong>only </strong>works on Samsung Galaxy phones. The Samsung Find app is exclusive to the Galaxy Store.

The best you&apos;ll be able to do with a non-Samsung phone is blink the Ring&apos;s lights which, as I pointed out, is mostly useless.</p><p>Still, other smart rings don&apos;t have a "find my" feature at all, so any way to find your lost Ring is an advantage for Samsung, even with its limitations.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons to choose a smart ring over a smartwatch is battery life. Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> need to be charged daily, while some fitness-focused options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965 </a>can last 1-3 weeks depending on how often you use GPS tracking.</p><p>My Galaxy Ring lasted 6-7 full days on any given charge. In the initial review, I noted that the Ring had 10% left at the end of the 6th day, which is plenty to still perform sleep tracking that night.</p><p>The remaining battery percentage can be tracked both on the Galaxy Wearables app and with the Ring itself. Just take off the ring and look at the indicator LEDs inside for a few seconds. They&apos;ll flash green indicating the battery percentage left in 25% increments. Four flashes mean between 75%-100% battery is left, three flashes for 50%-75%, etc.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>When you wear a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch at the same time, the Ring's health sensors go to sleep to save battery life. To me, this makes no sense at all. It should be the other way around.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung highlights that a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch can be used in conjunction for the most accurate health tracking and better overall battery life. But it feels like Samsung got things backwards with the battery portion of this equation.</p><p>When you wear a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch at the same time, the Ring&apos;s health sensors go to sleep to save battery life. To me, this makes no sense at all. It should be the other way around since you normally need to charge a smartwatch every day, whereas the Galaxy Ring has week-long battery life with normal use.</p><p>Samsung seriously needs to rethink how this works, as it would make a lot more sense to save battery life on the watch by using the Ring&apos;s health tracking sensors, instead.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Ring has true week-long battery life, and the included charging case works like a wireless earbuds case for easy travel.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best earbuds</a>, you&apos;ll charge your Galaxy Ring using the included charging case. This case has its own battery with enough capacity for several full Ring charges. It also charges via USB-C, so it&apos;s convenient to quickly charge and take on the go with you if you need it.</p><p>The case itself is a bit tech chic, with a transparent, flashy design including a ring of LEDs that illuminate when opening the hinge. This ring is used to display the case&apos;s remaining battery life, and tapping the button can also initiate pairing.</p><p>Like many Samsung devices these days, though, charging the Galaxy Ring is abysmally slow. A 30-minute charge resulted in a measly 50% Ring charge, while it took a full hour to top-up the tiny ~20mAh battery. No doubt, Samsung makes the charging so painfully slow in an effort to prolong battery longevity but at least you only need to charge it once per week.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>I ran into several situations where the case wouldn't charge the Ring at all, only to find out I had it upside down on the dock, which seems an odd design for a ring.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not only that, but I ran into <em>several</em> situations where the ring wouldn&apos;t charge at all, even when I thought I had properly mounted it in the case. Part of the confusion comes in the case design. When you open it, the LED ring inside lights up to give you a view of the battery percentage of the case itself. But I often mistook this for the Ring&apos;s battery percentage since the LED stays illuminated after I dock the ring.</p><p>So instead of charging the Ring, I&apos;d come back after an hour or two to find that nothing at all happened. In all events of this happening, flipping the ring over fixed the charging issue. I&apos;m not sure why charging the ring seems to work on one side but you&apos;ll need to pay extra close attention to the app to ensure your ring is actually charging in the case, denoted by a normal charging lightning bolt icon in the Galaxy Wearables app.</p>

<p>I hate wearing a watch to sleep. It&apos;s not something I do outside of the occasional smartwatch review, so the Galaxy Ring seemed like an ideal way to track sleep. It&apos;s <em>incredibly </em>comfortable to wear to bed.</p><p>If you&apos;ve worn a Galaxy Watch to sleep before, expect the same kind of metrics from a Galaxy Ring. That, in and of itself, is a triumph. A smaller, more comfortable device that can get the same kinds of readings for sleep data as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is truly a fantastic proposition.</p><p>The problem is that Samsung&apos;s sleep data isn&apos;t considered the best in the industry by any means, and bands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0</a> or smaller smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> deliver far more accurate data.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.26%;"><img id="AJtU6yrmwmhjdkyn7QCXuP" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-auto-vs-pixel-watch-2-sleep-01.jpg" alt="Comparing sleep tracking data between the Samsung Galaxy Ring and the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJtU6yrmwmhjdkyn7QCXuP.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1749" height="1946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.26%;"><img id="Akq5hXnQbWEraUjpMczB8Q" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-auto-vs-pixel-watch-2-sleep-02.jpg" alt="Comparing sleep tracking data between the Samsung Galaxy Ring and the Google Pixel Watch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Akq5hXnQbWEraUjpMczB8Q.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1749" height="1946" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Of course, much of this is going to come down to alignment and fit. Smartwatches need to be worn fairly tightly in order to get an accurate reading. Move around too much at night with a loose wristband and you might as well just delete the tracking data. Likewise, a Ring that spins or wobbles a lot on your finger won&apos;t do you much good.</p><p>For this reason, I tried to wear the Ring on several different finders but it didn&apos;t seem to affect overall accuracy much. It also doesn&apos;t support sleep apnea tracking like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a>, which means any data it delivers is largely pedestrian in nature. In other words, while this is a nice sleep-tracking device, I wouldn&apos;t take its results as Gospel.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sleep tracking was largely inaccurate compared to the best smartwatches, and the Galaxy Ring doesn't support advanced measurements like sleep apnea detection.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Samsung Health app is chock full of great little details and well-presented information, from the prominent sleep score to the individual metrics and easy-to-read graph that break your sleep down into awake, light, REM, and deep sleep patterns.</p><p>Below the sleep score is the breakdown of what metrics fueled the score, including sleep time, physical recovery, restfulness, mental recovery, and sleep cycles. I&apos;m a very light sleeper by nature, and the Ring picked that up handily.</p><p>But while I initially felt good about the overall sleep score, diving into the data made me feel less confident in it. I often noticed blips in the graph where no data was collected at all. I assume some of this is down to fit but, like I said previously, I tried wearing it on several different fingers—many of which were an even tighter fit than my middle finger—and still found these weird lapses in data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.15%;"><img id="6qgZewbeA5RuAurtuAHkJT" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-sleep-data.jpg" alt="Looking at all the sleep data gathered from a Samsung Galaxy Ring in the Samsung Health app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qgZewbeA5RuAurtuAHkJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1109" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other data points like blood oxygen and skin temperature while sleeping should also be taken with a grain of salt. Skin temperature readings from a finger will be different from a wrist or even a torso band because of their location — some people like heavy, heat-trapping blankets, while others may put their hands under a pillow, both of which could produce inaccurate readings.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung provides lots of sleep tracking data but I'm not sure I trust its accuracy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Daily energy score is calculated by combining all the available metrics, but my number was never quite accurate because the Ring never successfully detected any of my workouts at the gym, which you&apos;ll read about below. If I were going to plan my day around that energy score number—which is the entire purpose of such a score—it&apos;s likely I&apos;d have a less active day than I should.</p><p>The Energy Score metric isn&apos;t exclusive to Samsung phones, thankfully, but you&apos;ll only get the Galaxy AI-powered summary at the top when you pair it with specific Samsung phones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6YWib-kr4">One YouTuber</a> showed how the Galaxy Ring lines up with other bands and watches, putting it in line with the rest of the Galaxy Watch line and right in the middle of most other sleep and fitness-tracking wearables. In short, it&apos;s not bad, but it&apos;s not great, either.</p>

<p>My biggest disappointment with the Galaxy Ring revolves around fitness tracking. I never expected this to replace a smartwatch because of the lack of a screen—I primarily wear a smartwatch while working out to monitor my heart rate—but Samsung&apos;s software is seriously lacking some necessary fitness tracking requirements and it makes it nearly useless at a gym.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If your workouts involve more than just walking or running, don't even bother using the Galaxy Ring.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While going on a neighborhood walk or a hike, heart rate tracking seemed to be accurate compared to my Pixel Watch 2. I was pleasantly surprised at how effortless and transparent tracking was. I also found that the Galaxy Ring was dead-on accurate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">when using it to track steps</a>, which isn&apos;t something I can say about the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>First off, if you&apos;re not a runner or don&apos;t plan to use the Ring to track a walk or a hike, don&apos;t bother getting one. Automatic workouts are only supported for walking or running, and even then, I found that automatic tracking only seemed to work when I walked or ran outside. Even then, shorter 400m runs at the gym—including outdoor runs—were rarely automatically detected.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>During a Spartan Race, the time, distance, and tracked heart rate were all wrong on the Galaxy Ring.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s look at the results from my Spartan Race above. Since there&apos;s no way to manually track with a Galaxy Ring, I only have whatever it automatically tracked. During the race, I wore the Samsung Galaxy Ring and Google Pixel Watch 2 on my right hand, while the OnePlus Watch 2 was on my left hand.</p><p>The first problem with the Galaxy Ring is the activity time tracked. My actual race time was one hour 22 minutes. Both watches tracked for an hour and a half because I manually started them before the race started while I was waiting at the starting line, but the Galaxy Ring&apos;s automatic tracking comes 13 minutes short of my actual movement time.</p><p>The second problem is the distance logged. This Spartan Race was the 5k version which equates to 3.1 miles. The Galaxy Ring thought I ran 4.15 miles.</p><p>Third is the quality of the data itself. Since the Ring didn&apos;t properly track the entire race, the graph technically gets cut off roughly 4/5ths of the way through, but we can at least compare the rest of it. At first, there appears to be no correlation at all between the Galaxy Ring and the two watches, however, a closer inspection shows come similarities.</p><p>But even with similar peaks and lows, the numbers from the Galaxy Ring aren&apos;t even close to the two watches I wore.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is the polling rate. Heart rate data is only recorded every ten minutes — to save battery — and this doesn&apos;t seem to be often enough to detect a workout successfully. Samsung uses other sensors inside to help with detection but they didn&apos;t seem to do much good for me.</p><p>I go to the gym an average of four times per week—each visit is an hour-long workout at a CrossFit-style gym—but all I saw from the Ring was a blip or two on the heart rate graph showing an elevated number. That was during the best of times. At the worst of times, the Ring didn&apos;t grab any heart rate data during my workouts at all.</p><p>There&apos;s also no way to manually start a workout, which was unbelievable to me.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Ring is not a good workout tracking device, but it sure counts steps incredibly accurately.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When I asked Samsung about this, I was told that starting a manual workout from the Samsung Health app should solve my problems. Unfortunately, this didn&apos;t work. Any manual workout started from the Samsung Health app never recorded any Ring data. All I got was a generic calorie burn value relative to the workout I chose and the length of the workout.</p><p>In other words, I might as well have not even bothered bringing the Galaxy Ring to the gym.</p><p>Other smart rings like the Oura Ring Gen 3 do automatic workout detection far better and will regularly detect a workout, then allow you to select its type <strong>after</strong> the workout was completed. No smart ring is a proper smartwatch replacement for gym-style workouts but Samsung could have done <em>a lot</em> better with the Galaxy Ring&apos;s workout tracking functionality.</p><p>All in all, I&apos;m not inclined to recommend this Ring as a serious fitness-tracking tool.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> is a better overall buy than the Galaxy Ring. It&apos;s $50 less than the Galaxy Ring and, unlike Oura, has no subscription cost. Our Wearables reviewer Michael Hicks found the sleep tracking data to be quite accurate — unlike my experience with the Galaxy Ring. It even has AFib detection, something that&apos;s vitally important in a 24/7 wearable. The downside is that active fitness tracking isn&apos;t any better than the Galaxy Ring.</p><p>Another excellent alternative is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Smart Ring Gen 2</a>, which weighs in at $299 and features a unique squircle design. Battery life is 3-4 days longer than the Galaxy Ring, it offers sleep apnea detection, and RingConn offers covers for its rings which can prevent damage while using it during workouts or other times you may be worried about it getting scuffed up. It doesn&apos;t give you a "readiness score" like some other rings but I found those kinds of scores to be largely useless, anyway.</p><p>Of course, no smart ring review would be complete without mentioning the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, a ring that feels like a better overall buy for folks who are more serious about fitness tracking with a smart ring. Oura&apos;s software does a better job of automatically detecting workouts and gives you far more options for categorization and tracking than Samsung. The big downside is that you&apos;ll need a $6/month subscription to access that data.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a nice-looking ring that does more than look pretty.</li><li>You want a smart ring without the expensive subscription.</li><li>Casual 24/7 health tracking is more important to you than focused fitness or sleep tracking.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a serious fitness-tracking device.</li><li>Your workouts involve more than just walking or running.</li><li>You're trying to replace a smartwatch with a smart ring.</li></ul>
<p>On the surface, the Samsung Galaxy Ring looks like a fantastic first-generation effort. It provides lots of data and features without a monthly subscription requirement. The hardware is sleek, and it&apos;s comfortable to wear all day, which is especially important for sleep tracking and automatic exercise detection.</p><p>But the health tracking features feel amateur by nearly every measure. Automatic workout tracking is limited in scope to just walking or running and, even then, only works well when doing these activities for long periods <em>and</em> outdoors. Sleep tracking is comfortable but not nearly as accurate as a good smartwatch. Some data is even restricted to users who pair the ring with a Galaxy phone that has Galaxy AI built-in.</p><p>While the hardware is stellar, the fitness tracking experience simply isn&apos;t ready for primetime. The amount of data you get is superb, but the quality of that data is questionable. Technology enthusiasts will likely be thrilled with the tech packed in the ring, but anyone serious about quality fitness or sleep tracking should look elsewhere.</p><p>Smart rings are the ideal form factor, but Samsung&apos;s overall execution leaves a lot to be desired. Even as a 24/7 health tracker, other rings do it better because the Galaxy Ring is missing features like AFib or sleep apnea detection. If I had spent $400 of my own money on this ring, I would have returned it already.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was just released on August 22nd, but you can already score a whopping $400 discount AND six months of free wireless coverage when you bundle the purchase of the phone with any six-month data plan at Mint. It's easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">best Google Pixel 9 deals</a> I've seen since the phone was first unveiled earlier this month, but don't expect it to be around for long. </p>

It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/6810506/"><strong>Mint has dropped an identical offer on the larger Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong></a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1e720f4-a69c-4b11-a3c4-1d3c933b3e09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Thanks to this deal, you can get Google&apos;s latest flagship phone alongside an <em>entire year</em> of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $489 when you pay upfront (or $21 per month if you use affirm). Even if you sign up for Mint&apos;s most-expensive Unlimited plan, you&apos;re still looking at a max upfront payment of $579. That&apos;s over $200 less than you&apos;d pay if you bought the unlocked Pixel 9 by itself, and that&apos;s not even considering the value of covering your phone bill for a year. </p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile isn&apos;t a slouch when it comes to coverage either. Owned and operated by T-Mobile (and famously endorsed by Ryan Reynolds), Mint operates with a simple buy-in-bulk plan system that gives you access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, on the other hand, comes packed with Google&apos;s latest AI-powered technology, excellent cameras, and the efficiency of the Tensor G4 chipset. You also get seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone long after you say goodbye to Mint (if you decide to do so).</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 doesn't really stray all that far from past Pixel Watches' template, aside from some overdue updates to the display.

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra delivers perks like better GPS accuracy, extra heart rate LEDs, a brighter display, and longer software support. But people used to typical smartwatches won't miss upgrades they've never had before, and not everyone will want to spend so much on a smartwatch, no matter how durable and long-lasting it is.</p></p>

<p>Google doesn&apos;t sell a premium equivalent to the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, but if you buy the 45mm Google Pixel Watch 3 LTE, the price jumps to $499 — just $150 less than the Ultra. That gap is small enough that many of you will consider upselling yourselves to the Ultra, or cutting back to the Pixel Watch while keeping cellular support.</p><p>Both of these watches are, essentially, fitness watches. The Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s upgrades are meant to help it survive in rugged conditions and give you better HR and GPS data while you train. The Pixel Watch 3 isn&apos;t built for roughing it, but its Premium workouts and new cardio load score tailor it towards indoor <em>and</em> outdoor athletes.</p><p>This Pixel Watch 3 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra guide will break down every key upgrade Samsung&apos;s fancy flagship watch offers, while also exploring where Google&apos;s cheaper watch comes ahead. Both rank among our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">favorite Android watches</a>, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra appeals with its durability and longevity, while the Pixel Watch 3 provides better comfort and unique software perks.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-with-pixel-buds-pro-2-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AM58k4uyAjAsNjDAzKe5tG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is a massive, thick smartwatch with a striking titanium bezel surrounding the display, only available in one 47mm case size. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> has 41mm and 44mm options, both of which have edge-to-edge displays that round off on the sides, making it more casually sleek and much less rugged.</p><p>Although Samsung&apos;s spec sheet falsely claims the Ultra measures slightly thinner than the Watch 3, it actually measures about 16mm thick once you include the sensor array, while Google&apos;s watch is about 3–4mm thinner.</p><p>Although the Galaxy Watch Ultra case by itself is nearly half as large as the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, each watch&apos;s true weight will vary based on which band material and size you choose. The 41mm Pixel Watch 3 — the same size as the Watch 2 — should weigh 55g with the smaller Active band or 63g with the larger band; the 45mm Watch 3 would weigh 61g or 69g, in theory. The Galaxy Watch Ultra with the Marine Band, which has a similar elastomer material, weighs 93g.</p><p>Both watches use a proprietary band system. Samsung has you slide and click bands directly into the slot, or press a small button on either bottom side to release them; Google uses a snap-and-tuck method that takes a little more getting used to, and releasing the bands with the side button is more finicky. Of the two, Samsung&apos;s is a bit easier to manage if you like to change out straps frequently.</p><p>Your old Pixel Watch 1 or 2 bands are compatible with the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, but not the 45mm Pixel Watch 3. The 47mm Galaxy Watch Ultra also requires its own standalone bands, as it isn&apos;t compatible with Watch 7 bands.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-side-view.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its Marine band" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaWFFCja96ECf6t6Bwb82M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google originally used stainless steel for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> but swapped to a less-premium aluminum for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> and Watch 3. While it&apos;s IP68 dust- and water-resistant like most smartwatches, the Watch 3 has no official rating to handle shocks and drops. Its Gorilla Glass 5 protection isn&apos;t as strong as the sapphire glass you get on many watches, and the design itself leaves the side glass vulnerable if you bonk your wrist against something. You may want a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p>With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you have an elevated titanium bezel that prevents scratches against flat surfaces and a sapphire-glass layer as a backup. Samsung had the Ultra pass MIL-STD-810H tests for "high/ low temperatures, altitude, humidity, immersion, salt, fog, dust, vibration, and drops." Its 10ATM rating is double the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s 5ATM rating, making it better suited for high-speed water sports.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra will appeal to fans of large, rugged watches like the Garmin Fenix or Amazfit T-Rex series, but may intimidate people with smaller wrists. We wish it came in a smaller display size, as the Pixel Watch 3 does.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 has a crown and a secondary button. The crown is unchanged from past models, and while many people prefer crowns for tactile, exact controls, others dislike relying on them.</p><p>Your alternative with the Galaxy Watch Ultra is its digital touch "bezel" around the display edge; if you slide your finger along it, you&apos;ll scroll through tiles or menus quickly, without any swipes or finger-twisting required. It&apos;s useful in normal settings but can be a bit inexact, especially on the go or with sweaty fingertips during a workout. Many people prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for its physical rotating bezel, but the Ultra&apos;s digital bezel prevents it from getting any heavier.</p><p>Instead, the Galaxy Watch Ultra gives you three buttons, one more than the standard Watch 7. We wish the middle Quick Button <em>was</em> a crown, but it does at least give you an easy shortcut to pause or restart workouts, or to trigger the emergency siren.</p>

<p>One of the biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 3 vs. 2 upgrades</a> is to its display. Google shrunk the thick display border, doubled the nits of brightness from 1,000 to 2,000, and gave the Watch 3 a 60Hz refresh rate that can dip as low as 1Hz to save battery life in specific instances. Depending on the case size, you get a 1.2-inch or 1.4-inch display with about 320 pixels per inch.</p><p>Despite these upgrades, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra display still wins for size (1.5 inches) and brightness (3,000 nits). It also reportedly has a 60Hz refresh rate, though Samsung doesn&apos;t advertise whether it can dip as low as Google&apos;s LTPO tech, and a similar 320ppi. The biggest downside, of course, is how big it is: You won&apos;t find a secondary 1.3-inch option, like you get with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hardware-and-battery-life-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: Hardware and battery life</h2>
<p>Google uses the Qualcomm-made, 4nm Snapdragon Wear 5100, which has four Arm Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, plus its own Cortex M33 coprocessor. It&apos;s a common CPU for many Android watches besides the Pixel Watch 3, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>.</p><p>Samsung gave the Watch Ultra its own 3nm Exynos W1000 chip, which has four Arm Cortex-A55s (1.5GHz) and one Cortex-A78 (1.6GHz). It&apos;s difficult to say if Samsung&apos;s chip is better or worse. The Exynos W1000 can&apos;t hit the same speeds, but 3nm chips are generally more power-efficient, the Cortex-A55 is the next-gen core after the A53, and it has one extra core to better spread tasks around.</p><p>Generally speaking, you won&apos;t find too much of a performance difference between the two, especially since both have 2GB of RAM. They also share the same 32GB of storage for apps and playlists.</p>

<p>Both watches support the same Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards, along with NFC contactless payments — though the Galaxy Watch Ultra supports both Samsung and Google Wallet.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra comes with built-in LTE, while the Pixel Watch 3 makes you pay $100 extra for it in either size. Google bundles in two years of free cellular data through Google Fi, though you only get a paltry 500MB of data before the download speed is capped. For things like phone-free calling and unlimited music streaming, you&apos;ll need to add the Watch 3 to your phone carrier plan.</p><p>One unique perk of the Pixel Watch 3 is its ultra-wideband (UWB) support, which enables the Watch Unlock feature and lets you use the watch as a digital car key (depending on which car you own).</p><p>With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you get the benefit of dual-band GPS tracking, which triangulates your position using both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. Having reviewed the Ultra&apos;s accuracy myself, it does extremely well, on par with a dual-band Garmin watch. We&apos;ve yet to test the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s accuracy, but any GPS-only watch will struggle if the signal is blocked by buildings, foliage, or other obstacles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yJpxcmnEYnSeTpZvVH4fGb" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-45mm-nest-video-doorbell-tile-2.jpg" alt="Audio Controls from Nest Video Doorbell on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJpxcmnEYnSeTpZvVH4fGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main Galaxy Watch Ultra upside over the Pixel Watch 3 is its battery life. It&apos;s rated to last 60 hours with the always-on display (AOD) active, while the Pixel Watch 3 only has a 24-hour estimate in the same conditions. That&apos;s 2.5x the battery life.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to test the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s longevity for ourselves, but you&apos;re assured of having to charge it once a day, or more frequently if you use functions like always-listening Google Assistant or daily GPS tracking. We&apos;ve heard suggestions that the 45mm Watch 3 might last slightly longer because of its extra capacity, but we can&apos;t be certain of this.</p><p>With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, we&apos;ve tested its longevity for ourselves; it had battery drain issues at launch that made it unreliably short-lived, but a post-launch update fixed this issue, and now it consistently matches or beats Samsung&apos;s 60-hour estimate. You&apos;ll have much more peace of mind knowing that it likely won&apos;t die on you while out and about.</p><p>As for charging speed, the Galaxy Watch Ultra has about the same speed as the Pixel Watch 3, but it still takes 1.5x to 2x as long because it has so much extra capacity. You&apos;ll have your Pixel Watch 3 topped off in an hour or so, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra usually needs two hours.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-health-sensors-2">Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra: Health sensors</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both watches track your heart rate and stress continuously, along with passive irregular heart rhythm (AFib) and high/low HR warnings. At night, they&apos;ll detect your blood oxygen levels, breathing rate, skin temperature, sleep duration and stages, and nightly energy recovery. You can also actively check for heart health issues with the ECG function.</p><p>Google and Samsung both promise that the Pixel Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch Ultra are their most accurate watches yet for heart rate. The Pixel Watch 3 has the same HR sensor as before, but with a new algorithm to better convert readings into correct data while running. We&apos;ll have to test this claim for ourselves, of course. The Galaxy Watch Ultra adds an extra nine LEDs compared to past Galaxy Watches (13 total), and it did better in our heart rate accuracy test compared to the Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p>In terms of unique functions, the Pixel Watch 3 has an electrical sensor to measure skin conductance (cEDA) for body response tracking; in other words, it determines your body&apos;s stress during the day and your recovery at night. Most watches use heart rate variability (HRV) to determine this, but this Fitbit tech claims to be more exact.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse.jpg" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 is the first Google device to feature the Loss of Pulse feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1900" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, Google has a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection/">Loss of Pulse Detection</a> feature to detect cardiac arrest and automatically call 911 if needed. We certainly can&apos;t test this, but like having this as a safety measure.</p><p>Samsung has its unique Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), which imitates a smart scale by sending electrical signals through your body to estimate your body fat and muscle percentages. It is useful, in theory, but we&apos;ve found the readings to be unreliable compared to smart scale data in our tests.</p><p>Plus, Samsung&apos;s redesigned health sensor suite has new LED colors meant to track new data like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">advanced glycation end products (AGEs) index</a>, aka products in your bloodstream that signal health problems. Unfortunately, this AGEs Index feature appears to give every user the same high-AGE score, making it useless as a biomarker. We hope this is something Samsung will improve over time.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra will receive four years of Wear OS version updates and four years of security updates. We didn&apos;t see a specific software promise with the Pixel Watch 3, but Google has previously promised three years of software support for Pixel Watches.</p><p>Either watch nets you access to new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> features, though Samsung has its own One UI 6 Watch skin on top of Wear OS 5. Google gave the Pixel Watch 3 unique app tools like Google TV controls, Nest Doorbell live feeds on your watch, and a Pixel Recorder app; some features will be Pixel exclusive, but others may come to the Galaxy Watch Ultra later.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 relies on Fitbit for your health and fitness data, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra uses Samsung Health. Samsung added a new daily Energy Score that&apos;s quite similar to Fitbit&apos;s Daily Readiness Score, using the same collected data. </p><p>Fitbit charges a Premium fee for certain wellness reports and AI insights, but gives you data like your Cardio Load and Target Load for free, judging how hard you&apos;ve worked out across multiple workouts and whether you&apos;ve trained enough to improve your fitness level over time. Samsung&apos;s fitness data doesn&apos;t have any long-term analysis at the moment, though you can export it to other apps like Strava to get this.</p>

<p>As we said from the outset, these are two fitness watches that take different approaches towards the same goal. Some athletes will prefer the Ultra for the assurance it&apos;ll never die during a workout; others will want a watch that&apos;s skinnier and lighter while weight training or running.</p><p>We gave the Galaxy Watch Ultra a glowing review, and are impressed with the Pixel Watch 3 thus far, so both should give you a high level of quality. The Pixel Watch 3 is much more accessible due to its price, however. It&apos;s harder to recommend the Galaxy Watch Ultra unless you have a real need for military-grade durability, better GPS tracking, or longer battery life than the Pixel Watch 3 can give.</p>
