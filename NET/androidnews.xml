It hasn't been out very long, launching in June and going on sale the following month, but it's already seen some impressive sales. None were quite as impressive as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-2024-256gb-unlocked-hot-pink/6583831.p?skuId=6583831">current Black Friday discount</a>, which slashes $250 off the retail price of the phone and brings it to a new low.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> originally launched for $999, but Best Buy brings that down to just $749 if you buy it unlocked.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a great flip phone with a good camera and functional cover screen that lets you use apps without opening your phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You're not a fan of Motorola's software or you want more consistent and timely software updates. In which case, you should consider this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ditch-your-boring-phone-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-now-more-than-usd300-off">Galaxy Z Flip 6 deal</a>.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">reviewing the Razr Plus 2024</a>, the phone has remained my daily driver, and I can honestly say that I truly love this phone. The Snapdragon chip is snappy, the cameras are pretty good, and the large cover screen is a joy to use. Not to mention, battery life is surprisingly great, and I don't find myself struggling to keep a charge like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">2023 Razr Plus</a>. It also helps that the phone charges fast and supports wireless charging.</p><p>Since owning the phone, Motorola has updated it with support for Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and has even added its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/moto-ai-open-beta-program">Moto AI</a> features for users to beta test. The phone is also slated to get Android 15 at some point, so it already feels like the phone is adding more value the more I use it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> may be the more powerful phone, but the Razr Plus 2024 feels like the true kind of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> this year.</p><p>And if you want to know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">what color Razr Plus 2024 you should buy</a>, I'm partial to the green model, which has a nice grassy feeling to it.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is pushing a second Android 15 update to its 12 series phone, which brings in the company's promised AI features.</li><li>The OnePlus 12 is picking up several features under the "AI Retouch" and "AI Writing Suite" monikers for photo reworks and writing assistance, respectively.</li><li>The first Android 15 update was pushed early in November; however, OnePlus highlighted that its AI features were still in testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another update is starting to roll out for a past-gen OnePlus device that makes good on the company's promise.</p><p>The Chinese OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1738602115003056133">posted its changelog</a> for its second Android 15 update for the OnePlus 12 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/11/oneplus-12-second-android-15-update.html">Android Headlines</a>). OnePlus notes that the update that's rolling out (vCPH2573_15.0.0.305) is getting its start in India <em>before </em>arriving in North America, Europe, and other Global areas next week. Additionally, the update concerns OxygenOS 15 users, leaving those with OxygenOS 14 to wait as the company is "working to provide the update for you soon!"</p><p>More importantly, this update is bringing a couple of AI-based features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>Thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, users will soon have access to AI Retouch. OnePlus states this will let users enhance the clarity of a "cropped, distant, or low-quality" picture. AI Retouch also includes "Unblur," which is said to assist in restoring colors, lighting in blurry photos, and other important details.</p><p>Lastly, "Remove Reflections" uses AI to remove unsightly mirroring effects found on glass for a "clearer more authentic" photo.</p><p>Additionally, the second Android 15 update brings AI Notes to the OnePlus 12. Kicking that off is the "AI Writing Suite" with tools to help you polish your drafts and "optimize" the AI's writing style to get the heavy work done for you. "Format" is said to bring your scattered notes into a more cohesive form while "Clean Up" removes "filler words" to facilitate more structured sentences.</p><p>OnePlus threw in support to instantly share live photos with iOS devices and the dependability of Bluetooth. The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Contacts can now be switched to a floating window.</li><li>Photos can now recognize boarding passes and add them to Google Wallet.</li><li>Apps in large folders can now be displayed in 3 × 3 grids.</li><li>Fixes an issue that might cause some apps to crash.</li><li>Fixes a display issue where some app icons might overlap with other elements when pulling down the Quick Settings in the Photos app after restarting the phone.</li><li>Integrates the November 2024 Android security patch to enhance system security.</li></ul>

<p>OnePlus initially pushed its major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">Android 15 upgrade</a> for its 2023 flagship early in November. The update started rolling out to many of the same regions as this second "incremental" patch. However, the original rollout only offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">the new features</a> that OnePlus worked on for OxygenOS 15. Specifically, the software' icons were improved with a softer, rounded visual appeal on the Home screen and within its Systems area.</p><p>The animations of OxygenOS 15 have been revamped to be more fluid in every aspect of the device. Several new gesture controls aid users who're multitasking with more intuitive controls.</p><p>What's more, OnePlus highlighted its lack of AI features for the device during that first update. The company stated that those tools were still in "testing" and would begin rolling out in November. We're nearly at the end, meaning those in the U.S. and other places will begin seeing them early in December.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for TWS earbuds with superb sound quality and ANC; you want a reliable charging case with USB-C and a lanyard loop; you can live with using AirPods on an Android phone.<br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want OS-level integration between your earbuds and your Android phone; you don't need ANC or advanced audio features.</p>
<p>I've extensively tested all the best TWS earbuds this year, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>. Before the latest Black Friday sales rolled around, I thought the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 were the best bang-for-your-buck pair of truly-wireless (TWS) earbuds on the market — whether you're an iOS or Android users. However, now that the AirPods Pro 2 are around $150, Apple's earbuds are clearly a better value.</p><p>The great thing about AirPods Pro 2 is that when it comes down to it, they're just Bluetooth earbuds. I've used these earbuds with Pixels and Galaxys, plus phones from OnePlus and Nothing. All you have to do is hold down the pairing button on the back of AirPods Pro 2 and connect to the earbuds to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a>. You only have to do this once; after that, AirPods Pro 2 connect automatically when you take them out of the case.</p><p>Nearly all of the Apple-exclusive AirPods Pro 2 features come to Android with the help of free apps on the Google Play Store. With capacitive stems, you can control ANC modes, volume, and playback directly from your earbuds. Best of all, AirPods really do have the best ANC quality of any in-ear headphones I've tested. At $154, I think even Android users should pick these up before time runs out on this deal.</p>

If you're considering picking up a Quest 3 this year, this is THE DEAL you've been waiting for.</p><p>This deal is for the 512GB Meta Quest 3 which <strong>was $650</strong> just two months ago. At $499, this headset is the same price as the old 128GB Meta Quest 3. Up until now, we only saw Best Buy and Amazon giving away gift cards with the Meta Quest 3S, which is a more budget-priced headset. The Quest 3 is Meta's top-tier headset and offers the best lenses on any VR headset and the highest resolution display on any Meta Quest to date.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi was spotted pushing its required 2024 flagship phone documents through the FCC for certification.</li><li>The files detail the Xiaomi 15 with HyperOS 2.0, 12/256GB, and 12/512GB RAM/storage configurations.</li><li>Xiaomi's SVP and president highlighted the benefits of the Snapdragon 8 Elite on the 15 series during its keynote in October with Qualcomm.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi is reportedly preparing to take its recent flagship phones global after a few certification appearances.</p><p>The Xiaomi 15 was spotted moving through the U.S. FCC certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/xiaomi-15-muncul-di-sertifikasi-fcc-pertanda-segera-rilis-global/">91Mobiles</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/11/global-xiaomi-15-variant-fcc.html">Android Headlines</a>). The listing states the device in question features model number 24129PN74G in preparation for a U.S. launch. Moreover, the Chinese OEM provided a few "remarks" about the upcoming device.</p><p>According to Xiaomi's file, the company submitted two EUT (end-user testing) devices to the FCC with varying RAM/storage configurations. There is one config with 12/256GB and another with 12/512GB. Elsewhere, the listing details the existence of HyperOS 2.0 installed on the device.</p><p>The post adds that the Xiaomi 15 in the U.S. will likely support several Bluetooth connectivity types, NFC, wireless power transfer, and GNSS. Its Wi-Fi bands will support 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 5GHz, per the database.</p><p>On the other hand, Android Headlines highlights the appearance of the Xiaomi 15 in the BIS, which handles devices moving through India. The model number is seemingly the name; however, Xiaomi most notably dropped the "G" (global) for an "I" for the respective country.</p>

<p>You may remember that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro</a> launched at the end of October. The devices hit the Chinese market as the first commercial phones to sport Qualcomm's suped-up Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. Curiously, the launch details left out a crucial aspect: the potential for a global launch. We were left in the dark <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">despite Xiaomi's appearance</a> during Qualcomm's Summit a few weeks before the phone's launch.</p><p>During the keynote, the SVP and president of Xiaomi, Adam Zeng discussed what folks could expect from the company moving forward. Among them was the Xiaomi 15 series, which Zeng said would be "the first" phones to sport the 8 Elite "globally." Now, while that didn't exactly happen — we got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-snapdragon-8-elite-global-launch">Nubia Z70 Ultra</a> first — Zeng detailed the chip's performance with its HyperCore technology.</p><p>The Xiaomi 15 series reportedly benefits from a 29.7% drop in power consumption and even cooler peak temperatures.</p><p>A launch date is still unknown, but the Xiaomi 15 could debut sometime in early 2025 without China's Pro model. The assumption comes from the FCC's listed RAM/storage configs, which are notably lower than the Pro's 16GB+1TB setup. That's what rumors say, so we'll have to see what happens officially in the future.</p>

Now you can learn why thanks to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D83J6JJ9"><strong>record-low Black Friday price of $47</strong></a>, valid for <em>all four</em> amazing colors.</p><p>Once your loved ones pull these out of their stockings and pop them into their ears they'll understand why I love them so much. Aside from the supremely comfortable fit, CMF Buds Pro 2 have <em>the coolest</em> case among any earbuds you'll find today. Why? That nifty silver dial you see in the picture above, of course.</p><p>That dial is more than just a fidget spinner — although you could always disable it and make it just that. It can be customized to do all sorts of things like play or pause, skip forward or backward, toggle your favorite voice assistant, answer calls, or just adjust the volume without having to look at your phone. It's both a button and a dial, so you can assign half a dozen different commands to it!</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a pair of ANC earbuds capable of high res audio with fun colors and a charging case that's filled to the brim with functionality you never expected was possible.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the best sound quality possible. These aren't bad at all but there's a reason some earbuds are $200 or more.</p><p>CMF Buds Pro 2 feature active noise cancelation that's great for noisy environments or long commutes, a feature that was once reserved for only the most premium earbuds around.</p><p>Each bud features a 60mAh battery inside which ensures that you'll get 10 hours of constant listening before having to charge them, too. Of course, docking them in that nifty charging case <em>charges</em> the buds, so it doesn't take long to drop them in for a top-up and keep listening throughout the day.</p><p>Even if these didn't come with such a great, functional case, they'd still be a superb choice because of the fit and quality. Thankfully, that case is more than just a cherry on top of this sweet deal: it's what truly sets CMF Buds Pro 2 apart from the pack!</p>

<hr>
<p>There's a lot of hype (and anticipation) surrounding One UI 7, but Samsung might've slipped up with this one.</p><p>Spotted by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1862397160500928948">Chunvn</a>, Samsung's Spanish website variant might've accidentally published its complete One UI 7 details early (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-7-features-3504147/">Android Authority</a>). The publication quickly jumped on things and managed to capture a series of videos before Samsung took it down.</p><p>The One UI 7-centric page highlighted several features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-portrait-studio-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Portrait Studio</a>. Neither of these features is new; however, the next OS upgrade is set to take them further. According to the page, One UI 7 will improve Sketch to Image by giving it "3D Cartoon, Sketch, and Watercolor" options. The brief video captured showcases the ability of a user to draw a simple, flat image before tapping "generate."</p><p>The example given seemingly shows the watercolor option selected. After a brief wait time, One UI 7's AI will produce your desired drawing. The website reportedly offered extra details, stating that a watermark would be added to anything "generated with AI." Moreover, edited images will become a resized product of "up to 12MP."</p><p>Portrait Studio seems primed to pick up options similar to Sketch to Image. The post states Samsung will provide "3D Cartoon, Cartoon, and Sketch" options alongside a "Live Effects" feature. The page reportedly stated Live Effects will add "depth" and "perspective."</p>

<p>The early One UI 7 highlights page also showcased the software's revamped icons, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">notifications and Quick Settings panel split</a>, and ongoing activity alert. We've seen most of this repeatedly; however, the ongoing alert is a large, pill-shaped icon nestled at the bottom of your device's lock screen.</p><p>It will seemingly give users a clear view of their lock screen — but notifications will likely take up the space under the date.</p><p>We've seen additional (supposed) One UI 7 features leaked previously, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">parental and AI-focused features</a>. However, with the latest accidentally posted One UI 7 page by Samsung, it seems these features are inbound. It was reported in October that the software would give parents better agency over their child's online safety. They would have tools to block websites alongside tools to cut off access to certain apps.</p><p>Samsung's accidental post seemingly confirms these features, as well as the additional AI features for Sketch to Image and Portrait Studio.</p><p>It seems like we've been waiting for One UI 7 forever — and the wait has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">only been extended</a> as Samsung pushed its beta back even more. Reports claim that the Korean OEM encountered additional problems within its software, which have forced it to delay the Beta Program until "the first week of December."</p>

<ul><li>Google first previewed "huddles," a quick way to start instant audio conversations in Google Chat, in 2023.</li><li>Huddles are now coming to Google Chat users in select Google Workspace tiers.</li><li>They are instant-on audio calls that Google says will help "reduce meeting fatigue" for workers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">Google Chat</a> is making quick conversations simpler with "huddles," which are audio-first calls that resemble a Slack feature of the same name. Huddles are instant-on, and will significantly reduce the friction between Google Chat and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-apps-original-version-is-officially-gone-for-good">Google Meet</a>. Instead of needing to switch from Chat to Meet to start a quick video call, users will now be able to start a huddle from Google Chat in an instant.</p><p>The feature was initially previewed in 2023, but it's only now rolling out to select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-material-design-smart-chips">Google Workspace</a> tiers. Business Starter, Standard, and Plus; Enterprise Starter, Standard, and Plus; Frontline Starter and Standard; Essentials, Enterprise Essentials, and Enterprise Essentials Plus; Nonprofits will all be able to use huddles in Google Chat.</p><p>Although huddles are clearly intended to be an audio-first method of communication, users can also share their screen or use video to get their message across. Additionally, the button for huddles in Google Chat is joined by options for phone calls and Meet video calls, so there are still plenty of options. Huddles are entirely powered by Google Meet, and are simply integrated with Chat. Google says that employees in workspaces that don't enable Google Meet can join huddles, but can't create them.</p>

<p>To start a huddle, click the <strong>Video</strong> icon in the Google Chat toolbar, which will open a dropdown menu. Here, you'll see options for <strong>Call</strong>, <strong>Meet</strong>, and <strong>huddle</strong>. Select the <strong>Start a huddle</strong> option to begin the call, which begins as audio-only. All members of the Google Chat space or chat will receive a message that reads: <strong>[user] has started a huddle, click “Join” to enter the huddle</strong>.</p><p>"Huddles help to reduce meeting fatigue for hybrid workers, and eliminates the need for lengthy discussions over email or in Chat," Google explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/09/huddles-in-google-chat.html" target="_blank">post</a> on the Google Workspace Blog. "Instead of jumping out of the conversation and into a meeting, huddles integrates directly and smoothly into the Chat experience."</p><p>This feature is rolling out now for users on rapid release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> domains. Users on Google Workspace domains with scheduled releases won't start seeing this feature until Jan. 6, 2025.</p>

How is the Pixel Tablet and a charging dock cheaper than the Pixel Tablet <em>with</em> the charging dock? Well, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZ84J/">this Black Friday deal</a>, the standalone Pixel Tablet without the speaker dock just got a $120 discount. When you throw in the $129 charging dock, it more or less evens out.</p><p>The standalone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> with 128GB of storage normally sells for $399, but if you get the bundle package with the charging dock, you're looking at $499. So, when you buy the two separately, you're spending $408 on both, which is a full $91 less than you would normally spend. Unfortunately, there's no deal on the charging dock, but you gotta grab your wins (and deals) where you can.</p><p>That said, if you want double the storage, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1SL9TW8/">Pixel Tablet (256GB) bundle deal</a> actually works out to be cheaper than buying them separately.</p>

<p>While the Pixel Tablet isn't the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a> around, it is one of our favorites, mainly because of its simplicity and the way it seems to seamlessly fit with the rest of Google's Pixel lineup. In lieu of a new Nest smart home display, the Pixel Tablet attempts to play double duty, which is where the speaker dock comes in to put the tablet in dock mode for easy access to smart home controls and more. It's actually pretty convenient.</p><p>What's more is that because it's a Pixel, many of your favorite features are available on the tablet. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> makes it incredibly easy to look up something on your screen. There's also the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/how-to-cast-music-and-videos-to-the-google-pixel-tablet">Hold close to cast</a>, which lets you easily transfer media from your Pixel phone to the tablet, just by bringing them close.</p><p>I've never used an Android tablet because I never saw much value in them, but I've honestly been pretty tempted to buy the Pixel Tablet for some time. That said, the price always held me back... until now.</p>
