                    <p><p><em><strong>Uninspired</strong></em></p>
<p>I'll be upfront and say that I don't like what Samsung is doing with its foldables; the Galaxy Z Fold 6 retains the same design as its predecessor, and that means you still get the same narrow cover screen that doesn't allow you to do much. As someone who uses the cover screen predominantly, the Z Fold 6 is a non-starter for my own use. That said, Samsung rolled out the usual yearly upgrades: the phone is more powerful, has better ingress protection, and comes with a slate of AI features. However, the fundamentals are unchanged, and you'll need to pay an additional premium this year — which just isn't worth it.</p></p>

<p>The Pixel Fold is an intriguing device if you want a foldable that's not tall and unwieldy. The 5.8-inch cover screen is great to use, and it unfolds to 7.6 inches — the same size as the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The quality of the panels is excellent, you get one of the strongest camera packages in this segment, and you get Google's clean software with a ton of useful extras. That said, the Pixel Fold is 54g heavier than Samsung's offering, it doesn't fold fully flat, and you can't buy it in most global markets.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-all-colors-01.jpg" alt="All three colors of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CdQudR4ncWEEmChybQ7aj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung doesn&apos;t like changing the design of its devices, and that&apos;s evident when you take a look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The foldable is a smidgen thinner and taller than its predecessor, but the overall design is identical. The only difference is that the cameras have slightly bigger rings encircling each module, but other than that, there&apos;s no telling that you&apos;re using Samsung&apos;s latest-gen foldable.</p><p>The other key difference is that the Z Fold 6 is lighter; at 239g, it is 16g lighter than its predecessor, and you can feel that when using the device. Samsung is also using the latest iteration of its Armor Aluminum chassis, and that should allow the Z Fold 6 to be resilient in daily use. The hinge isn&apos;t as smooth to articulate as the Magic V2 or other 2024 foldables I&apos;ve used, and it is quite stiff.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dkUzZMfxpGxDraJZ7LCkhd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-pink-back.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkUzZMfxpGxDraJZ7LCkhd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the addition of IP48 ingress protection gives the Z Fold 6 a distinct advantage in this category; most foldables — including the Pixel Fold — still have an IPX8 rating, and by adding dust resistance into the mix, the Z Fold 6 is able to withstand the elements just that little better.</p><p>Coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, the foldable isn&apos;t going to win any design awards, but Google nailed the fundamentals. It is great to hold and use (if a little wide), and it has the same caliber of build quality as the Z Fold 6. However, the Pixel Fold is one of the heaviest phones you can buy today — if not the heaviest overall. At 283g, it is a full 44g heavier than the Z Fold 6.</p><p>The biggest issue with the design of the Pixel Fold is that it doesn&apos;t fold fully flat, and that gets annoying in daily use. The Z Fold 6 has no such shortcomings, but the downside is that the crease is still noticeable — much more so than most other devices in this segment.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="7SoGBFmvKghzNGsEXppS8n" name="pixel-fold-mockup-displays-02.jpg" alt="Pixel Fold Mockup Displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7SoGBFmvKghzNGsEXppS8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In all measurable metrics, Samsung has the lead in this area; both the inner and outer panels of the Z Fold 6 get brighter than the Pixel Fold, and they get dynamic refresh that goes to 120Hz. But the problem is that Samsung continues to limit the usability of the cover screen, and the 6.3-inch outer screen is just too tall and narrow to get any meaningful work done.</p><p>This has been a constant source of annoyance in the past, and I thought Samsung would amend the situation with the Z Fold 6, but that wasn&apos;t the case. All other foldables have regular-sized outer panels that give you greater flexibility in this regard, just like the Pixel Fold. Although the device has a smaller 5.8-inch panel on the outside, it is much more usable thanks to its 17.4:9 ratio; it&apos;s just better to use to see emails and messaging clients.</p><p>Both devices get the same 7.6-inch inner screen, and the AMOLED panel on Samsung&apos;s offering has better colors and brightness, making it a great choice for streaming content and gaming.</p>

<p>Samsung has a clear edge when it comes to the hardware, and that&apos;s solely down to the use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Samsung uses a custom version of Qualcomm&apos;s silicon that&apos;s reserved for its devices, and it has slightly higher clocks than the regular model.</p><p>You get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage as standard on the Z Fold 6, along with Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, UWB, AptX HD codecs, and USB-C 3.2 connectivity. There isn&apos;t much missing in this area, and while I wanted Samsung to increase the battery size, the 4400mAh unit should last all day with medium use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yg5LpZqSpg2tuL2NynLvQK" name="google-pixel-fold-holding-reading.jpg" alt="Reading something on the large screen of the Google Pixel Fold with a Dbrand leather skin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yg5LpZqSpg2tuL2NynLvQK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google makes it clear that it doesn&apos;t offer the best internals on its devices, instead prioritizing AI use cases. As a result, the Tensor G2 on the Pixel Fold is distinctly second-rate, and while it is decent enough in daily use, the shortcomings are noticeable when you start running demanding games.</p><p>The Pixel Fold also falls behind in other areas; it uses UFS 3.1 flash storage, and there&apos;s no 1TB option available. Where it does come out ahead is battery life, with the 4821mAh battery able to deliver up to a day&apos;s worth of use consistently. Google also has a distinct advantage in the imaging side of things, and the Pixel Fold takes outstanding photos in just about any scenario.</p><p>It has a decent set of lenses as well, and when you add Google&apos;s camera wizardry, the Pixel Fold remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> around in this area. Samsung hasn&apos;t changed much with the Z Fold 6, and while it uses last year&apos;s sensors, tweaks to camera algorithms allow the device to take better photos in low-light situations.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-google-pixel-fold-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Google Pixel Fold: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RFNTxvf39ugoAQDyhaxmtc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6-AI-portrait-03.jpg" alt="Using the AI portraits feature on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RFNTxvf39ugoAQDyhaxmtc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I prefer Google&apos;s software, so it shouldn&apos;t be astonishing that I recommend the Pixel Fold out of these two devices. Samsung has a lot going on with One UI 6.1, and Galaxy AI is legitimately useful — the new drawing feature is undoubtedly cool. That said, the interface is starting to get bloated again, and it just doesn&apos;t have the fluidity that you get with most other manufacturers.</p><p>That said, Samsung is offering seven Android OS updates with the Z Fold 6, and that&apos;s in line with what you get on the Galaxy S24 models. While Google also has the same update policy with the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, the Pixel Fold will only receive two additional Android updates, and that&apos;s a shame.</p>

<p>Usually, I try to recommend one of the devices I&apos;m writing about in these versus posts, but that&apos;s hard to do here. The problem is that neither device is anywhere close to the best that this segment has to offer. Samsung is essentially unchallenged in North America, so it doesn&apos;t need to innovate with its foldable designs, and that is immediately evident when looking at the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Chinese brands offer much better hardware, sleeker designs, and outstanding cameras, but as they don&apos;t sell their foldables in the U.S., you&apos;re essentially left with limited options. If you are interested in a new foldable, I&apos;d suggest getting the OnePlus Open; it has two usable screens, terrific cameras, great software, and stellar battery life. And at $1,699, it undercuts both the Pixel Fold and Z Fold 6.</p><p>Out of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel Fold, I&apos;m inclined to recommend the latter; it has better battery life, and you get two usable screens. Obviously, the hardware isn&apos;t as powerful, and at 283g, it is considerably heavier, but the software is much better overall, and you get better battery life as well.</p>

<p>Samsung has plenty to offer with the Z Fold 6, but the $1,899 asking price makes it a non-starter. There just isn't enough in the way of upgrades to warrant that price, and if you must have a Samsung foldable, you should just get last year's Galaxy Z Fold 5 instead.</p></p>

<ul><li>Earlier today, Samsung unveiled a new lineup of wearables and foldable phones. </li><li>This includes the Galaxy Z Fold 6, with its side-mounted fingerprint scanner. </li><li>During the initial setup process, the Fold 6 seemingly no longer prompts users to register fingerprints for biometrics. </li></ul>
<p>With the official announcement out of the way, Samsung&apos;s summer lineup of products is making its way into the hands of reviewers, Android Central included. Shortly after Unpacked came to a close, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> landed on my doorstep. </p><p>Needless to say, I wasted little time getting it out of the box in order to get everything set up. Throughout the initial setup process, there was one thing that I noticed — the Fold 6 didn&apos;t prompt me to register any fingerprints or other biometrics. Instead, I was only prompted to enter the passcode from my previous phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s not like the Fold 6 doesn&apos;t have a fingerprint scanner, as it&apos;s built into the "Side" button embedded in the frame. This is the first time that I can remember when I wasn&apos;t prompted to either register a fingerprint or use face recognition. Thankfully, this was quickly remedied by jumping into the Security and Privacy settings, selecting Biometrics, and then following the on-screen steps.</p>

<p>What remains unclear is whether the option to set up fingerprints is being removed from the onboarding process. It&apos;s entirely possible that there&apos;s just a random bug that will be squashed with a proceeding update. In a lot of instances, companies release a "Day One" software patch, fixing things that might not be working right and couldn&apos;t be taken care of before shipments begin. </p><p>We&apos;ll be keeping an eye on this in the coming weeks to see if Samsung releases an update that "fixes" the lack of a prompt. If not, we have to ask whether this is a sign of bigger changes to come. </p>

<h2 id="there-apos-s-one-key-factor-to-consider-when-buying-the-galaxy-watch-7-2">There&apos;s one key factor to consider when buying the Galaxy Watch 7</h2>
<p>Samsung offers three shades of the Galaxy Watch 7, but it&apos;s crucial to know that not all colors are available for all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>&apos;s case sizes. The smaller 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 only comes in Green and Cream. Meanwhile, the larger 44mm Galaxy Watch 7 is available to buy in Green and Silver.</p><p>As you might have noticed, Green is a staple among both sizes of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Based on this, it&apos;s safe to assume that Samsung expects this to be a popular color. We can see why, because the olive green case along with the dark army green band is a handsome look on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>If you want lighter shades, you&apos;re forced to choose either Cream or Silver, depending on the watch size that matches your wrist. Feeling unhappy about the limited colorways of the Galaxy Watch 7? You could always consider getting the beefier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is available in three hues as well, but the selection is more generic. This isn&apos;t a bad thing. Dramatic colors make it harder to match bands and even more difficult to coordinate outfits. If you&apos;re curious, you can always check out all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-color-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-should-you-buy">colors of the Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p>

With an IP68 and 10ATM water resistance rating, you can take the Samsung Galaxy Ring snorkeling and swimming.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="this-is-what-you-can-and-can-apos-t-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-ring-2">This is what you can and can&apos;t do with the Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>&apos;s 10ATM (ATM meaning atmosphere) rating means it can withstand 100 meters of water pressure (328 feet) but should not be submerged that much. This IP rating is an IP68 rating, meaning the smart ring can be submerged underwater for about 30 minutes at a depth of 1.5 meters. You can take it with you to activities such as water sports, washing the dishes, taking a shower, swimming, and other shallow water activities. But it&apos;s best to avoid intense rapids or currents and activities such as scuba diving or high-impact jetskiing since those activities can surpass the amount of pressure the rating can handle.</p><p>You may come across different ATM ratings. For example, a 1ATM rating can only handle ten meters of water pressure, a 3ATM can resist 30 meters, and a 5ATM rating can resist 50 meters. Every ten meters will add an additional ATM of pressure on the wearable. This rating is more than enough if you get caught in the rain or want to shower with it. Remember that the 100-meter rating is based on static pressure in a controlled area and does not apply to dynamic pressure you can experience in certain intense jetski activities. Samsung says the ring is not suitable for high water pressure and diving.</p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that a 10ATM rating (like the one found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us" target="_blank">Amazfit Helio Ring</a>) can deteriorate over time due to drops, exposure to harsh chemicals, extreme weather, and poor handling. The ring&apos;s aging materials can also weaken the rating, so the longer you have the ring, the more careful you should be around water.</p><p>You can also help by drying the Samsung Galaxy Watch after it gets wet despite the 10ATM rating to ensure its rating lasts as long as possible. Drying it off after a good workout will also help keep your Samsung Galaxy Ring in good condition since the salt found in sweat can damage it over time. Furthermore, occasionally, having a professional inspect your ring is a great idea to see how the ATM rating is holding up. Whether you have one of the best intelligent rings or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches of 2024</a>, following the manufacturer&apos;s maintenance instructions will also help make the ATM rating last longer.</p><p>IP and ATM ratings are not the same since they measure different things. IP stands for Ingres Protection and measures how resistant a device is against solid particles such as dust (first number) and water (second number) in an IP68 rating, for example. ATM, on the other hand, measures the amount of water pressure a wearable can resist.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="how-many-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-receive-2">How many updates will the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 receive?</h2>
<p>Just like the Galaxy S24 models, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will pick up seven years of guaranteed Android and security updates. The phone comes with Android 14 out of the box, and it is eligible to receive the Android 21 update when that becomes available in 2031. Of course, this is considering Google still releases yearly Android updates by next decade. Even then, with the device running One UI 6.1 out of the box, it will get seven years&apos; worth of One UI and security updates in addition to the underlying Android version update.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-matches-google-apos-s-long-term-software-guarantee-2">Samsung matches Google&apos;s long-term software guarantee</h2>
<p>Google set a new standard for software updates by announcing that its devices will get seven guaranteed Android OS and security updates. This includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and even the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> has been added to that list, making it the only mid-range device to get software updates for that long.</p><p>Samsung, to its credit, matched Google&apos;s guarantee with the Galaxy S24 series, so the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> as well as the S24+ and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> will get seven Android OS updates alongside security patches. However, the mid-range Galaxy A devices aren&apos;t included, and Samsung still continues to offer four guaranteed updates to the likes of the Galaxy A55 and A35.</p><p>Considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is part of Samsung&apos;s flagship portfolio, the foldable will get a similar update guarantee as the Galaxy S series, so it will also pick up seven years of Android OS updates and security patches. That is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, and makes the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> when it comes to long-term software update guarantee.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="CMN3g8bacVNovP3dJXjtn7" name="galaxy-z-fold-3-style-shot.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMN3g8bacVNovP3dJXjtn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, there&apos;s the small matter of durability; it remains to be seen if the Z Fold 6 is actually usable up to seven years. Samsung guarantees 400,000 unlocks with the hinge, but the inherent design of the foldable means the chassis is prone to higher wear and tear — more so than a regular phone — and at this point, we just don&apos;t know how these devices will measure up in long-term use.</p><p>The only anecdote I can share in this regard is that my dad&apos;s two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> needed to have its outer panel switched out and the back cover changed. Samsung did a great job with the service, and even though the device was outside the one-year warranty, it didn&apos;t charge anything to fix the device. </p><p>The biggest issue is the plaster layer that protects the fragile panels; that tends to wear out after a year or so of regular use, and it isn&apos;t something you can change easily — unlike screen protectors on regular phones. That said, it remains to be seen how the Galaxy Z Fold 6 measures up in this regard; Samsung made changes to the chassis to allow it to last a longer duration, and that should make all the difference in extended use.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve just finished unpacking all Samsung had to offer at its summer event, but one notable player was missing: the Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s next iteration of Galaxy tablets was expected during its summer Unpacked event; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-confirmed-3457243/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> learned that it was still on the way. A statement obtained from a South African Samsung representative reads, "There will be a Tab S10 series."</p><p>They added that consumers can expect the next wave of tablets "before the end of the year." Specifics regarding its date or timeframe and details about the devices are still unknown officially.</p><p>Information regarding the next Tab S10 series has been light, but at least there was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">batch of leaked renders</a> to chew on. The images were described as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, which might feature a design language similar to last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>. </p><p>The next top-tier tablet is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display and could be ever-slightly thicker than its predecessor. Its dimensions are reportedly 326.4 x 208.6 x 5.45mm.</p>

<p>Kicking off July was a rumor theorizing that Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">drop the base version</a> of its Tab S10 series. Supposedly, the reasoning behind this is so Samsung can focus more on larger screen variants, which puts the Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra in the spotlight. Rumors claim the company is looking at starting its tablets at 12 inches and going up from there.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung might impose a dual-chip mentality on its Tab S10 series when it launches in various areas. Some regions may see a MediaTek SoC while others could snag Qualcomm&apos;s hardware. It&apos;s a trend consumers will be familiar with as Samsung did it with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>.</p><p>That same report claimed Samsung could launch its Tab S10 series in the "second half" of 2024, and we&apos;re now seeing similar confirmation.</p><p>Regardless, we have some time to wait and Samsung just launched several new devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-launches-with-ai-powered-fitness-tracking">Galaxy Ring</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-launch">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and the Watch 7.

<p>Samsung pioneered water resistance on foldables, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 takes things to a new level by adding IP48 certification. That means the device can be safely submerged in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes without any issues, and as it now has dust ingress as well, it is safeguarded against any solid objects greater than 1mm in diameter.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-know-about-the-water-resistance-of-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-2">What you should know about the water resistance of the Galaxy Z Flip 6</h2>
<p>Samsung has offered IPX8 certification on its foldables starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review">Flip 3</a>, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, it is kicking things up a notch by adding dust protection as well. The liquid part of the ingress protection rating is unchanged, and it continues to be the best around. The device can be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water — just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> — and it will be unscathed. That is an achievement in and of itself considering it is significantly more challenging to secure a foldable design against water ingress.</p><p>That said, the same caveats that are in effect with other water-resistant phones are valid here. When Samsung says its devices can be safely submerged in water, it is referring to fresh water; most natural water bodies contain salt water, and pools usually have chlorinated water.</p><p>If the Z Flip 6 comes into contact with any liquids other than fresh water — including pool water, any beverages, oil, sunscreen, or hand sanitizer — there are a few things you need to do. Samsung recommends you switch off the device and dunk it in fresh water, preferably for up to three minutes. After that, you should dry the device with a soft cloth (I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/3M-Perfect-Non-Scratch-Detailing-Cloths/dp/B0748MKN9R">these microfiber cloths</a> to clean my phones).</p><p>Another point to consider is that the various gaskets and seals that are used to secure the foldable against water ingress tend to wear out over time. This isn&apos;t something you need to worry about right away, but if you consistently use your device in a situation where it comes into contact with water, I&apos;d recommend taking it to a Samsung service center after about a year of use to see how the ingress protection is holding up.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-the-difference-between-ip48-and-ip68-2">What&apos;s the difference between IP48 and IP68?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> come with IP68 rating as standard, but you don&apos;t see that on foldables, which usually get IPX8 instead. With the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung is introducing IP48 as standard, and that&apos;s a big deal. The two numbers following the IP designation relate to dust and water ingress; regular phones are usually protected against dust and water ingress, and higher the number, better the protection.</p><p>An ingress rating of 8 — as is the case with the Z Flip 6 — basically denotes that the device is fully safeguarded against liquids, and when it comes to solids, the foldable is able to resist particles greater than 1mm in diameter. Having used Samsung&apos;s foldables extensively over the last four years, I can confirm that dust gets <em>everywhere</em>. All the small nooks and crannies around the hinge get filthy after a few months of use, but this shouldn&apos;t be as much of an issue on the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Most foldable manufacturers have a way of safeguarding the chassis so that errant dust particles don&apos;t make their way into the hinge mechanism itself — Samsung uses tiny bristles to ward away dust — and while it is effective, it isn&apos;t quite on the same level as the dust ingress that you get on regular phones. That said, any sort of protection in this area should make a considerable difference.</p>

<p>Samsung has unleashed its new foldables right next to its latest Galaxy Watch 7 series and also a bunch of other products. Like most of its products, these new devices are Galaxy AI-powered and additionally feature the goodness of Google&apos;s AI. The search giant also participated in the event to showcase Circle to Search&apos;s new capabilities debuting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>Google executives like Rick Osterloh and Jenny Blackburn took the stage to demonstrate what Gemini AI can do alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> feature on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a>.</p>

<p>Users can either say "Hey, Google" or swipe from the corner of the screen to trigger the Gemini AI. For instance, imagine watching some random video on YouTube; they can seek the new "Ask about this video" suggestion.</p><p>Since the Galaxy Z Fold 6 supports a split screen view, users can watch the video on one side of the foldable screen and check the Gemini suggestion on the other side. This new feature will be available for foldable screen users in the coming months.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Circle to Search made its way to most Android phones early this year. It included translation capabilities and homework help for students. To help them become independent problem solvers, Circle to Search will be adding more complex topics like symbolic math, which, when asked, will give step-by-step problem-solving techniques instead of just projecting the answer.</p><p>Along with the new feature, Circle to Search will soon add features like the ability to scan barcodes and QR codes on your screens.</p>

<p>The premium Galaxy Z Fold 6 will further support multi-viewing for YouTube TV subscribers. It will allow users to view four different streams at the same time, like on Google TV. Users "can choose from pre-selected combinations of football, news, weather, and simultaneous sporting events," the company notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-updates-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024/">announcement blog post</a>.</p><p>Samsung announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-launch">Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra</a> at the Unpacked event. They will be the first smartwatches to ship with Google&apos;s latest Wear OS 5 operating system. In May, the search giant shared the new OS&apos;s performance gains and battery life improvements at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2022-biggest-announcements-keynote">Google I/O</a>.</p>

This "background_mode" is stated to let users continue to leverage Gemini&apos;s Live chats "while using other apps" and when your device is locked. The feature suggests that Gemini is always active and listening to a user&apos;s questions.</p><p>As such, ending Gemini&apos;s "live chat" can be done by saying "Stop" aloud or by ending it manually via the notification banner.</p>

<p>During I/O 2024, Google detailed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=versions%20called%20%22Gems.%22-,Gemini%20Live,-%3A%20Coming%20to">Gemini spinoff</a> dubbed "Live," which is positioned to be a voice-first version of the AI model. With the model acting more like OpenAI&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">ChatGPT-4o</a>, users can serve up queries to the software and receive an appropriate answer in return. We learned that Google is preparing to debut the feature with 10 different voices and "interrupt mid-response with clarifying questions."</p><p>Users aren&apos;t expected to see the Gemini Live launch until later this year when it will land in the hands of Gemini Advanced.</p><p>While we wait, another feature involving Gemini was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-android-dual-instance-feature-discovered">earlier this month</a> and could have some interesting uses. Google is in development of a "drag and drop" feature for Gemini&apos;s pop-up window. Users can split the AI into two different instances for separate text conversations.</p><p>Luckily, it doesn&apos;t seem that Google plans to make this a Pixel exclusive as a piece of code referenced Samsung with the new feature.</p>
