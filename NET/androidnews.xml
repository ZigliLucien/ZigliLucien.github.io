<hr>
<p>There were rumors swirling around recently about Samsung dropping an update this month to fix the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>&apos;s camera glitches, but now it looks like that might not happen.</p><p>Reliable leaker Ice Universe says that a major camera update for the Galaxy S24 Ultra won&apos;t be coming until June (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/next-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-improvement-update-delayed/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">S24 Ultra's camera update has been delayed, at least until June.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1783107452961001543">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1776877562536546451" target="_blank">early April</a>, the same tipster claimed that a Galaxy S24 Ultra update was on its way, promising fixes for issues like wonky telephoto image quality, off-target white balance, and weird red hues. It now seems like that&apos;s the update that&apos;s been held up.</p><p>Even though the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with top-tier camera capabilities, its picture quality isn&apos;t hitting the mark. People on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S24/S24-Ultra-camera-issues-white-balance-off-and-over-exposed/td-p/2812057/page/4" target="_blank">forums</a> are venting their frustrations about camera problems they&apos;ve been facing since they got the phone. Things like the HDR feature not quite delivering and the telephoto cameras not living up to expectations are some of the major concerns.</p><p>Samsung did try to fix things up with an update at the end of March to boost the camera game on the Galaxy S24.</p><p>Usually, Samsung releases a major camera upgrade for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">top-notch Galaxy phones</a> around June each year. For example, last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-acknowledge-blurring-problem-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S23 got a sweet update in June 2023</a> that jazzed up the portrait modes with 2x zoom and smoothed out the HDR processing.</p><p>Samsung is pretty tied up right now, rolling out the One UI 6.1 update for its smartphones and sorting out a bunch of bugs that came along with it. So, it may make sense if the company is putting the brakes on those specific camera upgrades for the Galaxy S24 Ultra for now.</p><p>With a bit of luck, Samsung will take advantage of this delay to tackle the heap of problems that Galaxy S24 users are grappling with regarding its camera. Apart from the lackluster HDR performance, the phone is also having a tough time capturing moving subjects, such as kids and pets, according to various posts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ajmfi5/android_authority_moving_pets_and_people_are/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/mobile-apps-services/capturing-fast-moving-subjects-issue/td-p/9465802" target="_blank">Samsung Community pages</a>. This issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-galaxy-s23-ultra-finally-better-at-taking-photos-of-moving-objects">has been a recurring headache with Galaxy phones</a>, and it feels like Samsung hasn&apos;t done much to sort it out.</p>

<p>Moondrop also makes planar headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Venus</a>, but it has loftier ambitions for its next product, the MIAD01. Abbreviated for Mobile Internet Audio Device, MIAD01 is a phone that has a balanced 4.4mm connector alongside a single-ended 3.5mm jack, a flagship decoding chip, and independent audio circuitry that should mitigate any interference.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the phone hardware itself. The MIAD01 will have a 6.7-inch flexible OLED panel with 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh, and interestingly, 1920Hz DC dimming. In renders shared by the brand on X, the device looks like any other giant slab, with the ports located at the top.</p><p>As someone who tests enthusiast audio products along with a gazillion phones a year, it feels like the MIAD01 is tailored to my needs. Moondrop teased details of the MIAD01 at the start of the year, but I didn&apos;t take those seriously — audio brands tend to share grandiose plans all the time, but most of them don&apos;t come to fruition. In this instance, however, the brand has actually launched the phone, and it is available via audio retailer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/moondrop-miad01">HiFiGo for $399</a>. </p>

<p>Obviously, that invites a lot of questions. Why is Moondrop making a phone? Will it have the Play Store? How many updates will it get? What about after-sales service? Making a phone is significantly more challenging than audio products, and most brands instead choose to go with digital audio players. These players have a screen, decent hardware, dedicated audio circuitry, and usually run an AOSP build of Android. Think of these devices as phones without all the connectivity bits.</p><p>Fiio&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a> is a good example; it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 660, comes with ESS Sabre&apos;s high-end ES9038Q2M DACs, a 5-inch 720p screen, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 5300mAh battery. It runs Android 10, and will make the switch to Android 12 later in the year. While Android 10 is outdated, it is still usable in this setting, as all you&apos;re doing with the interface is playing your music streaming service of choice.</p><p>Designing a phone is much more complex; it needs cellular radios, and should be able to handle a variety of mundane tasks — send texts, make calls, browse the web, use social media, play games, and everything else you do with a phone — in addition to playing music. Moondrop just doesn&apos;t have the resources or the technical knowhow to make a phone, so the MIAD01 will be a rebranded version of an existing device.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Then we'll see MIAD01, ...4.4mm fully balanced +3.5mm SEFlagship decoding chipGold-sinking independent audio circuitIndependently LDO supplyEnjoy a pure quality.#moondrop #MIAD01 pic.twitter.com/UsigSqs0vI<a href="https://twitter.com/MoondropLab/status/1782696958831804893">April 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Considering the MIAD01 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, it limits the options to a Chinese entity. I don&apos;t see Xiaomi, Honor, or any of the BBK brands somehow turning into a white label manufacturer, so if I had to venture a guess, the MIAD01 is using an ODM that caters to smaller manufacturers, like Blu.</p><p>The blocky design of the MIAD01 is reminiscent of ZTE&apos;s Nubia Z60 Ultra, but the MIAD01 is a mid-ranger. The brand confirmed that it will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7050, which uses older Arm v8 cores, including two Cortex A78 and six A55 cores. It will have 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, 12GB of RAM, and a MicroSD slot that holds up to 2TB cards.</p>

<p>While it&apos;s interesting to speculate on the hardware, it&apos;s the software that is the biggest limiting factor for a new brand venturing into this segment. And unlike digital audio players, AOSP doesn&apos;t cut it on a phone, so the MIAD01 will need differentiated software. And somehow, I doubt Moondrop&apos;s ability to deliver on that front; the brand&apos;s Link app to connect to its earbuds is riddled with issues, and is often unusable.</p><p>It would be ideal to have a phone that also doubles as a music player, and LG did a great job catering to this niche. But that&apos;s in the past, and I don&apos;t quite see Moondrop rising to the challenge. The brand had its share of misses in recent years, and it may have taken on too much with the MIAD01. The device will need to deliver terrific audio, and simultaneously go up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phones</a>.</p><p>A more sensible option would have been to launch a digital audio player like Fiio, HiBy, Shanling, Sony, Astell & Kern, and other audio brands, but as we&apos;ve seen in the past, Moondrop doesn&apos;t like to play by conventional rules. That said, I am interested in taking a look at the MIAD01, and seeing how it holds up — both as a phone, and as a digital audio player. </p>

While the latest build is much more stable than earlier releases, it still isn&apos;t quite ready to be used on a daily driver just yet.</p><p>That will change with subsequent builds, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15 beta program</a> is limited to Pixels, third-party manufacturers should announce plans to offer the beta on their own devices by mid-May, which is when the beta will kick into high gear. If history is any indication, the stable build should be rolling out sometime in August.</p><p>Unlike the last two Android versions, Android 15 has plenty of interesting additions, including a notification cooldown mode, better optimization, ability to record parts of the screen, audio sharing over Bluetooth, and a slate of upgrades around foldables. So let&apos;s take a look at what phones will make the switch to Android 15, and when your device is likely to get the update.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google"><span>Google</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the Android 15 update will hit Pixels ahead of every other device. The beta program is limited to the Pixel series, and if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> or above, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a>. Obviously, Pixels will get the stable build on the day of release, and this gives Google&apos;s phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>That said, not all Pixels will upgrade to Android 15, with only the devices released in the last three years eligible to receive the build. Here&apos;s the list of Google devices that will get Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>While these devices can install the beta right now, I&apos;d advice against it; the build is usable, but it still has connectivity and camera bugs, and it isn&apos;t designed to be a daily driver. That may change with the second public beta, and I will update the post once that becomes available in the middle of May.</p>

<p>Samsung continues to be the largest phone manufacturer, and it releases more devices than any other phone brand. Samsung doesn&apos;t usually join the beta program at the same time as other manufacturers, instead opting to wait until it can roll out the next iteration of One UI. As the brand uses the stable Android 15 release as the base, that means you&apos;ll need to wait at least until August to get your hands on the next version of Android on your Galaxy phone.</p><p>Samsung does a great job rolling out the stable update to its flagships in a timely manner, but its mid-range and budget phones don&apos;t get the same level of attention, so if you have a Galaxy A device, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 (or even Q2) 2025 to make the switch to Android 15.</p><p>These are the Samsung phones that should get the Android 15-based One UI 7 update:</p>

<p>Samsung tends to prioritize its current devices over others, so it is likely that the beta update will be limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series when it goes live. Select Galaxy A devices also got beta builds last year, and we&apos;ll have to wait and see if the Galaxy A55 joins the list this time around.</p><p>As always, the list is a tentative guideline based on Samsung&apos;s update guarantee; while all the devices mentioned above should receive Android 15, there&apos;s no telling if that will be the case until Samsung confirms it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus"><span>OnePlus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K" name="oneplus-12-30.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island next to OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used to do a good job with updates, but it fumbled recent platform updates, leading to device-breaking bugs and lingering connectivity issues. And because the manufacturer uses ColorOS in all but name, it doesn&apos;t have much control over when it gets to roll out updates.</p><p>These OnePlus phones will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro</li><li>OnePlus 10T</li><li>OnePlus 10R/10R 150W</li><li>OnePlus 11</li><li>OnePlus 11R</li><li>OnePlus 12</li><li>OnePlus 12R</li><li>OnePlus Open</li><li>OnePlus Nord 3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus continues to just roll out a single update to its Nord N series of devices sold in North America, so even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> launched last year, it won&apos;t be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Considering how bad OnePlus was at delivering timely updates, I&apos;m not going to share any estimated timelines — this time, I&apos;ll wait until my devices get the stable Android 15 update before writing about it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-7-best-new-features-in-oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> is in a decent state now, but that wasn&apos;t the case during the beta — or even the initial stable builds. So if you have a OnePlus phone, I&apos;d suggest waiting and seeing if the stable update has any issues before installing it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo"><span>OPPO</span></h2>

<p>OPPO is doing a much better job with platform updates in general, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-flip-review">Find N2 Flip</a> picked up the stable Android 14 update before the end of 2023 — a sizeable achievement. With ColorOS 15 set to debut this year, it is likely we&apos;ll see a similar update cadence as last year.</p><p>OPPO guarantees four platform updates to its high-end phones, with its mid-range devices getting three updates. These are the OPPO phones that will get the Android 15-based ColorOS 15:</p>
<ul><li>OPPO Find X5</li><li>OPPO Find X5 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X6</li><li>OPPO Find X6 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X7</li><li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra</li><li>OPPO Find N2</li><li>OPPO Find N3</li><li>OPPO Find N2 Flip</li><li>OPPO Find N3 Flip</li><li>OPPO Reno 9</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro+</li><li>OPPO Reno 10</li><li>OPPO Reno 10 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11</li><li>OPPO Reno 11 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11F</li><li>OPPO F25 Pro</li></ul>

<p>Similar to OPPO, Vivo is delivering updates at a faster pace than previous years. And in Funtouch OS 14, the Chinese manufacturer has an interface that actually looks modern. Outside of that, Vivo continues to launch a lot of phones, with the V series getting a new model every six months.</p><p>As is the case with ColorOS, Vivo is unlikely to roll out an Android 15 build until Funtouch OS 15 is available. That said, these are the Vivo phones that will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Vivo X80</li><li>Vivo X80 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro+</li><li>Vivo X90s</li><li>Vivo X100</li><li>Vivo X100 Pro</li><li>Vivo X Fold</li><li>Vivo X Fold+</li><li>Vivo X Fold 2</li><li>Vivo X Flip</li><li>Vivo V27</li><li>Vivo V27 Pro</li><li>Vivo V27e</li><li>Vivo V29</li><li>Vivo V29 Pro</li><li>Vivo V29e</li><li>Vivo V30</li><li>Vivo V30 Pro</li></ul>
<p>As iQOO is basically a Vivo sub-brand, I&apos;m including its devices in the same list:</p>
<ul><li>iQOO 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10</li><li>iQOO 10 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10T</li><li>iQOO 11</li><li>iQOO 11 Pro</li><li>iQOO 12</li><li>iQOO Neo 7</li><li>iQOO Neo 7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 8</li><li>iQOO Neo 8 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 9</li><li>iQOO Neo 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7</li><li>iQOO Z7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7s</li><li>iQOO Z8x</li></ul>

<p>Honor is making a lot of progress in global markets, and the brand&apos;s ability to deliver standout devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> have allowed it to distinguish itself against its immediate rivals. While MagicOS 8.0 brings a lot of welcome additions, it still isn&apos;t quite as polished as other Chinese interfaces. Honor is instead leaning into AI, and it has a few unique features that are great to use.</p><p>Honor doesn&apos;t have a beta program as such, and the brand takes its time in rolling out stable updates to its devices. So if you have any of the phones listed below, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 2025 to get Android 15. With that out of the way, these are the Honor phones getting Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Honor Magic 5</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Lite</li><li>Honor Magic 6</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro RSR</li><li>Honor Magic Vs</li><li>Honor Magic V2</li><li>Honor Magic V2 RSR</li><li>Honor 90</li><li>Honor 90 Pro</li><li>Honor 90 Lite</li><li>Honor X50</li><li>Honor X50 Pro</li><li>Honor X50 GT</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus"><span>ASUS</span></h2>
<p>ASUS continues to be obstinate when it comes to platform updates, and the brand only guarantees two Android OS updates even though its devices have powerful hardware. This is the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, an otherwise great device that is hobbled by a shortsighted update policy.</p><p>Therefore, there are only six ASUS devices that will make the switch to Android 15, and three of those phones launched in 2024: </p>
<ul><li>ROG Phone 8</li><li>ROG Phone 8 Pro</li><li>ROG Phone 7</li><li>ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</li><li>Zenfone 10</li><li>Zenfone 11 Ultra</li></ul>

<p>Nothing is a relatively small brand, but it is doing the right things when it comes to software updates. All of the three devices in its portfolio — including the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> — will get three platform updates, and while it isn&apos;t quick to roll out updates, the fact that it is delivering the same update guarantee to its budget phone is a big deal.</p>
<ul><li>Nothing Phone 1</li><li>Nothing Phone 2</li><li>Nothing Phone 2a</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi"><span>Xiaomi</span></h2>

<p>Most major phone manufacturers do a great job rolling out timely updates, but that still isn&apos;t the case with Xiaomi. In the last three years, Xiaomi phones were the last to receive platform updates, and I don&apos;t see that changing in 2024. Like its Chinese rivals, Xiaomi now guarantees four platform updates to its high-end and select mid-range phones, but it doesn&apos;t make any promises as to <em>when</em> it will roll out those updates.</p><p>This is frustrating if you&apos;re using a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>; the device has the best camera package available today, and while the software is fluid and has good customizability, I&apos;m unwilling to bet on the phone picking up Android 15 before the end of the year. As for the update itself, the Xiaomi 12 series and above will switch to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Xiaomi 12</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Lite</li><li>Xiaomi 12S Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 13</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 14</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 2</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 3</li><li>Xiaomi 12T</li><li>Xiaomi 12T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13T</li><li>Xiaomi 13T Pro</li></ul>
<p>Redmi devices make up an overwhelming majority of Xiaomi&apos;s sales, but the brand uses an underhanded tactic where it doesn&apos;t launch these devices with the current version of Android. It&apos;s this strategy that makes it so hard to recommend a recent Redmi device; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12</a> series launched in Q1 2023 with Android 12 out of the box, six months after Android 13 became available. As such, these devices will not be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 series</a> debuted with Android 13 in February 2024, and this measure is to ensure that the devices don&apos;t get updated beyond Android 15. Therefore, the actual list of Redmi devices getting to Android 15 is a tiny minority:</p>
<ul><li>Redmi 12</li><li>Redmi Note 12 4G</li><li>Redmi Note 12R</li><li>Redmi Note 12T Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro+</li><li>Redmi K70</li><li>Redmi K70 Pro</li><li>Redmi K70E</li></ul>
<p>POCO is in a similar situation, and last year&apos;s X5 and X5 Pro won&apos;t get Android 15. These are the POCO devices that will get MIUI 15 based on Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>POCO F5</li><li>POCO F5 Pro</li><li>POCO X6</li><li>POCO X6 Pro</li><li>POCO X6 Neo</li><li>POCO M6</li><li>POCO M6 Pro</li><li>POCO C65</li></ul>

<p>Motorola changed its update policy, and the brand now rolls out three platform updates to most of its phones. Of course, that&apos;s limited to select mid-range and flagship devices, with its entry-level phones only getting one update.

<p>As always, I&apos;m closely monitoring the progress of Android 15, and will share any details as and when brands officially announce them. Based on previous years, Samsung is likely to kickstart its beta program a few weeks after Google rolls out the stable release, and other brands will follow suit. </p><p>Before that though, most major Android vendors will offer a vanilla Android 15 beta build that serves as a good baseline to see all the changes Google has introduced this year. That build should go live around the end of May, when public beta 2 rolls out. </p><p>And as for the stable builds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phoneshttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> should switch over to Android 15 before the end of the year, but that&apos;s contingent on the latter betas being devoid of bugs. </p>

<ul><li>Ahead of Google I/O next month, Google revealed a preliminary schedule for developer sessions.</li><li>One of those sessions is a preview for Wear OS 5, and it serves as the first official confirmation from Google that a Wear OS upgrade is coming this year.</li><li>The description for the "Building for the future of Wear OS" session includes a few early details about what the upgrade will bring. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google I/O 2024 is quickly coming to the forefront, as the event will start in a few weeks and may bring new hardware and software announcements from Google. The company gave us our first real idea of what to expect when it released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/" target="_blank">preliminary I/O 2024 schedule</a> on Thursday, April 25. That schedule includes an early confirmation that a Wear OS upgrade is coming soon.</p><p>There are four main categories for events at Google I/O this year: mobile, web, ML/AI, and cloud. One of the mobile sessions is titled "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/19faa1a5-5b4f-4e7a-ac06-8564a5a324af/" target="_blank">Building for the future of Wear OS</a>," and it explicitly lists Wear OS 5 — the unreleased version of Wear OS previously expected to come this year — as its focus. Back in January, references to Wear OS 5 were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">spotted in an Android 14 build</a>, hinting that an upgrade was on the horizon. </p><p>Still, there was no official confirmation from Google that Wear OS 5 would be released in the near future. While we expect to hear about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">upcoming Android updates</a> at Google I/O, Wear OS upgrades are typically released on a staggered and inconsistent schedule. That&apos;s why Google&apos;s announcement has more significance than a typical Google I/O software announcement and bodes well for the future of Google&apos;s wearable ecosystem. </p>
<h2 id="what-we-know-about-wear-os-5-so-far-2">What we know about Wear OS 5 so far</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9Sw4Jg6698WXgSrkTGaJq4" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-bay-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Sw4Jg6698WXgSrkTGaJq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly, Google gave a little bit away about Wear OS 5 in the description for its preview session. "In this talk, we&apos;ll discover the new features of Wear OS 5," Google says. "This includes advances in the Watch Face Format, and how to design and build for the increasing range of device sizes."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/05/introducing-watch-face-format-for-wear-os.html" target="_blank">Watch Face Format</a> was introduced about a year ago alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, and Google explains that it "can be used to build watch faces directly, or it can be integrated into creation tools, allowing designers to create watch faces without having to write any executable code." It shifted much of the burden of creating a custom watch face — such as optimization, updates, and bug fixes — off of individual developers and onto the Wear OS platform. Additionally, it added a consistent UI for editing watch faces across first and third-party options. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.64%;"><img id="ecxNApgkzHtcffC7HvLRMK" name="Wear-OS-4-watch-faces.jpg" alt="Wear OS features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ecxNApgkzHtcffC7HvLRMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="856" height="288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This gives watch face designers a lot of ways to customize their offerings, and pairs nicely with the Watch Face Studio from Samsung, which can be used to create XML-formatted watch faces in the Watch Face Format.</p><p>So, Google&apos;s talk about updating the Watch Face Format in Wear OS 5 could bring new features and options to your favorite watch faces. There might be new ways to show complications, adapt a watch face&apos;s appearance situationally, or add new design tools. This is all just speculation, but Google clearly has new tricks available in the updated Watch Face Format that will be showcased at I/O 2024. </p><p>The one thing we do know for sure is that the Watch Face Format, or watch face design software, will be updated to help developers build for different smartwatch sizes. Google says as much in the description for the Wear OS 5 showcase, and it isn&apos;t exactly surprising. Rumors are swirling that Google will finally add a new, larger Pixel Watch size later this year in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> series. It only makes sense that it wants to make sure Wear OS watch faces will look great on all Pixel Watch models.</p>
<h2 id="we-apos-ve-come-a-long-way-since-google-apos-s-neglect-of-wear-os-2">We&apos;ve come a long way since Google&apos;s neglect of Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edKfA2vywic6DuWe33ErJo" name="wear-os-logo-fossil-gen-6-wide.jpg" alt="Wear OS logo on a Fossil Gen 6 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edKfA2vywic6DuWe33ErJo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Forget specific features — it&apos;s a massive achievement that we&apos;re getting a Wear OS 5 upgrade this year at all. Wear OS devices are firmly hitting their stride, with Samsung releasing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">excellent Galaxy Watch models</a> and Google joining in with the Pixel Watch over a year ago. In that context, it&apos;s easy to forget how feeble the entire Wear OS platform was just a few years ago. </p><p>Looking back at Google&apos;s Wear OS forums, you can find countless examples of early Wear OS users describing the uncertain future of the platform and issues that had gone unresolved for months or years. One post from 2020 asked, "Is Google abandoning Wear OS?" and received support from other Wear OS users before it was locked and replies were disabled. The issue cited in the post? Google had developed a YouTube Music app for watchOS, but not Wear OS. It&apos;s a perfect microcosm of the problems that plagued the dark days of Wear OS. </p><p>Now, it&apos;s rebounding, and Wear OS 5&apos;s release this year may be the start of a consistent annual release schedule for Google for major version updates. That would put it on par with Apple&apos;s watchOS release schedule and would be great news for Wear OS users. The hardware available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> is quite good in 2024, thanks to chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a>, but the software still lags behind Apple Watch models in many ways. Now, with Google seemingly going all-in on Wear OS with its partner Samsung, that may be changing for good. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is working on a new in-app dialer in the latest beta version.</li><li>The messaging platform will likely add this convenience to help users call users whose numbers have not been saved.</li><li>The app also brings a new setting in Communities that allows users to join groups only on an invite basis.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp&apos;s latest beta version for Android has revealed some interesting new features that will likely be convenient add-ons for contacting other users.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-9-28-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-in-app-dialler-hidden-group-3436770/">Android Authority</a>), the Meta-owned messaging platform is testing a new in-app dialer that lets users quickly add or even just dial phone numbers that aren&apos;t in their contacts list. The feature is being tested in WhatsApp beta for the Android <strong>2.23.15.11</strong> version.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="hAA9zRfzSfJFVYauKspXo8" name="whatsapp-in-app-dialer.jpg" alt="WhatsApp in-app dialer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAA9zRfzSfJFVYauKspXo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The WABetaInfo has also shared the new screenshot of the new in-app dialer, which may be seen in future updates on the messaging platform. It can be a convenient addition for users who don&apos;t want to store certain numbers in their address book, especially with businesses or one-time interactions. It should also make it generally more convenient to call directly from the app, as it avoids switching between the Phone app and WhatsApp on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>additionally, Android tipster Assemble Debug has revealed a new Hidden Group setting for Communities on WhatsApp. The new feature was seen on some WhatsApp beta version <strong>2.24.9.27</strong> users. The tipster enabled it by tweaking some flags in the Group permissions section on the messaging platform. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="T2RerR2vSJLcMYErJCk4v8" name="whatsapp-hidden-group-community.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Hidden group setting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2RerR2vSJLcMYErJCk4v8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Assemble Debug/ via Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes under the Group visibility parameter, and enabling it only allows invited members to find and join the respective group. Likewise, the same group admins can "only find and remove" the specific group per their requirement. </p><p>WhatsApp is seen constantly working on rolling and testing out new updates to the messaging platform to catch up and stay on top of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">rival messaging apps</a>. The app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-is-apparently-making-it-easier-to-handle-your-top-contacts">recently tested</a> a new "Favorite" contacts feature that lets users feature their top contacts. WhatsApp has also been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-to-add-one-minute-video-status-updates">testing</a> a longer Instagram-like Stories feature.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new Android 15 Beta 1.2 update for beta testers just days after it released Beta 1.1.</li><li>The new update includes fixes for app freezes, phantom battery drain, crashes, and more.</li><li>All devices that are enrolled in the Android Beta for Pixel program will get Android 15 Beta 1.2 as an OTA software update. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is still months away from platform stability, but Google has quickly released a few updates for Android 15 Beta 1 that hope to fix a few annoying issues.</p><p>Earlier this week, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-1-1">Android 15 Beta 1.1 update addressed a major problem</a> that broke NFC on Pixel phones running the first beta. Now, Google is following up on those improvements with the Android 15 Beta 1.2 patch, which started rolling out to beta testers on Thursday, April 25.</p><p>Google announced the release of the patch in a Reddit post and updated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes#beta-1.2" target="_blank">Android 15 release notes</a> accordingly. The company calls it a "minor update," but Android 15 Beta 1.2 includes a few considerable bug fixes. Among other changes, Beta 1.2 comes with performance improvements that should address the excessive battery drain Pixel users experienced while running earlier versions of Beta 1. The improvements hint that Android 15 Beta 1.2 is much more stable, but Google reminds testers that some reported issues in Beta 1 and Beta 1.1 are yet to be addressed. </p><p>Some people running the Android 15 Beta 1 or 1.1 software ran into an "Application Not Responding" error that caused apps to freeze, and that has been resolved. Additionally, a problem resulting in a flickering display was fixed in Android 15 Beta 1.2. Google also fixed a few system issues in Beta 1.2, like the back gesture not working and the settings app crashing when trying to add a fingerprint. </p><p>Those are all the bug fixes that Google shared in the Android 15 Beta 1.2 release notes, though there may be more. Either way, the pace at which Google is shipping Android 15 Beta patches is a good sign of what&apos;s to come for early-access testers.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">enrolled in the Android Beta</a> for Pixel program, you should receive Android 15 Beta 1.2 through an OTA update automatically. The update is available for Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7, Pixel 6a, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. In other words, every device eligible for Android 15 Betas can also install this patch.</p><p>Google says that it may take up to 24 hours for your device to see the update, and you can check for updates by navigating to <strong>Settings > System > System updates</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the past 10-15 years, we&apos;ve been seeing the slow decline of smaller devices in favor of ones with larger screens. "Bigger is better" is the motto that many companies now live by, and the same sentiment rings true with tablets. There are a few exceptions, such as Apple&apos;s iPad Mini, but in most cases, if you want the best tablet experience, especially on Android, it&apos;s big screen or bust.</p><p>One could surmise that the desire to use tablets as laptop replacements has led to larger and more obnoxious screen sizes. Unfortunately, there are still compromises to be found even with the best tablets. I mean, it&apos;s absurd to me that Samsung doesn&apos;t offer the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra with cellular connectivity. That&apos;s reserved for the Tab S9 Plus, which is fine, but the Ultra is easily more of a laptop replacement than the Plus. </p><p>For the most part, if a tablet is released and is smaller than ten inches, it probably features middling or laughable specs. This wasn&apos;t always the case, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nexus-7-2013-review">Nexus 7</a> from 2013 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-tab-s3-suitable-replacement-aging-pixel-c">Galaxy Tab S3</a> from 2017 were both flagship tablets with sub-10-inch screens. </p>

<p>Nowadays, a tablet larger than 10 inches usually means that it&apos;s a flagship tablet with more power and better screens. There are obvious exceptions to this rule, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> and FE Plus, which are both above my made-up size threshold while using Exynos chips.</p><p>I&apos;ve often wondered why this is the case, especially as flagship processors continue to get more efficient while still providing plenty of power. Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1031651.html">Lenovo Y700</a>, for example. It was released in China last year and offers an 8.8-inch display and a 2560 x 1600 resolution. Powering the Y700 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a>, paired with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj" name="lenovo-legion-tab-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab (2024) lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lenovo recently announced a refreshed model (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/legion-tab-android-gaming-tablet-is-coming-to-emea-and-asia/">Legion Tab</a>) that keeps the same internals but swaps out the glossy display for a "micro-nano etched" glass. From everything that I&apos;ve seen, it seems pretty similar to the etched glass found on the higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-vs-steam-deck-lcd-what-are-the-differences">Steam Deck</a> configurations. For what it&apos;s worth, this aims to minimize the glare without compromising the quality of the display.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m also aware that the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 is an outdated chip, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> now powers many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. But, I would argue that there&apos;s still space in the market for tablets that bridge the gap between budget and flagship.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hmF6szv97ttQth68JyrayB" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-with-galaxy-z-fold-5.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE next to Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmF6szv97ttQth68JyrayB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For reference, the Legion Tab is priced at €599, which translates to almost $640. Without accounting for any deals or trade-in promotions, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Tab S9 FE Plus</a> retails for $600 but isn&apos;t exactly the ideal couch-surfing tablet. For an extra $40, I&apos;d rather go with the Legion Tab, even if it lacks the extra software polish and features found in One UI.</p><p>You might be wondering why I&apos;m complaining about this as a faithful believer in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. But, the recent launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/razer-kishi-ultra-launch">Razer Kishi Ultra</a> and its marketed compatibility with the 8.3-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-ipad-mini-seems-great-even-if-you-love-android">iPad Mini</a> made me realize that there isn&apos;t really an equivalent on the Android side.</p><p>I also understand that the iPad Mini isn&apos;t technically a flagship tablet and hasn&apos;t been updated in more than two years. However, it still sets the bar for tablets in this form factor, even offering 5G connectivity to complement the reliability of iPadOS, and I think we need a similar device in the Android space.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don't understand why Samsung keeps releasing the Tab S6 Lite with minor spec bumps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One thing that I am surprised about is that Samsung hasn&apos;t tried to do this. The company seems content with refreshing its flagship lineup every year or two, then sprinkling in a few random mid-range and budget devices in between. And for whatever reason, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</a> keeps getting a spec bump every couple of years.</p><p>I&apos;ve come to realize that while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are incredible, there are situations where a dedicated device just works better. This is partially why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> hasn&apos;t replaced all of my computing needs, despite being quite convenient when the situation arises. Another example is when I reach for a dedicated gaming handheld as opposed to just firing up Steam Link or Moonlight on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and streaming games from my PC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="55c3V8VaEwTWKRL5FasQBk" name="pizza-boy-a-basic-oneplus-open.jpg" alt="Pizza Boy A Basic on OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55c3V8VaEwTWKRL5FasQBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A small-ish tablet that can get close to, if not match, the performance of my phone is something that I hope more companies explore. I mean, let&apos;s be honest here. The tablet market is already fragmented like crazy, so what&apos;s wrong with throwing in another wrench?</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think Samsung or any other company will actually end up venturing down this path. Lenovo&apos;s Y700 was only available in China, and the Legion Tab is expected to launch only in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. We haven&apos;t heard anything about a potential release in North America, but I&apos;ll be keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Baseus is turning into one of the best accessory manufacturers, and while it is primarily known for its charging accessories — power banks, chargers, and cables — the brand is venturing into new areas. Audio is a big push for the Chinese brand, and its latest product has plenty to offer. </p><p>While there&apos;s no shortage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, most designs available today have an in-ear design that sees the sound nozzle nuzzling into your ear canal. Audio brands do a good job creating universal designs that fit most ear profiles, but if you have issues with sizing or want earbuds that don&apos;t isolate noise, there&apos;s an alternative: open-ear earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="T4QbZWnWJwEMfrtwikVk99" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-2.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4QbZWnWJwEMfrtwikVk99.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea with open-ear earbuds is that they sit outside your ear canal, using directional acoustics to transmit sound; this way, you can still enjoy music without worrying about any sound leakage. And as these earbuds don&apos;t cover your ear canal, you can hear external sounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pM4Nf5t242qEXYTj97Amm9" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-3.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pM4Nf5t242qEXYTj97Amm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the Eli Sport 1, Baseus did a great job nailing the basics. The earbuds retail for $69, but they&apos;re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Headphones-Directional-Ultra-Light-Waterproof/dp/B0CT2DXS51">available for just $49 on Amazon</a> as of writing, and that makes them a phenomenal value. The earbuds are available in white, black, and green variants, and the green model looks good; the green accents offer a good contrast to the white shells.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oPbcRafiBdX2RhrxNCDFT9" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-4.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPbcRafiBdX2RhrxNCDFT9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who uses a lot of IEMs that are designed to get a tight seal, it&apos;s a bit disorienting to wear the Eli Sport 1; I kept constantly thinking that the earbuds would fall out at any moment. They didn&apos;t, and after a few days, I got used to the design. There are ear hooks that goes around the back of your ear, serving as the counterweight to the buds. While I don&apos;t prefer using buds with ear hooks, they didn&apos;t exert any noticeable pressure on the outside of the ear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7kV2NeXgP5cXqjpJP6ELgA" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-7.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7kV2NeXgP5cXqjpJP6ELgA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another trait that&apos;s markedly different is that they don&apos;t isolate any ambient noise, so that takes some getting used to; I wear earbuds while mashing away on my mechanical keyboard, and I don&apos;t hear the sounds of the keyboard at all. But in this case, I was able to hear the keyboard sounds in their entirety while using the earbuds, and any other external sounds that filtered in. Of course, this is by design, and if you want noise isolation, open-ear earbuds aren&apos;t for you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RjHFsEpeeXvDFAi26wqrAC" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-12.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RjHFsEpeeXvDFAi26wqrAC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design itself looks good, and the detachable neckband that makes them a good option for workouts. The IPX4 ingress protection also makes a difference, but it&apos;s the fit that makes the Eli Sport 1 stand out; as the earbuds sit outside the ear, they&apos;re inherently comfortable to wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="drvzD6qEJpRAtkBAy8pbvC" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-15.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drvzD6qEJpRAtkBAy8pbvC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue I have with the design is the charging case; it is significantly larger than what you get with most earbuds, and it is barely pocketable. Another quibble is with gesture controls; the outer surface acts as a gesture zone, but it doesn&apos;t trigger playback controls consistently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ntf5xLKQvzLfQarRNcCR5A" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-5.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntf5xLKQvzLfQarRNcCR5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound tube of the Eli Sport 1 is angled by 20 degrees, and Baseus says this minimizes sound leakage. That is indeed the case, and the Eli Sport 1 does a great job delivering detailed sound without any external leakage. On that note, I used the buds alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a>, and while they don&apos;t have the same nuanced sound, they&apos;re surprisingly good — I didn&apos;t think the sound quality would be anywhere as good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="moemtgUtXitQsr9f8EzgsA" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-8.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/moemtgUtXitQsr9f8EzgsA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Baseus went with 16.2mm drivers in the Eli Sport 1, and the large drivers are terrific; you get a vibrant bass with a lot of energy, detailed mids, and a good treble extension that doesn&apos;t have any sibilance. Bass frequencies are exaggerated, but they don&apos;t take over the rest of the mix, and it makes using the Eli Sport 1 that much more engaging.</p>
<p>Considering the open-ear nature of the earbuds, I thought sound quality would be a distinct afterthought, but that isn&apos;t the case. Yes, it doesn&apos;t sound as good as the OnePlus Buds 3, but the Eli Sport 1 easily holds its own against budget wireless earbuds, and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P7ZgZhgeNuLjpFeN2MgsQC" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-13.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7ZgZhgeNuLjpFeN2MgsQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to like on the battery side of things as well, with the Eli Sport 1 managing to last seven hours between charges. There&apos;s fast charging that delivers 90 minutes of usage with a 10-minute charge, and battery life is among the best in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FQFD6ikJ4Scm847G9B8FmC" name="baseus-eli-sport-1-earbuds-14.jpg" alt="Baseus Eli Sport 1 earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQFD6ikJ4Scm847G9B8FmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wasn&apos;t sure what the Eli Sport 1 would be like when I got started with the earbuds, but it has been a revelation. The open-ear design is comfortable like no other earbuds I&apos;ve used up to this point, but it&apos;s the sound quality that&apos;s the real star of the show. You miss out on noise isolation, but other than that, there isn&apos;t anything inherently wrong with these earbuds, and at $49, they are an outstanding value.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has announced its Q1 2024 financial earnings.</li><li>The company reported $80.5 billion in revenue, highlighting strong performance across its services.</li><li>Alphabet recently announced a major restructuring to better accelerate efforts to bring AI into its products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Alphabet announced its Q1 2024 earnings on Wednesday (April 25), reporting more than $80 billion in revenue, 15% up from the same quarter last year.</p><p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlights the company&apos;s strong focus on AI and the performance of other products. "Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud," Pichai says in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/91/b3/3f9213d14ce3ae27e1038e01a0e0/2024q1-alphabet-earnings-release-pdf.pdf">statement</a>.</p><p>"We are well under way with our Gemini era and there&apos;s great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation."</p><p>AI has been a big focus for Google, which has focused on injecting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model across its services, including Search and Workspace. Google has rolled out its Gemini AI on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and across other devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series, and soon, it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/googles-best-ai-models-are-coming-to-oppo-and-oneplus-phones">on OnePlus and OPPO phones</a>, helping to power various generative AI features.</p><p>Search is also up, with Alphabet reporting more than $46 billion in revenue. While Google has been testing generative AI in Search, the company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">named Liz Reid as the new head of Search</a>. The move signals a stronger focus on AI features in Search, as Pichai points out improvements in user response.</p><p>"Most notably based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results," he said during the earnings call.</p><p>When asked about how on-device Gemini AI on phones affects potential monetization, Pichai seemed confident that it shouldn&apos;t, noting that there are still plenty of use cases for accessing the cloud.</p><p>"... in terms of on-device versus cloud...there will be needs which can be done on-device, and we should definitely privacy standpoint, but there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don&apos;t see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus soft-cloud in any way."</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube and Cloud also saw increased revenue during the quarter, but just like with Search, AI underscored everything that Google has been doing as it injects Gemini into various aspects of the business. It&apos;s no surprise, however, as other companies such as Meta continue to do the same.</p><p>Meta, which recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">reported its Q1 2024 earnings</a>, announced its latest AI model that&apos;s now found across its apps, as well as new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">multimodal search capabilities</a> for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</p><p>However, to combat the growing competition, Google is partnering with companies like Meta, bringing its search results to Meta AI for real-time results within the apps. Google also recently announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">massive internal reorganization</a>, combining its hardware and software teams to better accelerate momentum with new products and services, particularly with AI features.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) settled a vote today (April 25) to restore net neutrality in the country.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402082A1.pdf">the FCC</a>, the restoration places the internet back under the agency&apos;s "Title II telecommunications service" classification. The FCC states this will allow it to "protect consumers, defend national security, and advance public safety." </p><p>The current FCC Chairwoman, Jessica Rosenworcel, provided a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/net-neutrality-fcc-broadband-regulation-cc8421bc4f11a3e0f6ffc22c358fbfd0">AP News</a>, saying that "in our post-pandemic world, we know that broadband is a necessity, not a luxury." The measure had reportedly passed with a 3-2 split by party lines.</p><p>With net neutrality back on the table, there are a few factors that consumers should be aware of regarding their internet access and broadband networks.</p><p>The FCC states the vote&apos;s choice to restore neutrality "prohibits" internet providers from "blocking and throttling" a user&apos;s speeds and activities. Additionally, services can no longer pay to prioritize lawful content over others.</p><p>Regarding service outages, the FCC adds it can now play an active role in figuring out how to restore the internet for affected users.</p><p>The other side of things involves the FCC&apos;s ability to oversee national security. The press release states the government body has regained the ability to "revoke the authorizations of foreign-owned entities who pose a threat to national security to operate broadband networks in the U.S."</p><p>Lastly, the FCC&apos;s successful vote states it can now create a "national standard" where the internet is treated as an "essential service.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we voted to restore Net Neutrality. This reestablishes a national open internet standard to protect consumers, defend national security, and advance public safety. https://t.co/moRpznTDEd<a href="https://twitter.com/FCC/status/1783546289071800507">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/net-neutrality-fcc-joe-biden">been a long road</a>, as the FCC&apos;s rules were previously put in place in 2015 courtesy of then-Chairman Tom Wheeler. However, two years later, in 2017, the FCC voted to remove all such rules, taking us back to a time when ISPs could dictate certain aspects of our internet service. The only requirement was that internet services had to state publicly that they were going to block or throttle service.</p><p>After the Trump administration stripped away net neutrality rules, talks to bring them back reignited in 2021 after the Biden Administration produced a wide-ranged executive order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">calling the FCC to reinstate its rules</a>. For context, net neutrality ensures that all users have the same level of access and browsing speeds when surfing the web. As we&apos;ve seen following today&apos;s vote, ISPs can no longer throttle or block anything a user chooses to engage with.</p>
