<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Certain smart TVs, including the Chromecast with Google TV and TVs running Android 14 or higher, will soon function as Google Home hubs.</li><li>Google is launching new Home APIs, allowing apps and services to integrate with your smart home more seamlessly.</li><li>The APIs will connect with over 600 million devices, including any that are Matter-compliant or compatible with Works with Google Home.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At Google I/O 2024, the search giant announced major updates for smart home and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> users, including turning select smart TVs into Google Home hubs.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/home-apis-enabling-all-developers-to-build-for-the-home/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google revealed plans to allow devices like Google TV devices and some LG TVs to act as smart home hubs for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> later this year. This will include devices like the Chromecast with Google TV and certain TVs running Android 14 or higher.</p>

<p>Thanks to the new Home APIs Google is rolling out, apps and various services can now interact with your smart home. This means any app, whether it&apos;s specifically designed for smart homes or not, can tap into Google Home’s automation capabilities.</p><p>These APIs offer access to the 600 million devices supported by the platform, including any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> device or <em>Works with Google Home</em> device. Developers can also integrate Google Home devices and automations into their apps on both iOS and Android to create custom experiences.</p><p>Google has disclosed that initial adopters of its Home APIs include companies like ADT and Eve. ADT is rolling out a <em>Trusted Neighbor</em> feature that uses Google smart home products to give neighbors, friends, or helpers secure, temporary access to homes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Eve is tapping into the Home APIs to launch its app on Android, enabling automations such as lowering blinds automatically when it cools down at night. Furthermore, Google Pixel devices are using these APIs to blend digital and physical experiences, so activating bedtime mode can dim your phone&apos;s screen along with dimming your bedroom lights, lowering the shades, and locking the front door.</p><p>The goal is to help developers craft smooth interactions between their apps and users&apos; smart home setups. The cool part is that this isn&apos;t just for smart home app developers. Google mentioned that the Home APIs could link <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> with apps related to fitness or delivery, too.</p><p>While you can already set up these kinds of automations in the Google Home app, extending them to other apps could significantly expand the accessibility of smart home features.</p>

To gain the larger savings, you&apos;ll simply need to let Best Buy help you connect the phone to your carrier.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus features a vibrant, 6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED display, and it gets its powerful performance partially from boasting 12GB or more of RAM, along with the capable Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor.</p>

<p>Right now, Best Buy is offering $150 to $250 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, a capable, good-looking phone.</p>
<p>If you were already thinking about getting the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, this deal is a good opportunity to do so. And even if you weren't specifically looking for that model, this is still a good way to get one of Samsung's premium phones at a few hundred bucks cheaper than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S24-Plus-Cell-Phone-256GB-AI-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-50MP-Camera-Fastest-Processor-Long-Battery-Life-US-Version-2024-Onyx-Black/5262667714">Walmart - $849.99</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDR2X3M">Amazon - $849.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-cobalt-violet/6570290.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c9cce031-68fc-4418-bb16-0a870f32bba3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>phones with a long-term update guarantee are preferable to you; you&apos;ve enjoyed past Galaxy devices you&apos;ve owned; you want a phone that has some of Samsung&apos;s latest AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a phone with industry-leading charging speeds; you&apos;re looking for a more affordable Galaxy phone model.</p><p>While the S24 Plus isn&apos;t listed on our index of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phones</a>, both of its siblings are, and this phone really isn&apos;t all that far off from either of those Galaxy phones. In any case, the S24 Plus offers a great upgrade-level phone experience, even for high-level performance needs like gaming. The basic S24 Plus already includes 12GB of RAM, as upgraded from the phone&apos;s last generation, as well as a super efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. It also comes with a long battery life, a great suite of cameras, and IP68 dust and water resistance, among other features.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the S24 Plus leaves a little something to be desired when it comes to charging speeds, though it generally charges fast enough for the average user. Additionally, If a low price is more of a priority for you, you might want to consider Samsung&apos;s entry-level Galaxy A series—though this is a great price for this premium-level phone.</p>

<p>It probably got lost in the wave of AI announcements during Google I/O, but a report also came out regarding the next OnePlus Open. Unfortunately, those who were hoping for OnePlus to release a Galaxy Z Fold 6 competitor this year may be disappointed. But I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing, so let&apos;s talk about why.</p><p>Before getting in the weeds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-might-not-see-a-successor-this-year">reason</a> for the lack of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> in 2024 is simple — OPPO reportedly isn&apos;t going to release a Find N5 this year. On X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/That_Kartikey/status/1788815412882272698" target="_blank">@That_Kartikey</a> stated, "Oppo will not release the Oppo Find N5 Series this year thus no OnePlus Open 2 as well!" In a reply, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1789148176378974628" target="_blank">@chunvn8888</a> followed up, stating that it&apos;s "scheduled for next year instead, uses 8 Gen 4."</p>

<p>Nothing is confirmed, as neither company has revealed its next foldable plans, so for now, we should take this with a grain of salt. However, as someone who has a deep affinity for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>, I have to admit that I was bummed to see this. I was hopeful that a OnePlus Open 2 would be released this year, which would implement proper stylus support, along with updated cameras. But here&apos;s the thing — there&apos;s not really anything that warrants an upgraded model right now.</p><p>My only <em>real</em> complaint about the OnePlus Open is the hoops I had to jump through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/using-oppo-pen-with-oneplus-open">just to get a stylus</a>. Since then, it&apos;s been pretty smooth sailing. OnePlus even partnered with Google so you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-brings-android-15-beta-1-to-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-open-users">Android 15 Beta on the Open</a>, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>The Open isn&apos;t perfect; no smartphone is. But for foldable phones, it&apos;s about as close as it gets. This idea of switching to a two-year release cycle is something that would be beneficial for the market, as there&apos;s definitely a bit of fatigue in the space. It&apos;s even the case with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, considering that Samsung has been content with re-packaging the Galaxy Z Fold 2 design for the past few years. Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is rumored to buck that trend, but I won&apos;t hold my breath.</p>

<p>Instead, moving to a bi-yearly release allows OPPO and other OEMs to put more thought into the product. This also goes for things like software and other features to help phones to stand out from the pack, instead of just recycling the same ideas and slapping on a different name.</p><p>Back in early 2023, I wrote that "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-should-not-release-pixel-8">Google shouldn&apos;t release the Pixel 8</a>." This was early in the year, just a few months after the Pixel 7 launched. The premise of that article was the same as why I think the OnePlus Open 2 being delayed to 2025 isn&apos;t a bad thing. It was also coming at a point when the global smartphone market saw a decline of 17% in Q4 2022 and a decline of 11% in "full-year" shipments.</p><p>As of April 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52032524">a report by the IDC</a> shows that there&apos;s a bit of a rebound taking effect, as "global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% year over year" in Q1 2024. While that might seem great on paper, the report goes on to share that Samsung, Apple, and OPPO all saw a decline in shipments YoY.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The smartphone market is rebounding, but not for Samsung, Apple, or Oppo.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I could dive into some of the nitty-gritty about performance, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 to the Gen 3</a>. There&apos;s definitely a significant jump between generations, but let&apos;s be honest—are you <em>really</em> going to notice?</p><p>Maybe if you&apos;re heavy into emulation, but that&apos;s a niche within a niche anyway. It&apos;s not like OnePlus offers a desktop solution when you plug the Open into a monitor like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>. So, in reality, outside of some potential camera upgrades and having a newer battery, an updated OnePlus Open doesn&apos;t really scratch any itch.</p><p>Wait a year, see what Google does with the rest of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and implement any necessary changes. Be one of the first to hit the ground running when the final version is ready, and then smooth out any kinks until the Open 2 is ready. By then, maybe Google will have progressed enough with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-15-desktop-mode-revamp-spotted">native Desktop Mode</a> that it can be another selling point. Or, take what Google is already doing and turn it into a true DeX competitor.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We don't need a OnePlus Open 2 in 2024 if it's just going to be iterative.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That&apos;s what I <em>hope</em> OPPO/OnePlus will do.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s still a path where we don&apos;t see any significant upgrades. Instead, we could end up with what may essentially be a OnePlus Open 1.5 in 2025, resulting in the same feeling that we already get with slab phones and tablets. Or maybe OnePlus will still release the Open 2 later this year and opt for another iterative release instead of building on the momentum.</p><p>I&apos;m really keeping my fingers crossed that Oppo doesn&apos;t get complacent, as it really has a good thing going with the Open.</p>

<ul><li>A new Chromebook accessibility feature will allow users to control the mouse cursor and virtually map keyboard keys with facial gestures.</li><li>All Chromebooks are said to be getting the feature automatically in a future Chrome OS update.</li><li>We got to try it out in person at Google I/O 2024 on different Chromebooks, and an open-source preview is available on GitHub now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>All Chromebooks are getting a brand-new feature that lets users control their Chromebooks using just their faces. The new tool allows users to move the mouse cursor by tilting their heads, click by scrunching their lips, and even play games by smiling or shrugging their eyebrows.</p><p>Google I/O 2024 was certainly a year where AI reigned supreme, but this new AI-powered feature won&apos;t require specialized hardware or even a new Chromebook. It all works with your existing Chromebook&apos;s front-facing camera. Google calls the feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-project-gameface/">Project Gameface</a> and it&apos;s coming sometime this year, but you can try a preview of the open-source tool at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google/project-gameface">Project Gameface Github</a>.</p><p>The new accessibility feature is built with Google MediaPipe and was "inspired by the story of quadriplegic video game streamer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@gimpyggaming4287" target="_blank">Lance Carr</a>," making it possible to control the entire operating system without the need for traditional input tools or expensive head-tracking mice.</p><p>Google often launches new accessibility features for its Chromebooks and Android products, but features like this tend to be restricted to newer hardware with dedicated AI co-processors. Instead, this new feature will run on all Chromebooks, according to a Google representative at the show. That means you don&apos;t even need one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> to get it!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.78%;"><img id="PhvKgtoyyvXBoL76pNmZsG" name="project-game-face-goemetry-dash.gif" alt="Playing Geometry Dash on a Chromebook by smiling using Project Gameface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PhvKgtoyyvXBoL76pNmZsG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At Google I/O 2024, Derrek Lee (pictured above) and I got to try out the new feature running on two different brands of Chromebooks. One computer had the popular mobile game Geometry Dash running, and users could jump just by smiling at the camera.</p><p>Likewise, the other Chromebook was running the famous Chrome dinosaur game, and you would just need to shrug your eyebrows to make the dino jump.</p><p>The program supports gestures like open mouth, smile, scrunch your mouth to the side, look left, right, or up, and raise either eyebrow. These gestures can be mapped to any input action supported by the OS, like moving the mouse, clicking mouse keys or buttons, and even pressing key combinations. You can even invoke Google Assistant with any gesture to type with your voice and do anything else on the computer that Assistant can help with.</p><p>That made it possible for us to navigate the entire operating system using head movements to move the mouse cursor around. It&apos;s a bit like the way to control an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a>, except that you&apos;ll tilt your head to move the cursor on a Chromebook instead of looking where you want to click as on a Vision Pro.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Face gestures were incredibly responsive and worked very accurately on the Chromebooks we used.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Performance and accuracy is likely going to depend on the Chromebook used. The team seemed confident that it would be just fine even on the cheapest Chromebooks, though. In our demo, the performance was impressive and I was surprised at how quick and accurate the input gestures were. Playing something as twitch as Geometry Dash shows just how responsive this can be.</p><p>Lots of new accessibility features have been rolling out in 2024, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/first-things-to-do-with-your-meta-quest-3">live caption support</a> on the Meta Quest 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/?1715781602">eye tracking for iOS 18</a>, and Google launched an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-guided-frame-pixel-7">Guided Frame</a> feature on Pixel phones so vision-impaired users can use their Pixel&apos;s camera and have the phone describe what it sees. It&apos;s good to see more features like this rolling out to more and more phones, laptops, and other devices to help users with specific accessibility needs.</p>

That&apos;s changing with the introduction of the MM-100; like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">MM-500</a>, these headphones are made in collaboration with Manny Marroquin, and they&apos;re designed to be used mainly as a reference headset.</p><p>The biggest difference is that the MM-100 costs just $399, making it the most affordable Audeze headset you can buy at the moment. By contrast, the MM-500 retails for $1,699, more than four times as much. Having used the MM-100 alongside the MM-500 for the better part of two weeks, it is clear that the latter has a more refined sound, but the MM-100 comes close, and that is no small feat.</p><p>While Audeze uses a few plastic bits in the chassis, the MM-100 has a similar design and the same great build quality as the MM-500, and there are absolutely no issues in this area. Essentially, the MM-100 takes the best features of the MM-500, and brings it to a much more affordable price point.</p><p>If you&apos;ve been holding out for an affordable pair of Audeze headphones, your wait has come to an end. The MM-100 isn&apos;t just one of the best Audeze headphones — it is easily among the best overall options you&apos;ll find in the sub-$500 category.</p>

<p>Audeze unveiled the MM-100 in April 2023, with the headphones going on sale in the month of August. It&apos;s now available globally via audio retailers and Audeze distributors, and in North America, you can get your hands on the MM-100 for $399.</p><p>Considering the affordability of these headphones, there&apos;s longer-than-usual wait times. That&apos;s if you&apos;re buying straight from Audeze; you can also get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Professional-Open-Back-Headphones-Magentic/dp/B0C2BJ724T">MM-100 via Amazon</a>, where it is selling for the same $399. While most Audeze products have a standard three-year warranty, the MM-100 comes with a one-year warranty.</p>

<p>Other than the headband, there isn&apos;t much in the way of a difference between the MM-100 and MM-500. Audeze retained the same styling and design aesthetic, and you get a gunmetal grey color scheme that looks elegant. Audeze uses plastic in the construction of the ear cups, but the yoke and grilles are made out of a magnesium alloy, and the headband is fashioned out of steel.</p>

<p>The build quality is just as exquisite as costlier Audeze headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-lcd-x-review">LCD-X</a> and MM-500, and the best part is that the MM-100 is considerably lighter than other Audeze products I used thus far. Coming in at 475g, it is 20g lighter than the MM-500, and that difference is noticeable. Don&apos;t get me wrong; the MM-100 is still on the heavier side, but it is significantly lighter than most Audeze designs — the LCD-X weighs 612g.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bhv9MGmjeX6ph4J2ioSZSn" name="audeze-mm-100-3.jpg" alt="Audeze MM-100 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bhv9MGmjeX6ph4J2ioSZSn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As is the case with the rest of the brand&apos;s products, the grille has Audeze&apos;s distinctive stylized A logo on either side, with Audeze branding on the right and Manny Marroquin to the left. While the design is largely identical to the MM-500, Audeze switched out its standard mini-XLR connectors to 3.5mm, and that makes the MM-100 much more versatile. What&apos;s interesting is that you need to connect just one side to the cable, giving you the flexibility of plugging in the headset either via the left or right connectors.</p>

<p>The bundled braided cable is of a decent quality, but it doesn&apos;t have a sheath, and it ends in a 6.35mm plug — like most other Audeze headsets. I would have liked a 3.5mm plug considering the category the MM-100 is debuting in, because as it stands, the choice of plug limits its usability with portable sources.</p>

<p>Audeze went with a floating headband design with the MM-100, and it does a good job distributing the weight of the headset evenly. The only issue I have in this area is that the adjustability of the headband is limited; you can&apos;t move the stalk up or down, and you&apos;ll instead have to adjust the leather band between three notches. While this is an inelegant system, you won&apos;t have to adjust the band too many times.</p>

<p>The MM-100 is the most comfortable Audeze headset I used to date, and that includes the lighter LCD-GX gaming headset. A big part of that has to do with the clamping force; it isn&apos;t as high as the MM-500, and combined with the lighter design, the MM-100 is ideal for extended use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WZRTfi8mhbAJL4a6xVXga" name="audeze-mm-100-8.jpg" alt="Audeze MM-100 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WZRTfi8mhbAJL4a6xVXga.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ear pads have a faux leather finish, and they&apos;re extremely comfortable even after prolonged use. They don&apos;t have a vented design, but because of the inherent open-back nature of the MM-100, you get good ventilation. Overall, Audeze nailed the design brief with the MM-100, and the headphones have sturdy build quality and are light enough that you can wear them for hours on end.</p>

<p>With a sensitivity of 98dB/1mW and impedance of 18Ω, it&apos;s effortlessly easy to drive the MM-100, but like all Audeze products, you can make the most out of the planar drivers by pairing it with a decent source. On that note, the MM-100 uses the same 90mm planar magnetic drivers as the MM-500, and it has Audeze&apos;s Fluxor magnet array.</p><p>I used the MM-100 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a> most of the time, switching over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q7-review">Q7 Bluetooth DAC</a> to use with a phone. Any source that&apos;s able to deliver over 250mW of power should be adequate to drive the MM-100 well.</p><p>As for the sound, Audeze retained a similar tonality as the MM-500. The MM-100 has a good bass extension, and while the low-end is neutral, you get a good rumble that&apos;s enjoyable along with fast transients. The mids are where the MM-100 truly shines; it has a boost in the mid-range that gives added warmth and clarity to vocals, and it sounds fantastic.</p><p>The treble is clean and detailed, and while there is some sparkle, it doesn&apos;t sound harsh, and there is no sibilance. There&apos;s good dynamics and instrument separation — as you&apos;d imagine on a headset aimed at studio use — and the mid-forward presentation means the MM-100 is a great choice as a reference headset.</p>

<p>HiFiMan&apos;s Sundara continues to be a stalwart in this segment, and at $299, it is also a great value. It has a similar bass presentation as the MM-100, and you get a slightly higher treble elevation. That said, the MM-100 has a clear advantage in the mids, and I like the design a little better.</p><p>Sennheiser&apos;s HD660S2 is a good alternative as well if you need a reference headset. It is costlier than the MM-100 at $499, but you get a neutral sound that&apos;s ideal for studio use as well as casual listening sessions.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an affordable pair of Audeze headphones</li><li>You want headphones with an exquisite sound</li><li>You need a sub-$500 reference headset</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a lightweight headset</li></ul>
<p>The MM-100 is one of Audeze&apos;s most significant products to date. It has the same great design and build quality as the MM-500, and it sounds remarkably similar. Yes, Audeze made a few tweaks to the design to bring the cost of the headset down to $399, but the MM-100 doesn&apos;t look or feel like a budget product.</p><p>Like the MM-500, the MM-100 nails the technical presentation, and it has a good bass extension that allows mainstream music to shine. The energetic mids may not be to everyone&apos;s tastes, but it gives the headset a lot of character, and it has a good treble presence.</p><p>Ultimately, it&apos;s the value that gives the MM-100 a distinct advantage. It is designed as a studio headset, but it&apos;s just as comfortable for daily listening sessions, and the sound quality on offer makes it one of the best contenders in this category.</p>

These releases also serve as a way to deliver feedback to the brand over the latest additions heading to Android.</p><p>Google introduced the first preview build of Android 15 at the end of February, and followed it up with DP2 on March 21. Google rolled out the first public beta of Android 15 on April 11, following up with the second beta build on May 14 at its annual I/O event. </p><p>I installed the second public Android 15 beta on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> as soon as it became available, and I&apos;ve been testing it a few days now. While there wasn&apos;t a lot of excitement around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, there&apos;s plenty of new stuff in Android 15.</p><p>That said, a word of caution: the build is much more stable than earlier releases, but it isn&apos;t ready to be used as a daily driver as of now. I believe that will change with the next beta release — which is due in June — so if you&apos;re itching to try out the new features, you&apos;ll only need to wait a little while. With that out of the way, here&apos;s what&apos;s new in Android 15.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-release-timeline"><span>Android 15 release timeline</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog" name="android-15-schedule.jpg" alt="Android 15 release schedule" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a clearly defined timeline with its Android releases, and that&apos;s no different with Android 15. The preview builds ran until March, and we&apos;re now in the public beta testing phase of Android 15. With Google planning four builds, the beta window will run until July. </p><p>The stable build follows soon after, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> debuted in the month of August, Android 14 was delayed until October last year. That said, it is likely that Google will go back to its usual cadence this year, so a stable build should be available in August — I&apos;ll have more to share as we get more details.</p><p>While Google doesn&apos;t use codenames in public-facing documentation, all Android releases still have internal dessert codenames, and Android 15 is designated Vanilla Ice Cream. Like previous years, you can install the beta on Google devices, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5-review">Pixel 5</a> series isn&apos;t eligible — only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and upwards will pick up the update. Here&apos;s the list of devices:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>With the second public beta build, the Android beta program is making its way to the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, with most major manufacturers getting in on the action. If you have any of the eligible devices listed below, you can get started with Android 15 right now: </p>

<p>As usual, Samsung devices aren&apos;t on the list, and ASUS is a notable omission. If you have a Galaxy phone, you will need to wait several months before you can use Android 15; Samsung tends to roll out the beta once the next version of One UI is ready. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-private-space-gives-you-an-additional-layer-of-security"><span>Private Space gives you an additional layer of security</span></h2>
<p>This feature has been around on several Chinese skins, and I use it quite a bit whenever I&apos;m testing a phone running ColorOS. And with Android 15, Google is integrating Private Space into Android, so it will be available on all devices. </p><p>The feature allows you to lock sensitive apps locked away in a separate section that needs an additional layer of authentication. Once locked, these apps don&apos;t show up in the app drawer or the overview menu, and they&apos;re squirreled away inside a new user profile. Any data that&apos;s generated — photos, videos, and documents — is also hidden. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg" name="android-15-notifications.jpg" alt="Android 15 notification cooldown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notification cooldown is a great new feature that lowers the volume of incoming notifications when you get successive notifications from the same app. So if you&apos;re in a group chat and start getting constant notifications, Android 15 automatically lowers the volume of subsequent notifications. What&apos;s great is that you can select this setting for just conversations, or all apps. As someone who doesn&apos;t like getting many notification alerts (I use DND most of the day), this is a great new addition, and one that I will use to good effect.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-keyboard-vibration-gets-its-own-toggle"><span>Keyboard vibration gets its own toggle</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof" name="android-15-keyboard.jpg" alt="Android 15 keyboard vibration toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 is adding a system-wide toggle to enable or disable keyboard vibration. You could do this previously by going into a keyboard&apos;s settings and toggle the feature individually, but the option to do so at a system-wide level that works across keyboards is a good addition. Google is also integrating a slider that lets you adjust the intensity of haptic feedback, similar to what OPPO and other brands already do.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-brightness-slider-vibrates-now"><span>The brightness slider vibrates now</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff" name="android-15-brightness.jpg" alt="Android 15 brightness slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a bid to bring better feedback across the system, Google is adding haptic feedback to the brightness slider in Android 15. The effect is very subtle — it&apos;s not on the same level as the nav gesture intensity, but it is still great that you get some amount of feedback when adjusting the brightness.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-partial-screen-recording-lets-you-share-only-what-s-needed"><span>Partial screen recording lets you share only what's needed</span></h2>

<p>Google took its sweet time integrating a screen recorder into Android, and by the time it added it, all other brands had their own take on the feature, which was usually better. Anyway, Android 15 is getting an update that lets you take partial screen recording. Instead of recording the entire screen by default, you can now select to record an individual app, and it won&apos;t show the rest of the screen and notifications.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bluetooth-tile-is-actually-useful"><span>Bluetooth tile is actually useful</span></h2>

<p>Google moved the Wi-Fi and cellular connection tiles to a single tile called Internet, and it is a constant source of frustration as it adds another step if I just want to toggle my home internet on or off. By contrast, the Bluetooth tile — which could have actually benefitted with this functionality — was a standard toggle that turned the Bluetooth radio or on off.</p><p>Thankfully, Google is addressing this issue in Android 15, and a short press on the Bluetooth tile now pulls up a dialog box similar to the Internet one — you get to see your paired devices, and you have the ability to easily switch between devices, and there&apos;s the option to toggle Bluetooth connectivity. If you want to pair a new device, hitting the + icon at the bottom of the dialog box to pull up the Bluetooth settings page and connect a new device.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s One UI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> already use this system, and it&apos;s good to see Google baking it into Android.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-enables-edge-to-edge-displays"><span>Android 15 enables edge-to-edge displays</span></h3>
<p>With Android 15, apps can show content that covers the entire width of the display, so if you have the gesture recognition bar enabled at the bottom of the page, you&apos;ll see content on either side of it. This should make content look a little more immersive — particularly when you&apos;re using a tablet.</p>

<p>Google is lifting a feature that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> that switches whatever action you&apos;re doing on the inner screen to the cover screen when you fold a device. This is a very useful feature, and other foldables like the Honor Magic V2 also have it. With it being integrated into Android 15, we should see it heading to even more foldables in the future.</p><p>Multitasking is also getting an upgrade, and you can now save split-screen app combinations to launch both at the same time. </p>

<p>Google is making it easier for game and app makers to directly access the hardware, and the Android Dynamic Performance Framework consists of a set of APIs that allow better optimization, and in Android 15, Google is introducing a power-efficiency mode that&apos;s designed for "long-running background workloads." This is to ensure any background apps don&apos;t utilize more system resources than necessary.</p><p>In a similar vein, Google is rolling out new thermal thresholds that should make a difference with throttling. Even the latest phones with powerful hardware struggle with throttling issues in demanding titles, and I&apos;m excited to see if this change makes a difference in real-world use.</p><p>And as for the interface as a whole, Google is adding smoother transitions, so Android 15 should feel fluid if you&apos;re on a device that has a high refresh panel.  </p>

<p>Android 15 DP2 brings a new feature to the Pixel Fold and Android tablets that enables a persistent taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Other brands offer this feature as standard on their foldables, so it is good to see Google adding it natively in Android 15. </p>

<p>Another new feature in Android 15 DP2 is the ability to pay the same audio across multiple headphones — no need to share earbuds.

<p>The best part of Android is its sheer diversity; different brands have their own take on what Android should look like, and they roll out custom features that go above and beyond what Google offers on the Pixels. As I get to use all the flavors of Android, these are the features I want to see in Android 15 — that said, it&apos;s unlikely Google will include any of these in upcoming builds.</p>
<h2 id="floating-windows-2">Floating windows</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8" name="android-15-list-6.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ColorOS and MIUI rolled out floating windows three years ago, and it is a useful utility that lets you maximize screen real estate. Floating windows essentially lets you resize any app so that it fits on the display without taking up its entire width, and it can be overlaid onto another app, making it quite convenient to use. My best use case is launching the calculator in a floating window whenever I need to add up a few things, and it works exceedingly well in this situation.</p><p>If Google is looking to add floating windows to Android 15, it should consider looking at ColorOS&apos; implementation and not MIUI. In all its wisdom, Xiaomi thought it best to have floating windows enabled as default, with no way to turn off the feature. This means that whenever you pull down on a notification, it opens in a floating window, and I&apos;ve had several instances over the years where I inadvertently launched floating windows without meaning to.</p>
<h2 id="better-icon-customization-2">Better icon customization</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7" name="android-15-list-2.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google introduced themed icons in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> (albeit in beta), and two years after launch, the feature is still half-baked at best. The problem isn&apos;t down to Google, but devs — as this feature isn&apos;t mandated, most app makers still choose to ignore it, and it makes the home screen look less cohesive. Even well-known services like Evernote don&apos;t offer the feature, and while that&apos;s more to do with the state of Evernote, it&apos;s annoying to not have all icons utilize the feature.</p><p>While Google&apos;s at it, if it can roll out the ability to change icon shape and size, that would be fantastic. I&apos;m still annoyed at how little customization is available on a Pixel phone in this particular regard, and really needs to do better.</p>
<h2 id="screen-distance-2">Screen Distance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7" name="android-15-list-3.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Screen Distance is a clever new feature in iOS 17 that utilizes the front camera to determine if you&apos;re holding your phone too close to your eyes. The goal here is to reduce eye strain, and if the camera detects that you&apos;re using your device closer than 12 inches from your face, it triggers a full-screen alert asking you to move your phone or tablet further away.</p><p>This feature proved to be quite useful on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I found that I had a tendency to hold the phone a little closer at night. Screen Distance is designed to reduce risk of myopia in children, but if you tend to use your phone in bed a lot, it can be quite a handy tool. Google needs to bring a similar utility to Android, and given that it uses the camera to gauge distance, it shouldn&apos;t be hard to implement.</p>
<h2 id="better-always-on-display-2">Better Always On Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8" name="android-15-list-4.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s take on an Always On Display has always been lackluster, and Android 14 doesn&apos;t do much to change that. You only get the option to show time and date when choosing an always-on screen, and while you get notification icons at the bottom, there isn&apos;t any customization possible.</p><p>Other interfaces, meanwhile, offer extensive customizability in this area. I like the range of styles available in ColorOS and the fact that I can design my own pattern that shows up on the lock screen, and while One UI doesn&apos;t offer much out of the box, you can always install Good Lock and unlock a slate of customization options.</p>
<h2 id="app-cloning-2">App cloning</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8" name="android-15-list-5.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android brands give you the option to clone an app so you can run two instances of it. This is handy if you&apos;ve got two SIM cards and want to fully utilize messaging services like WhatsApp or Telegram, but you don&apos;t have the ability to do so on a Pixel phone. As it usually does, Google teased this feature in earlier Android 14 beta builds, but it was nowhere to be found in subsequent betas, and is missing on the stable version.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-much-more-to-come"><span>Android 15: Much more to come</span></h2>

<p>The Android 15 beta program is in high gear, and it&apos;s clear that it is a major release with plenty of great new features. </p><p>With the beta builds now available on devices outside the Google ecosystem, you can get started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">installing Android 15</a> right now. I&apos;d advise waiting until beta 3 — that&apos;s when the build usually hits platform stability, and is much more reliable. </p>

<ul><li>Following an interview with Google's Dave Burke, it seems that a previous demonstration of ChromeOS on Android was nothing more than a demo.</li><li>It appears as though the company was interested in seeing if the capability for Android to run ChromeOS through its AVF could work — and it can.</li><li>A previous demo was reportedly shown to corporate partners in private using a Pixel 8's display output capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is dashing any hope of ChromeOS arriving on Android as an interview with a notable member suggests it was just a test.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-on-android-proof-of-concept-3443722/">(Android Authority</a>), an interview with Google&apos;s Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Android detailed what&apos;s happening with ChromeOS and Android. Burke said that the company&apos;s "tech demo" of the Ferrochrome project was aimed to see its virtualization technology in action.</p><p>Burke added that the software could only get off the ground thanks to the AVF (android virtualization framework) introduced in Android 13. This framework delivered a safe environment for "highly" sensitive code.</p><p>What Google was playtesting was the secure computing side of Android. As Burke stated, most of it is reportedly done through TrustZone, which isn&apos;t "as safe as virtual machines." While TrustZone typically works off ARM CPUs, the virtual machines are a "cleaner, safer way to run compartmentalized secure code."</p><p>The tech demo was done through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, a software that Google has updated with a new AVF to run its graphical operating systems through a virtual machine. This capability comes with GPU acceleration, as well. However, the test was just a proof of concept to see if such capabilities <em>could </em>exist.</p><p>Google&apos;s Sameer Samat chimed in, stating that things often "start like this" at the company. Unfortunately, it seems anyone&apos;s hopes of ChromeOS on Android are squandered as Google has no plans of continuing — at least, for now.</p>

During a private event, users saw a Pixel 8 running the Chromium OS variant known as "Ferrochrome." The demo showcased the latest Pixel flagship utilizing its display output functionality through the OS.</p><p>There wasn&apos;t much else shown during the event aside from the device&apos;s (and the software&apos;s) capability to run the computing software.</p>

<ul><li>During its Android Health segment, Google highlighted a couple of updates for Health Connect for developers and user data.</li><li>The company is preparing to roll out background reads, which will let a developer's app take in a user's data to remain up-to-date when held in the background.</li><li>History reads lets users grant access to another app so it can take in their "historical" Health Connect data, which includes information well beyond 30 days prior.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re still busy unpacking all that Google had in store for I/O 2024, and this next bit stems from its "Android Health" segment.</p><p>The company is highlighting another string of updates that are primed for its Android health sector for users in a Developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/the-latest-updates-from-android-health-io-2024.html">blog post</a>. Google&apos;s Health Connect is preparing to pick up support for background and history reads. Regarding the former, the post states that the developer-focused feature will give their app the ability to read Health Connect data when in the background.</p><p>Google states that this will enable a developer&apos;s app to keep a user&apos;s information up-to-date without manual input from the user.</p><p>History reads enters as a feature that gives a developer&apos;s app some context so it&apos;s not starting from zero. Google states users will have the option to grant an app access to their historical data in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>. This is said to stretch beyond just the past 30 days.</p><p>While users may find both features useful, Google adds that developers must declare the permissions for them to appear. Users can accept or decline these permissions as Google ensures they control the data they share. If users no longer want to allow background or history reads, the options can be found in Health Connect&apos;s settings.</p><p>Google plans to roll out both new features for user data "later this year."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</a> is certainly one of the more expensive tablets out there, even despite being Samsung's last-generation premium offering. However, with 36% off the normal purchase price, buyers could stand to get a pretty great deal on this capable device.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s8/buy">Samsung - $1,099.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-14-6-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6494238.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="258668e6-81a0-4af3-b462-228112d6d21b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a high-performing tablet at a slightly lower price; you&apos;re looking for a tablet with a large screen that&apos;s still slim and lightweight; having a tablet that can run some games is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for the latest-generation tablet available and wouldn&apos;t mind paying more for the S9 Ultra;  you need a tablet with a 3.5mm jack.</p><p>Despite its age, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Ultra is a remarkably strong tablet, offering 8GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, along with a massive 11,200mAh battery. All of these make it able to handle most gaming applications, and the 14.6-inch Super AMOLED is great for everything from video streaming to working in the office (or maybe both at the same time).</p><p>While many of Samsung&apos;s devices land in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, most are from the company&apos;s newest generation. But if you don&apos;t mind going with the older generation and you go with this deal, you&apos;ll get a tablet that&apos;s almost as good as the S9 Ultra—without the $1,199.99 price tag.</p>
