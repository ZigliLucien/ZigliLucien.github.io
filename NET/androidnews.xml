<ul><li>Google confirmed in a new report that consumers cannot chase repairment options for the Pixel Watch 3.</li><li>Users must contact Support for a replacement device and are also encouraged to grab the Preferred Care insurance plan to cover damages.</li><li>The original Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 2 were not offered official Google repair services and a teardown video showcased its self-repair nightmare.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Consumers are still left without proper repair options for Google&apos;s Pixel Watch series — even with the third iteration.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> offers a unique glass-domed design for its watch face that makes it prone to damage. The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a> inquired about repair options for Google&apos;s latest smartwatch, but the answer wasn&apos;t favorable.</p><p>A Google representative stated that if your Pixel Watch 3 comes under harm, you can "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>As the publication notes, this information doesn&apos;t bode well for folks interested in repairing the device instead of grabbing a new one. An option like that would help consumers elongate the life span of their device, especially for an accidental scratch or a funky crown.</p><p>However, Google stated those interested in purchasing a Pixel Watch 3 are encouraged to grab Preferred Care. This device insurance will cover damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." It&apos;s worth mentioning that if you are chasing a replacement device with the insurance, Google will ask for $49 in service fees.</p>

<p>Not that we were holding our breath, but Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-wont-repair-pixel-watch-displays">hasn&apos;t offered repair options</a> for its smartwatch since the beginning. Users had taken to Reddit to voice their displeasure as the only option then (and now) was to replace the device completely. Moreover, the idea of Google repairing the watch or doing it at home has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-teardown-video">previously proven difficult</a>.</p><p>Self-repair part provider iFixit conducted a teardown of the Pixel Watch and showcased its sheer lack of repairability. Cracking the screen and attempting to pop on a new one was tedious and there was no way to replace its crown or button. </p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-warranty-option">lack of repair options</a> continued with the Pixel Watch 2 as it (once again) encouraged consumers to purchase the Preferred Care insurance plan.</p><p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> on August 13 during its hardware event. The device debuted packed with loads of health and fitness tools that should have runners feeling pretty good — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">maybe a little depressed</a>. Nevertheless, the watch is offered in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm with an estimated 36 hours of battery time with "Battery Saver" mode enabled.</p>

<hr>
<p>The later we get in August, the closer opening kickoff is, which is why YouTube TV is detailing some new features.</p><p>One of the highlights that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/latest-nfl-sunday-ticket-features/">YouTube TV discussed</a> today (August 20) is the inclusion of even more fantasy football stats for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The company states that users can link their Yahoo Fantasy accounts alongside those with NFL Fantasy accounts to their Sunday Ticket.</p><p>Users can open the side panel (Scores & Stats) when watching a game to see tabs like Teams, Scores, Stats, Key Plays, and Fantasy. The final tab shows your fantasy team&apos;s current matchup, points tallied, and player performance. In-depth player details are available for each team and tapping on each one displays a full breakdown.</p><p>The post teases additions, such as the future availability for users to view "key plays and multiview combinations" involving their fantasy lineup.</p><p>Those with the NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV can find the new Fantasy tab on their TVs and mobile. Those with access through YouTube will pick this feature up later this season on mobile, tablets, and the web. When the season starts, users can connect their fantasy account under the "Sports" tab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9119412">in your account&apos;s settings</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.44%;"><img id="M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-fantasy-tab.jpg" alt="The NFL Sunday Ticket prepares to rollout a "Fantasy" team tab for stats and scores." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="991" height="599" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiview shifts ahead this upcoming season as users can now "build" their own custom experience. YouTube states Sunday Ticket holders can create two, three, or four-game combinations on gameday. Additionally, YouTube TV&apos;s base plan members can choose to view "preferred" multiview configurations, which are chosen based on what&apos;s "local."</p><p>The Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV will have this upgraded multiview available on TVs, mobile, and tablets. For YouTube, multiview on mobile, tablets, and TVs will be ready at the start of the season.</p><p>YouTube then teased a few smaller additions that will join the NFL Sunday Ticket for kickoff. Those additions include a spoiler mode to hide scores, more playback controls (broadcast delay), and a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-gets-new-last-channel-shortcut">jump to last channel</a>" shortcut.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1113px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.91%;"><img id="ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-custom-multview.jpg" alt="YouTube TV is bringing "build a multiview" to the NFL Sunday Ticket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1113" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The video streaming service reiterated that football enjoyers (should) have access to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dual-column-tv-redesign-detailed">new TV UI redesign</a>. The company started rolling out this new dual-column approach earlier this year for YouTube TV subscribers.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/custom-multiviews-in-youtube-tv-let-you-pick-four-basketball-games-to-watch-at-once">build a multiview</a>" may sound familiar due to its rollout for the NBA League Pass and NCAA basketball in February. During its debut, YouTube stated users could browse and select from "four pre-selected games." The company explained that its custom multiview will try and have games available for you based on "expected" popularity.</p><p>This customizable multiview experience was said to grab additional live sports and it seems that&apos;s getting underway with the NFL in 2024. Sunday football starts September 8.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google quietly announced something that most people aren&apos;t going to pay any attention to, even though we all should; it&apos;s one of the most important things the company has done.</p><p>It has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-pixel-nest-fitbit-plastic-free-packaging/">stopped using any plastic materials</a> in the box of all Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit products.</p>
<p>This doesn&apos;t sound like a big deal, especially since the products themselves all have plenty of plastic parts, but it is. Plastic wrapping, trays, and inserts inside a box are the kinds of things that get thrown away as soon as you tear into the package. There is no real value in keeping them around because you don&apos;t need them to send a product in for a warranty claim.</p><p>Using plastic could be a good idea because it&apos;s almost infinitely recyclable. Unfortunately, it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/why-is-it-cheaper-to-make-new-plastic-bottles-than-to-recycle-old-ones/">more cost-effective to create new plastic</a> than it is to recycle it for many purposes — plastic can get ugly when recycled and some things need to look pretty. Especially when it&apos;s next to an expensive new phone like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Google did this. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-its-first-carbon-neutral-products/">Apple</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/sustainability/sustainable-materials/">Samsung</a> are working towards the same goal, and each says it should be able to make it happen by 2025. Apple and Samsung also sell about a bajillion more phones and other products every year than Google does. Google was able to do it earlier because it simply has fewer boxes to consider. I assume it&apos;s more cost-effective to use plastic because every company does it, and saving money is just as important as selling products, especially when you sell a lot of products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-4.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srNCFV47V4GVdhvZkNZ3km.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google switching from plastic to recycled paper products won&apos;t have as big of an impact as Apple or Samsung. It&apos;s still very important, though, because this brings the issue into focus. When consumers realize that this is a small change that&apos;s really good for the environment, companies like OnePlus, HMD, and others will look into doing the same. When enough smaller companies join Google, the amount of plastic being used will be far less, so less of it will end up sitting in the dirt at the landfill. </p>
<p>You should care about this. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-4-what-smartphone-sustainability-really-looks">Sustainability</a> is important because we have to live on this planet. We have to eat the food grown here, drink the water found here, and breathe the air here. We also raise our kids here, and nobody should want to leave things worse than we found them.</p><p>Companies like Samsung committing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-2022-sustainability">using recycled materials</a> in their phones is super important and we should appreciate those kinds of efforts. Smaller goals can be equally important and since they should be easier to pull off, we should expect them. </p>
<p>I&apos;m no hippie guy who wears only hemp and has a Save the Whales bumper sticker on my truck. But I do hunt, fish, and have a vegetable garden. I also have grandkids and I want this place to be as clean and healthy as possible for them to grow up in. </p><p>Sustainability should not be some tribal left vs. right or us vs. them issue.

<ul><li>Meta first-party studio Camouflaj revealed the first gameplay trailer for Batman: Arkham Shadow during Gamescom 2024 Opening Night.</li><li>It shows similar combat, enemy stalking, gadgets, and Detective Vision as the previous Arkham games.</li><li>The trailer also shows boss battles, traversing the world using a grappling hook, and familiar faces like Harleen Quinzel and Jim Gordon.</li><li>Batman: Arkham Shadow launches in October 2024, exclusively on Meta Quest 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After months of hints and a story trailer, Meta studio Camouflaj has shown off what it&apos;ll be like to step into a young Batman&apos;s boots and fight the mysterious Rat King. Turns out that a VR Batman LARP should be pretty darn fun!</p><p>During opening night at Gamescom 2024, we saw the official Batman: Arkham Shadow gameplay trailer (embedded below). In it, we see a first-person perspective on the traditional Arkham fight formula: Batman must whale on foes while dodging attacks and using gadgets to maintain his combo and earn more XP. </p><p>Since you don&apos;t have a birds-eye view anymore, Camouflaj shows a flashing arm symbol when Batman senses an attack coming from the side. And to attack foes, you&apos;ll have to match your controller attacks to the fist or arrow symbols that appear. You also see colorful flashes after hard punches, as well as tactical moves like the Batarang and grappling foes towards you.</p><p>In other words, you&apos;re no longer just tapping buttons and feeling invincible; you&apos;ll have to move skillfully to keep Batman alive.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dadLtfngQH8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Equally exciting, the Arkham Shadow gameplay trailer showcases the series&apos; famous Predator mode, where you lurk above the fray and must silently take out armed enemies one by one. We see glimpses of the player grabbing and choking foes, as well as hogtying and dropping foes off of gargoyles.</p><p>In-between battles, it appears you&apos;ll be able to freely traverse the world, running and leaping over gaps or grappling to new areas. The world itself doesn&apos;t look as open as Arkham City or Knight, matching closer to Asylum in its claustrophobic environment. That probably matches more closely to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>&apos;s processing power.</p><p>Despite the mobile VR headset&apos;s limitations compared to, say, a PS5 or Xbox Series X, the trailer graphics look fantastic compared to many Quest games. It explains why the game won&apos;t work on the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a>, which lacks the hardware power for a game this large and immersive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for non-VR fans of the franchise, Arkham Shadow — which takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum in the series timeline — won&apos;t be available on standard consoles. The gameplay is wholly designed for motion controls and VR, so you&apos;ll need a Quest 3 headset to experience it. </p><p>This has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/fans-complain-about-batman-arkham-shadow">angered some long-time fans of the franchise</a>, especially after Rocksteady&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> turned into a live-service experience. It looks like Arkham Shadow will capture the old single-player, story-driven Arkham Asylum experience far better.</p><p>Based on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">interview with Arkham Shadow&apos;s project leads</a> back in June, the game took inspiration from popular non-fighting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Quest games</a> like Beat Saber for its rhythm mechanics and Superhot for its time dilation. The goal is for the player to experience the "flow" of fighting as Batman, leaping from one enemy to the next and never getting caught out.</p><p>According to the developers, Batham: Arkham Shadow will be "the longest game Camouflaj has ever made." The gameplay trailer shows plenty of interactive cutscenes with famous Batman characters that will likely pad the runtime, as well as finding collectibles throughout the world.</p><p>The trailer ends by commanding you to "Become the Knight" once Arkham Shadow launches in October 2024. Any long-time series fans with a Quest headset will probably obey that command, as the trailer makes the game look extremely fun.</p>

<p>Earbuds with ear hooks are my jam! Their secure fit works well for my lifestyle, so I tend to gravitate towards them. The Skullcandy Push ANC Active has a great fit and is quite comfortable. The ear hooks don’t feel like they’re pushing into the back of your ears, and the hooks are thin enough that they don’t feel awkward when I’m wearing glasses.</p><p>I also like the mix of physical buttons and touch controls on the buds, both of which are responsive when you interact with them. You can access physical rockers on both earbuds, which control volume, track forward, and track back. Then, there are the touch controls on the skull area, which control play/pause and call functions.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the most important feature: the sound. These are good, all-around, everyday carry earbuds for those who lead an active lifestyle. They’re urban tuned, with bass hyped slightly, but not annoyingly so. Bass response is satisfying for an upper entry-level priced pair of buds. The issue I ran into was using the Bass Boost preset. Listening to bass-heavy tracks from my hip-hop workout playlists on Tidal, the Bass Boost preset caused distortion in the drivers. When I switched back to the Music preset, everything was fine.</p><p>With regard to the other frequencies, I found mids and highs to be well-presented and airy. These earbuds have a respectably sized soundstage, which was apparent when listening to the FLAC file of Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and the Tidal track “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST.</p>

<p>You’ll definitely want to take the hearing test found in the Personal Sound menu of the Skullcandy app (pictured in the gallery above) to get the best quality sound for your ears. If you still need to play a bit, the Custom setting on the Equalizer tile gives you a five-band EQ to further fine-tune the sound to your liking.</p><p>Overall, the Skullcandy Push ANC Active worked well for all of the genres I tried. From hip-hop to pop, folk, classical, and death metal, as I said at the outset, these are solid everyday carry earbuds.</p><p>ANC is decent at this price point. It effectively minimizes ambient noise in your environment, giving you some respite from low-frequency droning sounds like jet engines. However, you shouldn’t expect the level of noise-canceling you might get from some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">best ANC earbuds on the market</a>, especially in the higher-end frequencies.</p>

<p>These earbuds have ANC and an Ambient mode. Though they&apos;re clear and people talking to you are audible, the Ambient mode can be tinny sometimes. They&apos;re definitely not the best I’ve reviewed, but they&apos;re serviceable.</p><p>For Skullcandy’s audience, I don’t think this is an issue, but the case is huge compared to some competing products I’ve reviewed lately. It won’t matter if it is in a backpack or attached outside of a backpack by a lanyard.</p>

<p>As I stated previously, it’s all about what you want. There are offerings at this price point that I think have better sound quality but aren’t as stable or don’t have wireless charging.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Nothing Ear (a)</a> sound better with their support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Hi-Res Wireless Audio</a>, but are an AirPod-style pair of earbuds. They stay in my ears (AirPods don’t) but won’t be as “locked in” for dynamic gym use. It’s pretty much the same story with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC</a> with LDAC, but add in wireless charging.</p><p>Then there’s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-nord-buds-3-pro-review">OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro</a> which are $20 less than the Skullcandy Push ANC Active and I’d say have somewhat better sound quality but, like the Ear (a) won’t be as locked in. </p><p>Call quality is good in a quiet space, and it&apos;s actually pretty decent in mild traffic, but the heavier the traffic noise gets, callers on the other end may experience dropouts in the audio. Wind noise may exacerbate that issue.</p>

<p>If you have the sort of lifestyle that requires ear hooks and you want relatively inexpensive earbuds with wireless charging, these are for you. However, you may want to steer clear if you&apos;re looking for something with support for Hi-Res audio, and the bulky charging case is definitely a bit of a turnoff, even if it does have wireless charging.</p><p>Overall, the Skullcandy Push ANC Active is a good buy for those needing a rugged everyday carry pair of earbuds. There are some tradeoffs at this price point where overall sound quality is concerned, but for gym use and commuting, these should fit the bill for many people.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sivga isn&apos;t a brand most of you will be familiar with, but the Chinese manufacturer is slowly gaining momentum on the back of wood-based designs and custom tuning. Of course, Meze did the same thing a decade ago, and the 99 Classics continues to be a standout product. I reviewed the 99 Classics last year, and it didn&apos;t take long to realize that it is one of the best-sounding headphones in the sub-$500 category.</p><p>Sivga is following in the same path, and the Luan shares a lot of similarities to the 99 Classics. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SIVGA-LUAN-Detachable-Professional-Audiophiles/dp/B0C6D7WY8Z">costs $299 on Amazon</a> — just $10 less than Meze&apos;s offering — and has dynamic drivers and a wooden enclosure that looks great. The key difference is that the Luan offers an open back design, while the 99 Classics is closed-back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6" name="sivga-luan-14.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll get to the sound in a bit, but as always, let&apos;s start with the design. There&apos;s definitely a lot to talk about in this area, and the Luan stands out for its usage of wood; most products in this segment use a mix of plastic and metal, and there&apos;s just something inherently cool about headphones with a housing made out of wood.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4" name="sivga-luan-4.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan is available in two finishes, and the walnut model I&apos;m using is sublime. Sivga did a brilliant job with the design, and what I particularly like is that the headphones are color-matched to the wooden housing, so the earpads and the headband have a similar color scheme. The end result is that the Luan looks striking, and the design is pretty distinctive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4" name="sivga-luan-5.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sivga also deserves credit for using no plastic in the chassis of the Luan; the headphones feature an abundance of steel for the swivel mechanism and the headband, and the build quality is exquisite. There&apos;s a good amount of swivel, and the external grille has a standard mesh pattern. Basically, the Luan doesn&apos;t look or feel like a pair of headphones that costs just $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5" name="sivga-luan-8.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wooden housing is sanded down and polished, and after two months of extended use, the Luan shows no signs of wear. The headband has a leather insert with foam padding that does a great job distributing the weight, and even though the Luan weighs 354g, it doesn&apos;t feel like it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7" name="sivga-luan-7.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a decent amount of swivel to the earpads, and they&apos;re lined with velvet. The pads are large enough that there&apos;s no issue with sizing, and the foam inserts are extremely soft, ensuring they stay comfortable even after extended use. There isn&apos;t a lot of clamping force, and while the headphones have a snug fit, the plush pads ensure there&apos;s no fatigue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6" name="sivga-luan-12.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan connects via two 3.5mm plugs, and the other end of the cable has a balanced 4.4mm connector. The bundled cable is of a decent quality, and like the rest of the design, it is also color-matched to the headphones. The Luan is bundled inside a hard shell carrying case made out of leather, and it is one of the best cases you&apos;ll see in this segment. It does a great job safeguarding the headphones, and it has feet at the bottom that allows it to stay upright.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5" name="sivga-luan-13.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Luan has a neutral characteristic that lends itself well to a diverse range of genres. The bass is detailed and fast, but it doesn&apos;t have the same rumble as other dynamic driver-based designs in this category, so if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, you&apos;ll need to tweak the EQ. There is good definition overall, but a little extension in the sub-bass region would have made the Luan that much more immersive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85" name="sivga-luan-6.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mids have a natural presentation, and vocals come through clean and clear. The dynamics are fantastic, there&apos;s good instrument separation, and the Luan shines with ensemble pieces. The treble has good extension, and there&apos;s a sense of airiness to the mix, and while there is some sibilance at times, it isn&apos;t overly harsh.</p><p>The soundstage is among the best in this class, and Sivga didn&apos;t really put a foot wrong in this regard. The Luan does a great job with detail rendition, and while I would have liked a slightly elevated bass, that&apos;s the only quibble I have with the headphones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7" name="sivga-luan-11.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, Sivga did a magnificent job with the Luan. The headphones have a sublime design, and the generous use of wood and steel allows them to stand out from other products in this category. There are zero issues with the build quality, and the Luan is extremely comfortable in daily use. One of the main reasons I used the 99 Classics is because of the lightweight design and fit, and while the Luan is heavier, I didn&apos;t notice the added heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94" name="sivga-luan-2.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound also plays a big part, and the neutral signature along with excellent dynamics makes the Luan a viable contender to the likes of the HD6XX. Ultimately, if you want open back headphones with a neutral sound and an eye-catching design, you can&apos;t go wrong with the Luan.</p>

<ul><li>Launched in 2017, the Google Play Security Program will no longer be functional after August 31.</li><li>However, researchers can still submit security reports, which will be addressed until September 30.</li><li>Google cites a "decrease in actionable vulnerabilities reported" as the reason for its discontinuation.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><em>Updated 4:00pm ET with new comments from Google.</em></p><p>After seven successful years, Google’s Play Security Reward Program is ending on August 31. The company recently let developers know about the decision via email.</p><p>The program paid developers who found and disclosed vulnerabilities in Android apps, explained Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-security-reward-program-winding-down-3472376/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The program, which was fairly unique, has "achieved its goals," a Google spokesman told Android Authority.</p><p>"We greatly appreciate the security research community that helps keep Android users safe. The Google Play Security Reward Program (GPSRP) was the first program of its type to pay a bonus reward in addition to any applicable developer vulnerability reward programs. Launched to encourage app developers to establish their own security programs, GPSRP has achieved its goal after 7 years."<br>
<br></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Google kicked off the program in 2017 to encourage developers and security researchers to find vulnerabilities in Google’s websites, apps, Chrome and Chrome OS, and Pixel devices. Researchers who spotted and reported issues were rewarded with cash from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Though it did boost Android and Google Play security, the system is no longer necessary, Google told us. "As a result of our advancements in Android security features and OS hardening, we’ve seen fewer actionable vulnerabilities reported to the GPSRP program by the research community. Due to this decrease in actionable vulnerabilities reported, we are winding down the program."</p><p>"We encourage researchers to work directly with application developers should they discover potential security vulnerabilities," he added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH" name="google-play-security-rewards-program-email.jpg" alt="GPSRP discontinue email" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman/ via Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, the program will end on August 31; however, reports submitted before that period will be triaged by September 15, and final reward decisions are expected to be made before September 30. After that, the program will be "officially discontinued," the Android security team notes in the email.</p><p>The GPSRP was an extra step to gather vulnerability data and create automated checks. These checks would be applied to all Android apps on the Play Store to check for similar vulnerabilities and make the app store safer, even though Google already has its own set of measures to keep the Play Store safe for those many apps. Either way, it is about to end—for better or worse.</p>

The launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> showcased a subtle shift in the design language, with the chrome-accented design extending to cover the stalks as well as the driver housing. This led to a cleaner look, but what made those earbuds stand out is the sound quality.</p><p>OnePlus earbuds always had a distinct tonal characteristic with an exaggerated bass — so much so that the original Buds Pro drowned out other frequencies — but that changed with the Buds 3. The earbuds still had a good presence in the low-end and treble regions, but they had much better tuning, and that led to the Buds 3 having a distinct advantage over the costlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>That&apos;s the narrative behind the introduction of the Buds Pro 3. OnePlus is switching up the design of the case, and is rolling out sizeable upgrades to the drivers and tonal balance. The end result is that the Buds Pro 3 are the best-sounding OnePlus earbuds by a significant margin; they&apos;re not just the best that OnePlus made to date, but one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">best earbuds</a> you can buy today.</p>

<p>OnePlus introduced the Buds Pro 3 on August 20, and they&apos;re available now. The earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/product/oneplus-buds-pro-3">retail for ₹11,999 ($143) in India</a> — the same as the Buds Pro 2 — and they&apos;re going on sale in the country starting August 23. They&apos;re debuting at $149 in North America, and will go on sale at the same time. You can get your hands on the earbuds for $119, with OnePlus offering a $30 discount as a launch-week incentive.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VyDJN9FzcEcTLu4HjikYCN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyDJN9FzcEcTLu4HjikYCN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus hasn&apos;t changed too much on the design side of things, with the Buds Pro 3 featuring a subtle change instead. The glossy accents that covered a portion of the stalk on the Buds Pro 2 now extend all the way through the stalk and the driver housing, and it gives the earbuds a cleaner design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RUegZ7zBTAEqLdysdqLxXN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUegZ7zBTAEqLdysdqLxXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other key difference is the size; the Buds Pro 3 are larger than their predecessor, and while the driver unit is roughly the same size, the stalk extends out considerably. The result is that each earbud is a smidgen heavier at 5.28g (versus 4.9g on the Buds Pro 2), but even then, they&apos;re on the lighter end of the scale, and there&apos;s no fatigue whatsoever when wearing the earbuds for an extended duration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WtE9PBCrUrRijcUGH6ZYPN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WtE9PBCrUrRijcUGH6ZYPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The earbuds are available in two color choices — Midnight Opus and Lunar Radiance — and I got the latter. The Midnight Opus model is the way to go if you want earbuds that attract attention, but both variants have the same glossy texture. As you can imagine, the glossy coat is prone to smudges, and I would have preferred a variant with a matte texture.</p><p>There are four pairs of tips bundled in the package, with the medium size installed as default. The fit is just as snug as the Buds Pro 2, and the buds stay secure in the ear even during workouts, and there are no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EfBNdvYgRwtsdnynRFAsrK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EfBNdvYgRwtsdnynRFAsrK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there isn&apos;t much in the way of design change with the earbuds, OnePlus overhauled the case this time. Unlike the flat designs of years past, the Buds Pro 3 are encased in a pill-sized case that&apos;s noticeably larger, and what&apos;s interesting is that it is made out of faux leather. Most earbud cases I&apos;ve used are fashioned out of plastic or metal, so it is interesting to see OnePlus take this route.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TQScW3qcYesTiq22VaQY4K" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-22.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQScW3qcYesTiq22VaQY4K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The leather finish definitely makes the case look upmarket, but the downside is that it isn&apos;t as pocketable. There&apos;s still an LED indicator, but it is now located at the bottom next to the USB-C charging port, and there&apos;s a pairing button on the right that lets you connect the earbuds to your phone.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-pro-3-features"><span>OnePlus Buds Pro 3: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fgWC83n93tqLyhQ6CHcq2L" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgWC83n93tqLyhQ6CHcq2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus overhauled gesture controls on the Buds Pro 3, and there&apos;s a grooved texture at the bottom of the stalk of each earbud that serves as the gesture recognition area. Having a distinct texture makes all the difference in using gestures, and while the usual play/pause squeeze controls are easy to use, slider gestures — to control volume — are irksome, and I couldn&apos;t get these to register no matter how many times I activated the gesture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mxVEmPgq9RDZztB8ne3LbM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mxVEmPgq9RDZztB8ne3LbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The single and double press gestures trigger without any issues, and it&apos;s just the sliding controls that are finicky. That said, the gestures are significantly better than the Buds Pro 2; those earbuds had a limited recognition area, and gestures were so annoying to use that I didn&apos;t bother at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2VaESdVvR5iJU5p8u2nJBM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VaESdVvR5iJU5p8u2nJBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus added IP55 dust and water resistance to the Buds Pro 3, and they&apos;re great for workouts. While the earbuds have ingress protection, the same doesn&apos;t extend to the case, and OnePlus needs to rectify that with the next generation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CpF4swP82atcAFxBZDRCVL" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpF4swP82atcAFxBZDRCVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big talking point this time is adaptive ANC, which does a more effective job at blocking out external sounds. You can easily change the level of noise isolation, and there&apos;s a transparency mode that easily allows ambient noises to be audible. On the whole, ANC is terrific at blocking out everyday sounds like the hum of an AC, traffic noises, or any ambient sounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AUxAyjougWFbEVVARMkWsM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AUxAyjougWFbEVVARMkWsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It did a decent job muting the sounds of my keyboard, and there&apos;s a smart mode that dynamically adjusts the level of isolation based on ambient noise. At the other end of the scale, the earbuds have spatial audio, and while I&apos;m usually wary of manufacturers offering virtual surround sound, OnePlus is using Google&apos;s Spatial Audio tech as standard, instead of the custom solution that was used on the Buds Pro 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9tuKRKxrp7mB2aNdUMm86P" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-21.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tuKRKxrp7mB2aNdUMm86P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mode essentially mimics a sense of space, and as the earbuds now use Google&apos;s standard tech, they&apos;re available on a much wider variety of devices, OnePlus and otherwise. Rounding out the features, the earbuds have a latency of 94ms, but there&apos;s a gaming mode that lowers the latency considerably.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4kTywLYDrKkFjNzAyJQpZK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4kTywLYDrKkFjNzAyJQpZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Buds Pro 3 are larger than their predecessor, they house a slightly smaller 58mAh battery (the Buds Pro 2 had a 60mAh battery), and the case has a 566mAh battery of its own. It takes 70 minutes to charge the internal battery, and there&apos;s fast charging that delivers up to three hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><p>In my usage, I got just over five and a half hours of playback between charges, and that&apos;s in line with most other earbuds I&apos;ve used this year. With fast charging and the case&apos;s built-in battery, you&apos;ll only need to charge the case itself once a week on average.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="erYdpMu2X79mZLo263N3FK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/erYdpMu2X79mZLo263N3FK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Buds Pro 3 have dual audio drivers that include a 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter, and OnePlus says it redesigned the woofer to deliver better accuracy, and the tweeter has better range in the high-end. Like the Buds Pro 2, OnePlus collaborated with Dynaudio over the tuning of the Buds Pro 3, and there is plenty to like here.</p><p>The earbuds connect over Bluetooth 5.4, and I didn&apos;t have any issues pairing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, or the Pixel 9 Pro XL. What&apos;s great about the earbuds is that they have multipoint connectivity, so you can pair with two devices at once. That said, the biggest issue I have with the Buds Pro 3 is that they lack high-res codecs; you don&apos;t get any AptX or LDAC codecs, and that&apos;s annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KwhDXmiQMDz2zR94evYNYQ" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwhDXmiQMDz2zR94evYNYQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;re instead limited to SBC and AAC, and while there is LHDC, the codec isn&apos;t predominantly available in cast devices, so most of the time, you&apos;ll be left with SBC. LDAC has been standard on Android for just over five years now, and I don&apos;t see why OnePlus just didn&apos;t get a license to integrate it into the earbuds.</p><p>And as for the sound, it&apos;s safe to say that these are the best-sounding OnePlus earbuds by a sizeable margin. They still follow a V-style signature to the sounds with either end of the frequency boosted, but that doesn&apos;t color the mid-range to any meaningful degree, and the overall sound quality is among the best in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EiVS6yxpWSHdJgR6jC8PQK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-24.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EiVS6yxpWSHdJgR6jC8PQK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a delightful rumble in the low-end, and the bass has plenty of energy and vigor. But it isn&apos;t anywhere as exaggerated as previous models, and doesn&apos;t bleed into the mids. The treble is also much more detailed, and you get clear highs with a good amount of extension without noticeable sibilance. The mids have good dynamics, and vocals come through clear.</p><p>On the whole, there&apos;s a noticeable shift in the sound tuning, and OnePlus did a lot of the right things in this area. You also get custom modes to tweak the sound balance, and these can be accessed via HeyMelody if you&apos;re using a non-OnePlus phone. What I like is the ability to tweak the EQ, and if you like a balanced sound, lowering the sub-bass and boosting the mids a little makes these earbuds shine.</p>

<p>I really like Creative&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Aurvana Ace 2</a>; they use an innovative solid-state driver to deliver clean highs, and it makes a difference in daily use. The overall sound is among the best of any earbuds, and they are a great value at $119. They don&apos;t miss out on any of the extras either, and you get the entire suite of AptX codecs.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need lightweight earbuds</li><li>You want powerful sound with good customizability</li><li>You need good noise isolation</li><li>You want IP55 ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need AptX codecs</li></ul>
<p>Overall, there isn&apos;t much to fault with the Buds Pro 3. OnePlus made all the right changes with the earbuds, and it&apos;s the sound quality where there&apos;s the biggest difference; while earlier models were squarely aimed at bassheads, the Buds Pro 3 have a much better tuning, and can be used across a variety of genres.</p><p>I also like the tweaks to the design and the case. The sound is inherently customizable, so if you miss the bass-heavy tuning of previous generations, you can make the requisite changes to the EQ. The earbuds are light enough that you don&apos;t notice them even after extended use, and battery life is great.</p><p>The only issue is that you don&apos;t get AptX codecs, but outside of that, the Buds Pro 3 are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">best earbuds</a> available today.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is bringing AI to lower-priced smartphones with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">7 Plus Gen 3 launched earlier this year</a>.</p><p>The Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 packs some of the AI power of the 7 Plus Gen 3 into a more affordable chipset, making advanced generative AI features accessible to more smartphones.</p><p>Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 introduces performance boosts all around.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is one of the best flip phones you can buy right now. It has a high-performance Snapdragon chip, a new 50MP wide-angle camera, and plenty of AI features to enhance your experience. But as with every new phone you buy, it&apos;s gonna take some setting up, and even after you move your data over and swap SIM cards, there are quite a few things you&apos;re gonna want to do to ensure you&apos;re getting the best possible experience.</p><p>As such, we&apos;re going to go through some of the first things you should do when you get your new Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-and-set-up-ai-features"><span>Enable and set up AI features</span></h2>
<p>One of the main highlight features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is Galaxy AI, with Samsung adding even more capabilities than it announced for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. Finding these features is pretty easy since they&apos;re largely connected in one option in the Settings menu. Simply open <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai"><strong>Galaxy AI</strong></a>. Here, you&apos;ll see a list of the available features on the Galaxy Z Flip 6:</p>
<ul><li>Call assist</li><li>Chat Assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note assist</li><li>Transcript assist</li><li>Browsing assist</li><li>Photo assist</li><li>Drawing assist</li><li>Photo ambient wallpaper</li><li>Health assist</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll want to dive into each of these options and enable the features you want. You can also select just about any one of them to download language packs that will be used across your Galaxy AI features. This will be very useful for translation or transcription features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.61%;"><img id="ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-AI-Menu-One-UI-6-1-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy AI menu on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3440" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Below all of these features, you&apos;ll find a toggle that will let the Galaxy Z Flip 6 <strong>Process data only on device</strong>. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>, none of what you do will be sent to the cloud for processing, which some users may prefer for privacy reasons. The downside of this is that it may limit the capabilities of some features, or you may not be able to use them.</p><p>Beyond Galaxy AI, you also have AI features from Google, such as Circle to Search. You can activate this specific feature by going to Settings > Display > Navigation bar and tapping the toggle for Circle to Search. You can also enable Magic Composer and Gemini in the Google Messages app, as well as additional photo editing features in Google Photos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-customize-your-cover-screen"><span>Set up and customize your cover screen</span></h2>
<p>One of the best reasons to buy a flip phone is that you get to use the cover screen for various interactions. But before you do, we suggest setting up your cover screen just how you like it so you can prioritize the things that matter most.</p><p>On the Galaxy Z Flip 6, the easiest way to customize the cover screen is from the main display. Head over to <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <strong>Cover screen</strong>. From here, you can perform the following actions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Manage your cover screen wallpaper</strong>: Change to wallpaper to one of the preloaded options or add a new one, the latter of which gives you a large selection of customizable wallpaper options.</li><li><strong>Widgets</strong>: Manage which panels you want to appear on your cover screen. Many of these are first-party panels from Samsung, with the exception of Spotify.</li><li><strong>Notification options</strong>: Here, you can choose whether or not to show notifications, turn on the screen for incoming notifications, or set your <strong>Quick responses</strong> for certain notifications.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also worth noting that you can add multiple widgets per panel. On your cover screen, press and hold the display and swipe all the way to the right. Press the <strong>+</strong> button to add a widget and select the first option, which should prompt you to open the phone. From there, you can select which widgets you want and the sizes you want them in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-ai-to-change-your-wallpapers"><span>Use AI to change your wallpapers</span></h2>
<p>Changing your phone&apos;s wallpaper is one of the easiest ways to personalize your device, but now companies are throwing AI into the mix. Samsung began letting users create Generative AI wallpapers with Android 14, and the company continues to expand the feature, which now works on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3362px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.36%;"><img id="EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ" name="Creating-Generative-AI-wallpaper-Samsung.jpg" alt="Creating a generative AI wallpaper on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3362" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We have an in-depth guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">creating a generative AI wallpaper</a> on your Android phone, and the feature works more or less the same between Samsung and Pixel devices. Press and hold the home screen, then select <strong>Wallpaper and style</strong>. Tap <strong>Change wallpapers</strong> and select <strong>Create with AI</strong>. From there, you can choose between generative wallpapers, where you input options in preset prompts, or you can create Photo ambient wallpapers for your lock screen, which changes your photo based on the time and weather.</p><p>Again, both options are now available for the cover screen, but you&apos;ll have to go to the <strong>Cover screen</strong> settings menu to change your wallpaper.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-good-lock-for-extra-customization"><span>Download Good Lock for extra customization</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Good-Lock.jpg" alt="Good Lock on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Good Lock is a very handy app for any Samsung Galaxy phone owner. It gives you tons of customization options, which can be a bit overwhelming, but after some fiddling around, you&apos;ll be able to drastically change the look and behavior of your phone.</p><p>You can download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> from the Galaxy Store or the Play Store. Once you do, open the app and select any of the modules to install. Be sure to read the descriptions so that you know what each module does. However, there&apos;s one particular module you&apos;ll definitely want to install, and we&apos;ll explain it in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-cover-screen-apps"><span>Set up cover screen apps</span></h2>
<p>Did you know you can use apps on the cover screen? Samsung does not promote this because it wants to focus on the curated widget experience, but it&apos;s possible, and there are two ways to do it. We have a dedicated guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">how to use apps on your Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a> that you should check out, but in a nutshell, there are two ways to do it.</p><p>First, you can access a select few apps to use on the cover screen through the <strong>Labs</strong> option in the <strong>Advanced features</strong> menu. Some popular ones are available, but unfortunately, they&apos;re very limited. Instead, you&apos;ll want to use Good Lock to have a much better experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.09%;"><img id="7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-how-to-set-up-cover-screen-widgets-with-good-lock-2.jpg" alt="How to set up cover screen widgets on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2595" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll want to use the MultiStar module in the Good Lock app to enable the use of other apps you&apos;ve downloaded. This will give you a new Launcher widget that you can add to your cover screen, and you can even rearrange your apps just how you like them. Once you do, add the Launcher widget to your cover screen and arrange it where you want among your other panels. Again, you can access the guide linked above to learn more about how to enable this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now you have access to your apps from your cover screen, although there are some limitations to this method, as not everything is supported. Still, it&apos;s a good way to use your phone without opening it.</p>
<p>You can also use this same mode in vertical orientation by just setting the phone down and pointing it at your desired angle. This way, you can easily capture some social media videos for TikTok or Instagram.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-flex-mode-panel"><span>Set up the Flex mode panel</span></h2>
<p>One of the cool things about having a modern flip phone is the ability to fold it at an angle, which can make it easier to watch content if your hands are tied. Samsung takes this a step further by offering what&apos;s called a Flex mode panel, which adds various controls to the bottom half of the screen. Among those options are a giant touchpad, zoom slider, split screen toggle, quick settings button, screenshot button, settings button, and brightness and volume sliders. When content is playing on apps like Disney Plus or YouTube Music, it&apos;ll also present a timeline scrubber and rewind/fast-forward buttons.</p>

<p>You can find this option by navigating to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Flex mode panel.</strong> When enabled, folding the phone at an angle while an app is open will present a small icon in the bottom left corner. When pressed, it will open the Flex mode panel. However, in the settings, you can have this appear automatically when you fold the phone at an angle, but you&apos;ll have to do this on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that some apps, like YouTube, provide their own custom layouts, so if you set the Flex mode to turn on automatically, it will override those layouts. </p>

<p>The Interpreter app is probably one of the most useful in Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI arsenal. It makes it easy to communicate with people in person or over text, but there are ways to access either method. If you set up Galaxy AI in the earlier step, you may have noticed this as an option.</p><p>For in-person interactions, open the Interpreter app and set up the languages you&apos;re communicating with at the bottom of each section (or at the bottom of the screen if the phone is folded). On the top half is the other person&apos;s language, and the bottom half is yours. <strong>Tap the hamburger menu</strong> in the corner and the <strong>Settings icon</strong> to download more language packs, set up voice styles, and enable Tap to talk or Auto record when the mic is on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-translator-02.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 interpreter mode cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The three options in the top right corner of the main screen are incredibly useful. The first lets you flip the top half so the other person can batter read the text on your phone without needing to be next to you. The second option lets you fold the phone in a 90-degree angle so text can be displayed on the cover screen. The final option will display your history.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-chat-assist-translation-german.jpg" alt="Using Chat Assist translation on the Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3608" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about text conversations? Samsung has that covered, too. You can check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist guide</a> for a more in-depth look at how to navigate Interpreter features when texting, but you will need to enable Samsung Keyboard for this to work.</p><p>Essentially, it will automatically translate whatever you is typed in a chat, and you can set the language on a per-chat basis if you communicate with people who speak different languages. It&apos;s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 camera isn&apos;t bad, but it could be better. Its high dynamic range is lacking and can leave the sky overexposed in many photos. But fear not because Samsung has an app that can greatly improve things. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant</a> app is available to download in the Galaxy Store, and once installed, you can access it via the app icon or directly from your Camera settings, where you should see "Camera Assistant" as an option.</p><p>Once installed, I recommend enabling <strong>Auto HDR</strong>, which should improve the output of your photos. I also recommend turning on the <strong>2x crop zoom shortcut</strong> for an easy zooming option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are the main features I recommend, but there are plenty of options you should fiddle around with, such as the <strong>Quick tap shutter</strong> and <strong>Distortion correction</strong>. Take some time to go through the app to figure out what works for your imaging needs.</p><p>Also, there is one more thing you should do with the camera that isn&apos;t in the settings...</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and"><span>Fold the Galaxy Z Flip 6 90-degrees, and...</span></h2>
<p>In the camera app, switch to video mode and fold the phone to a 90-degree angle. The phone will open into a "hidden" Auto Camcorder Mode, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. You&apos;ll see that the viewfinder shrinks to the top-half of the phone with a minimal UI and standby/recording indicators. The bottom half where your hand will hold the phone, also simplifies the UI with a zoon slider, pause/stop button, shutter button, camera switch button, and flash toggle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.62%;"><img id="etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-camcorder-mode-UI.jpg" alt="The Auto Camcorder UI on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2595" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This UI makes it easy to use the phone like a camcorder, and your thumb lets you easily zoom in and out while recording without having to really move your hand. It&apos;s a handy feature for recording, as it allows you to hold the phone steadily.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs $100 more than previous generations of the Flip series. Thus, that gives you more reason to protect your phone with accessories.
