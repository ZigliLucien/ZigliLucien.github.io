                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I began reviewing the Garmin Forerunner 165, I was worried that it would feel too much like a downgrade compared to my long-time Forerunner 965 watch. I told myself not to hold any shortcomings against it since Garmin designed it as a budget running watch.</p><p>Instead, I found that the Forerunner 165 outperforms its price; it hardly feels cheap at all. </p><p>Garmin&apos;s first attempts at sub-$300 watches with AMOLED displays — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> and Vivoactive 5 — put more emphasis on a mainstream design that appealed to non-Garmin fans. The Garmin Forerunner 165 looks cheaper, but it feels more like a watch built <em>for</em> Garmin fans who want to save some money, and it&apos;s that distinction why it&apos;s already on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> today.</p><p>That being said, Garmin did disable a running feature on the Forerunner 165, most likely to make its $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> look more appealing. Whether you can save money with the 165 or not will depend on how much of a data-driven runner you are. </p>

<p>Released on February 20, 2024, the Garmin Forerunner 165 costs $249.99, while the Forerunner 165 Music costs $299.99. The latter version includes 4GB of music storage space and Wi-Fi support—the base 165 relies solely on Bluetooth—but has no other differences. </p><p>For context, the 165 Music has about 3.5GB of <em>actual</em> space for your Spotify, Deezer, or Amazon Music playlists — or your MP3 files. I could fit about 500 songs from my personal library via the Garmin Express desktop app. However, this will vary based on the size and quality of your music files. If you want more space, the Forerunner 265 Music has 8GB of storage, while the Forerunner 965 has 32GB for music and maps.</p><p>Both versions of the Forerunner 165 ship in Black or Mist Gray cases, with dual-tone Slate Gray or Whitestone silicone bands, respectively. Only the Forerunner 165 Music has more colorful options: a Berry case with a Lilac strap or a Turquoise case with an Aqua strap. </p><p>Garmin uses 20mm Quick Release bands for the Forerunner 165, meaning they&apos;re easily swapped out by pulling a tab. You can buy replacement straps of any color in silicone ($39.99 each), nylon ($69.99), or leather ($69.99) from Garmin directly, or look at third-party options. </p>

<p>If you&apos;ve owned a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Garmin Forerunner watch</a> before now, you generally know what to expect from the 165. It&apos;s easy to take Garmin&apos;s algorithm for granted, but you still won&apos;t find rival brands that can recommend a customized daily run that takes your current fitness and fatigue levels into account.</p><p>In my case, I rarely <em>select</em> daily suggested workouts like the one above because I like having a little flexibility without the Forerunner watch buzzing my wrist if I go off-pace. But it almost always inspires my choice of how hard to run and whether to stick to my neighborhood, jog to the track, or take a longer route loop.</p><p>To get this guidance in a $250 running watch with no monthly subscription is particularly special, knowing that most Garmin watches have the durability and post-launch software support to make them last for a few years, at least. Case in point, the 2015 Forerunner 235 and 2019 Forerunner 245 are still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watch-from-2015-most-popular-on-strava">most popular watches on Strava</a>.</p><p>I predict that the Forerunner 165 could eventually take that spot for a number of reasons — starting, obviously, with the low price compared to most Garmin watches.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> has been my daily watch for about a year, and I&apos;ve gotten used to its weight and thickness in exchange for the 23-day battery life and a 1.4-inch display. Once I switched to the Forerunner 165, which is half an ounce lighter and 1.6mm thinner, I suddenly remembered why I prefer lighter watches during long runs. </p><p>The Forerunner 165 design isn&apos;t what I&apos;d call stylish, but that&apos;s true of most Garmins, and I care more that my wrist feels pleasantly light wearing it. I become more aware of the 965 whenever I hold my wrist up to check my pace, but the 165 falls out of my perception more quickly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qJmYEsqBv7QpPUcm9FV7K4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-side-wrist-view.jpeg" alt="Close up view of the Garmin Forerunner 165 case and band on the author's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJmYEsqBv7QpPUcm9FV7K4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m also a fan of its lug-heavy silicone band for a secure and breathable fit that&apos;s not overly tight — even if I&apos;ve noticed that the 965&apos;s silicone band seems slightly softer and more flexible. One could wish that Garmin offered a nylon upgrade at checkout instead of making you pay an extra $70, but I&apos;ve gotten used to this moisture-wicking option.</p><p>The Forerunner 165&apos;s thin size and AMOLED display do affect its battery life, but I&apos;ll point out that plenty of past Forerunners like the 245 and 745 — which cost the same or more — only lasted a week per charge, despite the MIP displays. The Forerunner 165&apos;s 11-day battery with a more readable display is definitely an improvement, within the typical range for most cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a>.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit that 17 hours of all-systems GNSS tracking is on the low side for a Garmin watch, and it does require more frequent charging than I&apos;ve grown accustomed to with daily runs or walks. But it&apos;s about context: it&apos;ll still feel game-changing to non-Garmin users, there&apos;s no possible way it&apos;ll die on you during a race, and you can always pay for pricier Forerunners if the extra battery is a necessity.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-run-power-zones.jpeg" alt="The post-run Run Power Zones on the Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-745-review">Forerunner 745</a>, or any other Forerunner more than a few years old, then the Forerunner 165 will feel properly next-generation, with hardware upgrades that any runner would appreciate.</p><p>For starters, you switch from a memory-in-pixel (MIP) non-touch display to a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen with superior resolution — 390 x 390 versus 208 x 208 with the Forerunner 55. While this does cut three days of battery, I find that reading notifications and fitness charts without squinting becomes significantly easier, especially indoors, where MIP displays look dim unless you crank the backlight.</p><p>More importantly, you get the Elevate v4 sensor, which is capable of registering heart rate variability (HRV) for stress and more functional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> recharge data. Yes, it&apos;s not the newer v5 sensor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> with ECG and skin temperature, but that&apos;s a tall ask for a cheaper watch. As far as I&apos;ve seen in tests against chest heart rate straps, Garmin&apos;s v4 and v5 tech are comparable for core heart rate accuracy, and other (more expensive) Forerunners like the 965 use v4 as well. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The AMOLED display, accurate GNSS tracking, and reliable heart rate data make the Forerunner 165 feel truly next-gen compared to past Forerunners. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Plus, of course, Garmin gave the Forerunner 165 access to an all-systems GNSS mode that pulls from GPS, GALILEO, and GLONASS simultaneously. Having two satellite signals prevents inaccurate workout data in most contexts, even if it can&apos;t pinpoint quite as well as dual-frequency GPS on the pricier Forerunners. If you&apos;ve made do with GPS-only up until now, you should appreciate the improved results (which I&apos;ll discuss in the next section). </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Pt4YVkQpX6oHLGDoYcqyPm" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-workout-benefit.jpeg" alt="The estimated workout benefit for a daily suggested workout on the Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pt4YVkQpX6oHLGDoYcqyPm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The updates don&apos;t stop there: the Forerunner 165 has an altimeter for judging elevation gain, something missing from the Forerunner 55 and more recent Vivoactive 5. It&apos;s a must-have for runners since inaccurate elevation data means your watch can&apos;t attribute higher heart rates to hills, skewing your VO2 Max results. </p><p>In addition, if you like to download GPX files for offline courses, only the Forerunner 165 has a compass for breadcrumb navigation. There isn&apos;t enough room for topographical maps like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> has, but Garmin treats that as a premium feature, so the 265 doesn&apos;t have this either.</p><p>On the software side, the Forerunner 165 isn&apos;t that different from the 55; plenty of my favorite Garmin training metrics require a 265 or 965 upgrade. You do, at least, see post-run Training Effect data showing its aerobic or anaerobic impact, and you can cross-train with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">indoor workouts</a>. </p><p>You even get wrist-based running power and form analysis, which isn&apos;t especially helpful for amateurs unless you have a running coach or pro group to contextualize the data. I&apos;m more grateful that the Forerunner 165 added audio prompts, shouting out mile times so you&apos;re not constantly checking your wrist.</p>

<p>Last month, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">tested the Forerunner 165 against COROS and Fitbit trackers</a> for GPS, elevation, step, and heart rate accuracy. I&apos;m going to summarize the results here, along with some supplemental info. </p><p>For step count, it tracked 6,016 steps after 6,000 actual steps, tracked with a physical pedometer. The next closest was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> (91 steps above), with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> nearly 200 steps short of the actual total. It proved that the Forerunner 165 does the best for basic tracking if you&apos;re passionate about getting 10,000 steps a day.</p>

<p>For GPS accuracy, I weighed its All-Systems GNSS mode against the COROS PACE 3 dual-frequency mode, which (on paper) should be more accurate. My run maps above disabused this notion: my Garmin Forerunner 165 (pink) consistently stayed on the trail most of the time, while the COROS PACE 3 (orange) frequently strayed off the path. Their ultimate distance result — 5 miles for Garmin, 5.02 for COROS — wasn&apos;t that different, however.</p><p>(The Fitbit Charge 6&apos;s "Dynamic GPS," which combines results from its built-in satellite and my phone location data, was so erratic that I didn&apos;t bother cluttering my maps with the results).</p>

<p>During a subsequent mile-long track run in the third lane, the Garmin Forerunner 165 measured the correct 1,660-meter distance, while the actual GPS line had me drifting into left lanes before turns, filling the coverage gap. Again, COROS looked significantly worse on the map but had a similar distance total, while Fitbit&apos;s wonky GPS-only data (blue) was both inconsistent and 35 meters short.</p><p>Analyzing these results, it&apos;s clear that Garmin&apos;s mid-tier location tech is better than its rivals&apos; top-tier results. I can&apos;t say whether Garmin&apos;s GPS-only watches are as unreliable as the Fitbit Charge 6 was, but assuming they are, your post-run pace and distance might be significantly off. The Forerunner 165 and its All-Systems GNSS could make a real difference in un-skewing your training data.</p>

<p>As for heart rate accuracy, you can check how the Forerunner 165 results compared to the Polar H10 chest strap across a five-mile run (above) and during a track workout (below). </p><p>For a standard run, the Forerunner 165 was consistently accurate for nearly the entire run, with the same average and minimum heart rates and only a 1 bpm difference for max heart rate. It kept up with the Polar H10 when my heart rate rose quickly on hills but did lag slightly at catching my <em>falling</em> heart rate on downhills.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1880" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the track run, I alternated between sprints and jogs to see how well the Forerunner 165 could handle rapid changes in heart rate — a problem with wrist-based optical sensors.</p><p>The Forerunner 165 average bpm was only 1 bpm higher than the Polar H10, and the chest strap had a visible glitch with deflated results early in the workout, so I&apos;d say they were very close. That said, you can definitely see how the Forerunner 165 lagged behind the Polar H10 during those sudden changes, both for heart rate increases and decreases.</p><p>I won&apos;t include the other heart rate charts here, but the Fitbit Charge 6 stayed mostly in lockstep with the chest strap during both runs, beating the Forerunner 165, while the COROS PACE 3 matched Garmin during the five-mile run but lagged even worse during the track run.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-polar-h10-coros-pace-3-and-fitbit-charge-6-on-table.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 165, COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Polar H10 sitting together on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, you can&apos;t fault these results in a $250 watch, especially the steps, elevation, and GPS distance. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Weeks of Forerunner 165 testing have me confident that it's as accurate for heart rate and GPS data as costlier running watches.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Only Fitbit does better in this price range for heart rate, but the poor location tracking offsets the benefits. I haven&apos;t found that the pricier Forerunners are any more accurate for heart rate, either, and even though the Forerunner 165 lags a bit for rapid heart rate changes, it averages out to the correct result in the end. If you want more accurate heart rate results than this, don&apos;t look at pricier running watches: Look at the Polar H10 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS heart rate monitor</a>. </p>

<p>For further context, I finished a 5K run of my neighborhood loop wearing the Forerunner 165 and 965 to check the gap in results between the $250 and $600 models. As you can see, my heart rate average was identical, a predictable but welcome result given that both use the Elevate v4 sensor. </p><p>Location accuracy is the minor sticking point. The Forerunner 165 measured an extra 0.02 miles after 3.1 miles, which skewed my pace by a second. It&apos;s fair to assume the Forerunner 965 is more accurate thanks to dual-frequency tracking, but it&apos;s also fair to note that this gap is minimal compared to GPS-only watches that&apos;ll be off by half a minute per mile.</p><p>Unless you frequently run near tall buildings or under dense foliage — which would make dual-frequency GPS especially helpful — I&apos;d say that you can probably make do with the Forerunner 165&apos;s all-systems GNSS.</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t already tell, I really like the Garmin Forerunner 165, and I think most runners will, too. That said, it has plenty of compromises compared to the pricier models, with Garmin tantalizing you with missing features and cutbacks to upgrade to the 265. </p><p>On the design side, its polymer materials are rugged and lightweight, but you won&apos;t get an MIL-STD-810G rating like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, and its "chemically strengthened glass" isn&apos;t as scratch-proof as the 265&apos;s Gorilla Glass 3 treatment, nor as immune to reflections as the 965&apos;s Gorilla Glass DX. </p><p>More importantly, its plastic, button-heavy look isn&apos;t attractive; that also applies to other Forerunners, to be fair, but I want to make that clear for people who haven&apos;t grown accustomed to the Garmin aesthetic and prefer aluminum or steel casing.</p><p>Visually, the 1.2-inch display is bright enough, and since Garmin&apos;s UI doesn&apos;t do anything complicated, the Forerunner 165&apos;s thick bezel is more of an aesthetic issue than a functional one. </p><p>With its focus solely on health, sleep, and fitness tracking, the Forerunner 165 will feel substandard to anyone who likes powerful smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</a>, which costs $50 more and gives you a full series of apps, including third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> like Strava or Nike Run Club. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bi5VtC84xafVTsmEvAqTsH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-load-focus-2.jpeg" alt="The load focus screen on the Garmin Forerunner 965, showing high and low aerobic and anaerobic load data from the past month" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bi5VtC84xafVTsmEvAqTsH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Training load focus on the Forerunner 265 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving away from general downgrades to missing Garmin features, the Garmin Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t track training load or load focus. Technically, it <em>can</em> register post-run load, but you&apos;ll only see it in the Garmin Connect app if you own a pricier Forerunner like the 265 with training load data. </p><p>Training load matters because it helps me determine whether I&apos;m over- or undertraining compared to past weeks and which type of run (low aerobic, high aerobic, or anaerobic) I need to do next to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve my VO2 Max</a> over time. I wrote last month that this missing feature, purposefully excluded by Garmin, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-want-to-swap-my-garmin-forerunner-965-for-165-and-why-i-cant">reason why I can&apos;t replace my Forerunner 965 with the 165</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Without Training Load and Status, it's harder to confirm if you're improving or deteriorating as a runner. This data can be enlightening or discouraging, and while data-driven runners will miss this, others will want to avoid the distraction.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Other absent features include Training Status, which essentially summarizes whether your fitness is improving based on your Training Load, and the corresponding VO2 Max chart showing your changing score in recent weeks. You also lose Training Readiness, which goes beyond your Body Battery and estimated recovery time to judge your stamina level before a workout. Even if you&apos;re fully recovered from your last run, you still might not be "ready" due to stress, poor sleep, or other factors.</p><p>I could continue to list features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-performance-condition-needs-revamp">Performance Condition</a>, a lactate threshold test, multisport activities for triathletes, and others that only come with the Forerunner 265. In the end, you&apos;ll have to decide if you need all of these ancillary features, which would mean upgrading to the Forerunner 265. </p>

<p>As should be obvious from reading this review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">other Garmin Forerunner watches</a> are the best competition to the Forerunner 165. </p><p>The Forerunner 255 and 265 cost $100 and $200 more, respectively. The Forerunner 255 gives you Training Status and Load data, plus dual-band GPS tracking and an extra three days of battery life; in exchange, you have to accept an MIP display. The Forerunner 265 has the same features with Training Readiness added, plus a 13-day battery life. </p><p>If you want to look outside of Garmin watches, the COROS PACE 3 is the most obvious rival. It costs $20 less, with tools like training plan calendars, post-run training effect, and recovery time that the Forerunner 165 has. Plus, it has the training status and training load data that Garmin restricts, a 24-day battery life, and a similar weight and size. Negatives include its cheap appearance and dull MIP display, along with the fact that it lost to the Forerunner 165 in my accuracy test.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Garmin Forerunner 165 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're a runner who needs personalized workout recs and accurate post-run data.</li><li>You're using a last-gen Forerunner and want a hardware upgrade — but you're happy with the software.</li><li>You can't afford the pricier Forerunners.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Garmin Forerunner 165 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need Training Load data for your training schedule.</li><li>You'd rather prioritize battery life over an AMOLED display.</li></ul>
<p>Since I moved away from New York City and its many running clubs — right in time for a global pandemic — I&apos;ve become more of a solitary, data-driven runner. The Garmin Forerunner 165 checks most of my boxes, mainly with its workout suggestions that take my fatigue, training load, and upcoming races into account.</p><p>Because I tested the Forerunner 265 and 965 first, I&apos;ve become accustomed to seeing my training load data and VO2 Max graph for myself as a benchmark for whether I&apos;m staying on track. But if I&apos;d never used those watches, I wouldn&apos;t know what I was missing. I could simply download a Garmin marathon training plan to my calendar or use Garmin Coach and trust in my effort without needing an algorithm to prove my progress.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 will top my personal list of the best running watches of 2024, but I&apos;d only be able to use it if I took a different philosophical approach to my running. Whether <em>you</em> buy it will depend on the same thing: If you don&apos;t need Training Load, then don&apos;t upsell yourself to a pricier Garmin, and buy the excellent Forerunner 165.</p>

<ul><li>Google previously announced that Podcasts would shut down "after April 2," and the service started to shutter Thursday, April 4. </li><li>Both the Android app and web client for Google Podcasts shows a "Google Podcasts is no longer available" pop-up, but the website can still play podcasts for the time being. </li><li>YouTube Music will replace Google Podcasts in the Google ecosystem, and users have until July 30 to port their Podcasts data to another platform.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another fan-favorite Google app is shutting down for good, as Google Podcasts is no longer available in the U.S. Google primed users for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shutting-down">the discontinuation of Podcasts</a> for months, saying late last year that the service would be closed "after April 2." Now, as of Thursday, April 4, both the Podcasts app and web client are displaying messages that "Google Podcasts is no longer available."</p><p>The Google Podcasts app for Android doesn&apos;t work anymore and only offers users the option to export their podcasts or learn more about the shutdown in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/14151168" target="_blank">support document</a>. Though the website shows the same pop-up message, you can close the message and keep using Google Podcasts on the web client for the time being. It&apos;s only a matter of time before Google blocks access to Podcasts altogether, and we wouldn&apos;t count on the website working for much longer. </p><p>Google sees <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, the music streaming service that added support for podcasts last year, as the future of podcast distribution for the company. YouTube Music is trying to follow a similar model to Spotify, which hosts podcasts in addition to its main revenue source — music streaming. The general idea is that you&apos;re more likely to subscribe to one of these services if you can get all you need in one place, including music, podcasts, and even audiobooks. </p><p>The jury is still out on whether users actually prefer this because many have expressed their disappointment with the decision to kill off Google Podcasts. Having multiple media types in one place might sound like a good idea, but it also makes navigating an app like YouTube Music more difficult. </p>

<p>Google Podcast users have the chance to export their data to another service up until July 30, 2024. We have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-google-podcasts-migration-instructions">exporting Google Podcasts data to YouTube Music</a>, as well as one explaining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-migration-tool-available">how to migrate Google Podcasts data to a third-party service</a>. For what it&apos;s worth, people can listen to podcasts on YouTube Music without a subscription. However, the app is still less optimized for podcast distribution than Google Podcast was, lacking features like new episode notifications. </p><p>Google has an infamous reputation for killing off products and services early and often. After a nearly six-year run, Google Podcasts is now a part of that reputation.</p>

<ul><li>Google may be planning to add an attention-based screen lock setting to Android 15. </li><li>The feature is called Adaptive timeout, and it could shorten your device's screen timeout setting if it detects you aren't using your phone.</li><li>It seems like the reverse of Android's existing Screen attention feature, and appears similar to Apple's Attention awareness feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is set to bring a slew of new features and changes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and one subtle change might add a new option for screen timeout settings. Currently, you can pick the duration of time your phone will stay on before timing out and shutting off the display. Additionally, there&apos;s a <strong>Screen attention</strong> feature that will keep your display on longer if you&apos;re looking at it. Starting with Android 15, Google could add a feature that does the opposite. </p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> noticed strings related to a new <strong>Adaptive timeout </strong>feature in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-developer-preview-2-usb-security">second Android 15 Developer Preview</a>. The strings describe that the setting "automatically turns off your screen early if you’re not using your device" when enabled. Right now, it&apos;s unclear how Android will know when a phone is not being used, but it has to be more than a lack of touch input. As such, it probably uses the same sensing method as the existing Screen attention setting. </p><p>Rahman discovered the following strings in the settings app of Android 15 DP2, which hint at the new functionality:</p>
<ul><li><code><string name="contextual_timeout_description">Automatically turns off your screen early if you’re not using your device</string></code></li><li><code><string name="contextual_timeout_title">Adaptive timeout</string></code></li></ul>
<p>Notably, these strings are located under <strong>com.google.*</strong>, and according to Rahman, this means that the Adaptive timeout feature will likely launch as a Pixel exclusive. This tracks with how the Screen attention feature debuted alongside the Pixel 4, and has since expanded to other smartphones. </p><p>While there isn&apos;t a direct comparison available today to the possible Adaptive timeout feature Google is working on for Android 15, it sounds similar to a niche iOS feature. iPhones have a settings toggle for <strong>Attention Aware Features</strong>, which causes the phones to react differently when you are looking at them. These features use the TrueDepth sensor, which is also used for Face ID. However, in the case of Android 15, the Adaptive timeout setting will aim to do the reverse — changing how your phone behaves when you are <em>not</em><strong> </strong>looking at it. </p><p>Though we don&apos;t know a lot about Adaptive timeout right now, we expect to get a better look at the feature as Google continues to release Android 15 preview builds. </p>

The three-year-old brand clearly knows how to market its devices, and while its market share isn&apos;t on par with entrenched rivals, Nothing&apos;s devices get an outsized portion of the mind share.</p><p>A lot of that is down to Nothing&apos;s clever marketing, but the design-focused approach the brand takes to all of its products makes a big difference as well. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> highlighted this incredibly well, and the LED lights at the back, combined with the unique see-through aesthetic, made it an instant hit. Nothing followed it up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> last year, and it was catered to the high-end segment, delivering a more polished design and better hardware.</p><p>For 2024, Nothing is setting its sights on the budget segment. The Phone 2a shares a lot of the same great features that made its predecessors stand out — including a striking design and clean software — but it&apos;s the affordability that makes it an enticing choice. There&apos;s clearly no shortage of choice in the budget segment, but most phones still run middling hardware or outdated software with overt customization.</p><p>The Phone 2a is challenging those norms, and after using it for two weeks, it&apos;s clear to me that there&apos;s no reason to buy any other device in this category.</p>

<p>Nothing unveiled the Phone 2a on March 5, 2024, and the phone is now available in most global markets where the brand has a presence. It costs £319 in the U.K. for the 8GB/128GB version, and the 12GB/256GB model costs £349. The Phone 2a is available in other countries in Europe as well, where it costs €349 for the version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and €399 for the 12GB/256GB edition.</p><p>India is a big market for Nothing, and the 8GB/128GB version of the Phone 2a retails for ₹23,999, and the 12GB/256GB version costs ₹27,999. Nothing sells a unique 8GB/256GB version of the Phone 2a in India, and that particular variant is available for ₹25,999.</p><p>Nothing sells the Phone 2a in select countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and the one region where you can&apos;t buy the device in North America. Nothing has revealed why it isn&apos;t launching the Phone 2a in the U.S., and it has to do with the fact that the brand doesn&apos;t have a partnership with a carrier yet.</p>

<p>Nothing is best known for its design prowess, and the brand did a great job bringing its unique ethos to the budget segment. The end result is that the Phone 2a doesn&apos;t really look or feel like any other budget phone. It has a similar see-through design as the Phone 1 and Phone 2 but with a few tweaks.</p>

<p>As it doesn&apos;t come with wireless charging, the back has a different pattern that instead highlights the cable that connects the battery. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-co-founder-akis-evangelidis-phone-2a-interview">talked to Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis</a> about the design, and he mentioned that the inspiration for the back came from the New York City metro&apos;s subway maps. It looks distinctive, and the other area of differentiation is the camera housing that&apos;s now centered.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Picv9rwC5m3DWjbUfA7E7T" name="nothing-phone-2a-7.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Picv9rwC5m3DWjbUfA7E7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera housing sits in the middle of the NFC coil, and the positioning means there is no wobble when using the phone on a flat surface. The black version doesn&apos;t quite have the same presence as the white option, and the main issue I have with the design is that the back is a smudge magnet.</p>
<p>Nothing eschewed glass and went with a plastic back on the Phone 2a, and while that&apos;s fine, the glossy finish means the back is constantly covered in smudges. It also picks up dust easily, and I&apos;ve had to use a microfiber cloth on my desk because of the number of times I&apos;ve had to clean the phone over the last two weeks. The only other phone in recent years that got anywhere as dusty was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/redmi-k20-pro-review">Redmi K20</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MKEd27qpXVUmu5Fc4RxiFU" name="nothing-phone-2a-16.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MKEd27qpXVUmu5Fc4RxiFU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, I will mention that the Phone 2a has a great in-hand feel; the back has a slight curve where it meets the mid-frame, and the rounded edges make it highly comfortable to hold and use the phone. The matte sides go a long way in this regard, and they feel great — Nothing should have used a similar coating at the back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pVkuHiKhgMPVmGrhTKbdeT" name="nothing-phone-2a-11.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pVkuHiKhgMPVmGrhTKbdeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides are also made of plastic, but Nothing says the Phone 2a is using an aluminum mid-frame to increase structural rigidity. At 190g, the phone isn&apos;t particularly heavy and has good weight distribution. It has IP54 ingress protection, and while it doesn&apos;t withstand a dunk in the pool, it does a decent job of weathering the elements.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PQZ9ADUTFgRDqtaASdMTBW" name="nothing-phone-2a-23.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PQZ9ADUTFgRDqtaASdMTBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, a big part of the design has to do with the LED lights at the back, and while the Phone 2a doesn&apos;t have as many LEDs as the Phone 2, the Glyph lighting is just as fun to use. Now, I don&apos;t necessarily find the feature to be useful as I don&apos;t leave my phone face-down on a table, but the addition of a timer made it less gimmicky in my use case. The ability to see a visual indicator as the timer counts down is a great use of the LED lights at the back, and I actually ended up using it quite a bit.</p>
<p>On the whole, Nothing managed to stay true to its design heritage while still managing to deliver a phone that&apos;s fun to use. The Phone 2a is easily the best-looking budget phone around, and the unique styling combined with the attention to detail give it a distinct edge.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s6gnAw7NBeLhDQT2GcB6QU" name="nothing-phone-2a-17.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s6gnAw7NBeLhDQT2GcB6QU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing lavished a lot of attention up front as well, and the Phone 2a has a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel that goes up to 120Hz. While that&apos;s a standard feature in this segment, what makes the Phone 2a stand out is the symmetrical bezels on all sides — it adds to the upmarket look of the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="n5pu8tULSsjh55wXGuQcpU" name="nothing-phone-2a-19.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5pu8tULSsjh55wXGuQcpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s no LTPO tech, but you can choose between High and Standard modes, and the former ensures the refresh is locked to 120Hz most of the time. Colors are vibrant out of the box, and you can tweak the color warmth to your tastes. You get an always-on mode, but there isn&apos;t much in the way of customizability. That said, Nothing has a lot of custom widgets on the lock screen, and these make up for the lack of AOD options.</p>
<p>The Phone 2a does a good job with media, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues streaming HDR10+ content. Playing games is just as enjoyable, and the phone delivers excellent sustained performance. There&apos;s stereo sound on offer, and it gets loud enough that you don&apos;t need to use earbuds for casual gaming or streaming the occasional video.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PEBzYf4CEzyZ3e37Je9xhV" name="nothing-phone-2a-20.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PEBzYf4CEzyZ3e37Je9xhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another area where the Phone 2a has a strong showing is brightness figures. It goes up to 1,100 nits in outdoor use, and while that isn&apos;t as high as the Redmi Note 13 Pro, it is more than adequate — I had zero issues with the screen under harsh sunlight. Just like Xiaomi, Nothing offers PWM dimming, with the Phone 2a able to go up to 1920Hz.</p>
<p>The screen is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 5, and it has an optical fingerprint module. The only quibble about the sensor is that it is located a little too low on the screen, making it awkward to access.</p>

<p>Like the Nothing Phone 1 and Phone 2, the Nothing Phone 2a offers DC-like dimming at high brightness levels and 1,920Hz PWM dimming below that. 50% brightness and above uses a single-pulse dip that emulates DC-style dimming, but the Nothing Phone 2a has deeper modulation rates than the Nothing Phone 2 as evidenced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A5h7UynfnQ">in my comparison video</a>.</p>

<p>At 49% brightness and below, the phone switches to 1,920Hz PWM dimming with very low modulation rates. In fact, I found that 49% brightness was one of the most comfortable brightness levels on <em>any</em> modern OLED smartphone display. As you can see from the graph above, the graph is quite close to a flat line and, therefore, extremely comfortable even for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> folks.</p><p>At 49%, I found outdoor brightness to be comparable to some cheaper LCD panels. It&apos;s not super visible, but it&apos;ll work if you&apos;re super sensitive to low PWM rates and the DC-like dimming above, which bothers your eyes as well.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9wXPwMFPYoTuYhWerKs3GV" name="nothing-phone-2a-25.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wXPwMFPYoTuYhWerKs3GV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 2a has the distinction of being the first Nothing phone to feature MediaTek hardware. This isn&apos;t too surprising considering Qualcomm just doesn&apos;t have anything in the budget segment that is on par with MediaTek at the moment, and as a result, most budget phones now use the Dimensity 8300 or 7200.</p>
<p>In the case of the Phone 2a, Nothing is using a custom version of the Dimensity 7200, dubbed the Dimensity 7200 Pro. It uses the same set of cores: you get two Cortex A715 cores at 2.8GHz, and the efficiency side is handled by six Cortex A510 cores that go up to 2.0GHz. The phone has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with the base model, and I&apos;m using the 12GB/256GB variant.</p>

<p>While the Dimensity 7200 is a known quantity, Nothing definitely managed to make the most of the hardware, and the Phone 2a is optimized like no other budget phone I&apos;ve used to date. There is absolutely no lag whatsoever, and the level of fluidity immediately takes me back to the heyday of OxygenOS. The Phone 2a just doesn&apos;t feel like a budget device in this area, and that translates to gaming as well — it is able to deliver much better-sustained performance than any other budget phone.</p><p>Yes, there are issues if you play demanding titles at the highest settings, but turn down the visuals to medium, and you get smooth framerates without any jitter. While the device isn&apos;t able to run 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay test, the Wild Life Extreme stress test had a stability of 99.8%, and there was no overheating.</p><p>The synthetic workloads don&apos;t reveal the entire picture, but using the Phone 2a has been a revelation. If you&apos;ve been frustrated by budget phones that were laggy or otherwise unstable in daily use, you need to consider switching.</p>

<p>Rounding out the connectivity, there isn&apos;t a whole lot missing on the device; it has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and the requisite 5G bands. I didn&apos;t notice any issues with cellular connectivity or any of the other radios, and while the vibration motor isn&apos;t as detailed as what you get on high-end devices, it is better than most budget phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SW9GSk8nBo5fTQH7FGuA8U" name="nothing-phone-2a-13.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SW9GSk8nBo5fTQH7FGuA8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the battery, the Phone 2a has a 5,000mAh battery — the largest yet on a Nothing phone — and it easily lasts over a day with ease. Even with heavy use, I didn&apos;t feel the need to charge the device before turning it in for the night, and there&apos;s no reason to worry about battery longevity whatsoever.</p><p>The phone uses 45W charging tech, and a full charge takes a smidgen over an hour, hitting the 50% mark in 25 minutes. Obviously, a number of phones in this segment charge faster, but the Phone 2a isn&apos;t too far behind its rivals. What is annoying, though, is the lack of a charger in the box.</p><p>Nothing doesn&apos;t include a charger with any of its devices, but its earlier phones weren&apos;t aimed at the budget segment. Having to buy a charger to use with the phone is irksome, but as the device relies on the USB PD standard, any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-60w-usb-c-chargers">decent PD charger</a> is more than adequate.</p>

<p>The Phone 2a features a 50MP Samsung GN9 sensor with OIS, and it uses the same 50MP Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens as the Phone 2. The fact that you get two usable lenses at the back is a big deal; most budget phones only focus on the main camera, with the auxiliary lenses barely meriting any attention.</p><p>Like other devices in this segment, you miss out on 4K video at 60fps, and you don&apos;t get many extras in the way of shooting modes or custom filters. That said, the interface is easy to navigate, you get toggles for the two lenses — the phone uses the main camera to take shots at 2x zoom — flash, HDR, and effects.</p>

<p>Photos taken in daylight have plenty of detail, and Nothing continues to prioritize overly saturated colors, so you don&apos;t necessarily get accurate color rendition. That said, the resultant shots look pretty good, and they&apos;re great for sharing on social media. The wide-angle lens does a great job in daylight scenarios, and that&apos;s not astonishing considering the caliber of the hardware.</p><p>That said, you don&apos;t get as much detail; the tuning is too aggressive at times, and foliage, in particular, looks artificial. The phone redeems itself with its low-light prowess, delivering photos with minimal noise levels and plenty of detail. Night mode kicks in automatically once ambient light is under a certain threshold, and while the camera isn&apos;t quite on par with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, it is close.</p>

Nothing didn&apos;t mess with the overall aesthetic, so you get a clean UI that&apos;s similar to what&apos;s on the Pixels. Where Nothing differentiated the interface is by adding a ton of visual flourishes, and this is particularly noticeable with widgets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DjQUYwzyQSkFkMdUSYTC8V" name="nothing-phone-2a-21.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DjQUYwzyQSkFkMdUSYTC8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing has a set of custom widgets that are beautifully designed, and they liven up the interface quite a bit while providing contextual information. You also get monochrome icons that are terrific, but like all icon packs, there are a few missing apps, and the inconsistent styling is a bit weird. That said, Nothing did a better job than Google in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KuZRaXqhcvEaW2gWJPz9PV" name="nothing-phone-2a-27.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuZRaXqhcvEaW2gWJPz9PV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The notification shade has large tiles, and a double pull-down gesture surfaces eight in total, with the two at the top prominently highlighted. Pressing the Bluetooth tile pulls up the device menu without needing to go into the settings, and while this feature has been around for a while, it&apos;s still a welcome tweak.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UpW35DnowFXYTvHfS7gUXV" name="nothing-phone-2a-28.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpW35DnowFXYTvHfS7gUXV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of custom additions throughout the interface, and it&apos;s clear that Nothing put a lot of thought into which areas of the UI to address. The result is that the Phone 2a has the best software of any budget phone I&apos;ve used in a very long time. It&apos;s a rarity to get a clean interface in this segment, much less one that&apos;s brimming with exciting features. Best of all, there&apos;s no bloatware to be found. </p>

<p>On that note, Nothing is doing a fantastic job rolling out consistent updates to the phone. I&apos;ve had the phone for just over three weeks now, and it has already received two updates. Again, I can&apos;t think of another budget phone that has picked up as many updates.</p><p>Nothing guarantees three Android platform updates, and that means the Phone 2a will make the switch to Android 17 when that becomes available. To put things into context, the Redmi Note 13 Pro won&apos;t get any updates beyond <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p>

<p>Out of all the budget phones I used this year, the only one I&apos;d consider recommending is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">POCO X6 Pro</a>. I really like the design; the hardware is a smidgen more powerful than the Phone 2a, the battery charges faster, and the main camera is just as good. The software isn&apos;t as refined, and it won&apos;t get as many software updates, but other than that, the X6 Pro is a decent alternative.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-2a-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing Phone 2a: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KwkgSbf7wmNiP3SyUJb2fS" name="nothing-phone-2a-5.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwkgSbf7wmNiP3SyUJb2fS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best budget phone currently available</li><li>You need a phone that's great for gaming</li><li>You need good cameras at the back</li><li>You're looking for clean software that's customizable</li><li>You need a vibrant 120Hz OLED</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a charger bundled in the box</li><li>You live in the U.S.</li></ul>
<p>The best way to sum up the Phone 2a is that it doesn&apos;t feel like a budget phone. Nothing did a marvelous job optimizing the hardware, and the phone is just as fluid as the Phone 2 in daily use — no small feat. The design is evocative, the AMOLED panel is terrific, and the cameras take great photos in most situations.</p><p>However, the clear differentiator is the software; Nothing OS 2.5 offers the best software experience in the budget segment, and there isn&apos;t another device that comes close in this area. More than anything else, the clean software coupled with timely updates is what gives the Phone 2a a sizeable advantage over its rivals.</p><p>There&apos;s no shortage of budget phones with great hardware, but they all fall short when it comes to the software. That&apos;s why the Phone 2a is such a big deal; the software on offer is on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and you also get terrific hardware that delivers the performance you need.</p><p>There aren&apos;t any major drawbacks with the Phone 2a, and that in itself differentiates it considerably from the rest of the pack. There really is no reason to consider any other device in this segment.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new rumor suggests the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will likely feature a 4,400mAh battery and maintain a 25W charging speed.</li><li>Previous Samsung foldables, including the Z Fold 5, Z Fold 4, and Z Fold 3, have shared similar battery and charging specifications.</li><li>Despite battery concerns, potential upgrades for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 include a titanium frame, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy SoC, and an improved UTG panel for durability and touch sensitivity.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are due this year, and earlier leaks hinted at big improvements over last year&apos;s models. But it seems the battery and fast charging might remain unchanged for the upcoming Z Fold.</p><p>Ice Universe claims that Samsung is sticking with the same battery size for the Galaxy Z Fold 6, just like its predecessors. According to the tipster, the upcoming foldable will feature a 4,400mAh battery and maintain a charging speed of 25W. This information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-charging-speed-rumor">lines up with a certification listing in China</a>, so it seems pretty likely.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regarding the Galaxy Z Fold6 battery, it is still 4400mAh and has a charging power of 25w.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1775821691803115671">April 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Foldable smartphones have often faced challenges with battery life. Unlike some other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> brands that shove bigger batteries into their foldables, Samsung seems to have stuck with the same size for a while now.</p><p>Those exact same numbers can be found in previous Samsung foldables too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Z Fold 5</a>, Z Fold 4, and Z Fold 3 all share them. Meanwhile, the Z Fold 2 had a slightly larger 4,500mAh battery and the same 25W charging capacity.</p><p>For some, a 4,400mAh battery and 25W charging on a next-generation foldable phone like the Z Fold 6 is a bit of a letdown. Some people might have let the battery size slide, but who wants to wait forever to juice it back up?</p><p>On the bright side, the upcoming foldable could bring upgrades in other departments, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/grade-2-titanium-frame-for-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">including a titanium frame</a>, which is one of the anticipated improvements. The flagship foldable might also boast a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy SoC and 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Furthermore, whispers on the web suggest the Z Fold 6 might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-improved-ultra-thin-glass-and-thinner-design">sport a brand new UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) panel</a>. This supposedly means a smoother touch experience and a phone that can take a few more bumps and bruises.</p><p>Luckily, the wait to find out for sure isn&apos;t too long. Samsung is expected to unveil the Z Fold 6 in Paris this July. Then we&apos;ll know everything about the phone, battery blues and all.</p>

<p>Android 15 is slowly progressing, and it looks like Google has continued to iterate on a previously spotted "Private Spaces" feature.</p><p>As detailed by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-private-space-settings-3431105/">Android Authority</a>, Private Spaces has come a long way from its original discovery last year as Google has revamped its "setup flow." Things begin with its first page, which informs users that their Private Space cannot be transferred from one device to another. This is likely because Private Spaces is activated by creating a new Android profile specifically for the feature.</p><p>Additionally, Google has added a way for users to "lock" their Private Space automatically alongside an option to hide "sensitive information" on their lock screens.</p><p>Spotted in Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1, Google urges users to create a Google account to "keep their data private." Supposedly, this is because certain information/data about the user can leak out of the private space, such as their synced photos, files, emails, and more.</p><p>Moreover, your browsing history and saved passwords could be seen outside of the Private Space without a Google account.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rahman noticed the company added app download support for Private Spaces in the Pixel launcher. It looks like users utilizing the feature can download an app directly to their Private Space profile.</p><p>Rahman reiterates that users can decide to use their pre-existing lock screen password/PIN/etc. Users will also have the chance to create a new password for Private Spaces if they choose. However, using your fingerprint must be paired with a password, PIN, or pattern.</p>

<p>This new security and privacy feature was first spotted last December during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr2-beta-2">Android 14 QPR2 Beta 2</a>. The feature, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung&apos;s Secure Folder</a>, was said to let users create a separate, private space on their phones that would hide apps. The code  showed that apps tucked away "won&apos;t appear in permission manager, privacy dashboard, and other settings when Private Space is locked."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> started rolling out on Monday (Apr. 1), and with it came a ton of bug fixes for eligible devices. A few of the most important fixes involved solutions for the Pixel launcher&apos;s crashing woes, charging problems, glitches, and more. We&apos;re moving Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/overview">planned timeline</a> for Android 15&apos;s development as April marks the start of its beta for early adopters.</p><p>The major OS version isn&apos;t expected to launch until later this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new report claims that Samsung has a supplier in mind for its Galaxy S24 FE components amid other rumors about its potential launch window.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4789">The Elec</a> (Korean), which states Samsung has tapped Korean-based company Anapass as its supplier for a few S24 FE pieces (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-starting-to-build-the-galaxy-s24-fe-early-signs-show/">SamMobile</a>). It appears that the company will provide Samsung with the necessary display driver ICs for the S24 FE&apos;s OLED screen as production for it is set to begin.</p><p>The report adds that the upcoming FE phone will feature a "rigid OLED" display. The screen will adopt a chip-on-film packaging for its DDI, which is said to provide some visual changes. Placing the DDI on the film will provide "design freedom for the panel, and the bezels can also become thinner."</p><p>The publication alleges that Samsung is expected to manufacture "millions" of Galaxy S24 FE&apos;s this year.</p><p>Moreover, the company is supposedly eyeing a summer launch for the device.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a> launched late last year and was the return to the series after Samsung skipped out on the S22 FE. For context, the soon-to-be predecessor features a 6.4-inch display nestled in between the size of the Galaxy S23 and the S23 Plus. Rumors suggest a change in how the S24 FE&apos;s display is developed so that consumers may be in for a little more screen and less bezel this year.</p><p>Whether or not this <em>drastically </em>changes its display size in 2024 remains to be seen.</p><p>However, last year&apos;s model launched in October 2023, and this new report suggests we could see the S24 FE this summer. If the rumors are true, this gives us a window from June 20 to September 22 for an FE debut.</p><p>Other rumors about the S24 FE came early in March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-specs-leak">with leakers stating</a> it could offer near-flagship strength. The phone could feature the Exynos 2400 SoC or Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Curiously, these rumors speculate Samsung could go smaller with the device, opting for a 6.1-inch display instead.</p><p>It was added that the S24 FE may offer a slightly larger 4,500mAh battery over its predecessor&apos;s 4,000mAh capacity.</p>

Deciding what age your child should get a phone is entirely up to you, but when it&apos;s time, you want to ensure you&apos;re getting something worthwhile. As a parent or guardian, the most important features to look for include security, ease of use, and of course, budget.</p><p>Lucky for you, there are tons of great handsets that your kid and wallet will equally love. As you&apos;ll see on this list of choices, there are multiple ways to get a smartphone for your child. Some with custom software, others without, but all have the opportunity to be a great option for families.</p>

<p>Of all the kids&apos; phones available, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ive-tried-many-popular-kids-phones-and-this-one-is-the-best">Bark Phone is our favorite pick</a> because it offers a more balanced approach than other kids&apos; phones. It has just enough parental control features to keep your kids safe and give you peace of mind but also enough slack to let them naturally grow into the world they&apos;ll inevitably be thrust into.</p><p>The Bark Phone is basically a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> preloaded with the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/bark-premium-vs-bark-jr-which-app-is-best" target="_blank">Bark Jr software</a> which means it uses its own set of parental controls and isn&apos;t compatible with other parental control software. For some households that might already be using Google Family Link, this means either jumping through hoops to migrate your kids&apos; Google account off Family Link or creating a new Google account altogether.</p><p>But that means that Bark&apos;s software is allowed to take full control and, once you get to using it, you&apos;ll understand why it&apos;s a much, much better option. First off, Bark gives you as much or as little control as you want over your kids&apos; smartphone experience. You can vet every app they install, monitor social media and messaging, and even have Bark&apos;s built-in AI alert you of bullying.</p>

<p>The Bark Phone is a rebranded Samsung Galaxy A13 which is one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">favorite inexpensive Android phones</a> for many reasons. While it doesn&apos;t have enough power to properly play more graphics-intensive games, the OS is updated directly from Samsung and will get software and security updates for years to come.</p><p>That also means your child gets all the Samsung features that people love so they don&apos;t feel like they&apos;re getting some trashy hand-me-down phone. It&apos;s also got an impressive camera for the price range and battery life that&apos;ll last more than one day without issue.</p><p>The one big negative for me is the fact that the phone doesn&apos;t come with a built-in ad blocker. This isn&apos;t an issue for some other phones like Troomi, Gab, or Pinwheel because they have curated app stores, but the Bark Phone has full access to the Google Play Store. Your kid can&apos;t just install any app they like but there&apos;s a very high chance that, if they install a free app or game, they&apos;ll be inundated with ads that you may not like. Food for thought.</p>

<p>Pinwheel is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smaller-brands-are-outclassing-google-kids-tech-space">smaller companies</a> that&apos;s giving Google and other large brands a run for their money in the space of kids&apos; smartphones. Pinwheel offers recognizable phone brands like Samsung, and instead of using regular Android, these phones run a custom version of the OS to provide deeper parental controls.</p><p>Once you pick a phone from the Pinwheel website, you can decide if you want to bring your own carrier SIM or purchase one from them. The magic of Pinwheel is built into Pinwheel OS and the parental companion app. Overall the software looks much like what Android users are familiar with, but some of the features are disabled. But can be reenabled depending on what you, the parent, decide.</p>

<p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pinwheel-kids-smartphone-review">review</a> of the phone, I really enjoyed the flexibility offered by the phone&apos;s OS and the parental portal/app. Pinwheel has a solid set of parental controls that allow you to manage contacts, view communication, choose what apps can be installed, and more.</p><p>Those apps are all rated with descriptions of why Pinwheel scored them the way they did and are the <em>only</em> apps you can install on the phone. Kids can&apos;t just go to the Google Play Store and download an app or game which is both a blessing and a curse. It&apos;s great for parents who are worried about the never-ending ads and inappropriate content on many Play Store apps (especially free ones), but it&apos;s still a limitation that some may not like.</p><p>Pinwheel makes it easy for parents to track the phone&apos;s live location and where it&apos;s been. You can even create specific modes based on the time of day that will restrict access to specific functions and apps on the phone. These modes can also include tasks and reminders to help your child through their day. </p><p>If you want to use Google&apos;s Family Link with Pinwheel, technically, it is possible, but it isn&apos;t easy. I struggled to get some of the features to work with the locked-down version of Android. You also have to purchase the phone through Pinwheel, which is understandable since it runs a custom version of Android. All in all, Pinwheel OS is a great way to get your child started with a phone that can grow with them as they get older.</p>

<p>Buying a phone for your kid is a balancing act of getting something they&apos;ll want to use without spending a fortune. In our eyes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> best fits that bill.</p>
<p>The value proposition offered by the Pixel 7a is phenomenal due to some of the best cameras in any phone, solid battery life, and regular security updates. Plus, there&apos;s no breaking the bank to get both the phone and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-7a-cases">good case</a> to help it last even longer.</p>
<p>Arguably the most jaw-dropping aspect of the 7a is its camera. The 64MP rear camera takes downright gorgeous photos, matching picture quality with much more expensive phones. Photos get a bump thanks to Google&apos;s second-gen custom Tensor G2 processor. This also helps with faster on-device Google Assistant interactions. Even in low-light environments, the 7a&apos;s camera is a beast. So if you have a kid who&apos;s an aspiring photographer, you can&apos;t go wrong with the Pixel 7a.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the 7a is its software. It&apos;s currently running the latest available version of Android, and since it&apos;s a Pixel phone, it&apos;ll keep getting major OS updates and security patches through May 2028. You can rest assured that your kid&apos;s phone is always as safe as it can be and protected from new vulnerabilities that pop up. It will also work seamlessly with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Family Link</a>, Google&apos;s parental control app for your child&apos;s account.</p>
<p>The rest of the Pixel 7a experience is just as strong, thanks to its 6.1-inch AMOLED display, 8GB of RAM, and 4,385mAh battery. The 128GB of internal storage should offer plenty of room for all of your kid&apos;s apps/games, although microSD card support would have been nice.</p>

<p>Gabb Wireless is another one of the small companies working to make a big difference in connected kid devices. I&apos;ve had the opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gabb-phone-z2-review">review</a> this phone and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gabb-watch-review">Gabb Watch</a>, which, oddly enough, has better parental controls. But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself.  </p><p>The Gabb Phone is much like what Pinwheel does, where Gabb Wireless uses existing brands of devices and puts custom software on them. So, you&apos;ll not only need to purchase the phone from Gabb but also will need to use their phone service. But you can port over an existing number if you&apos;d like to. For parents interested in Gabb for an older child, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gabb-wireless-is-bringing-safe-tunes-and-new-devices-for-your-kids">Gabb Phone Plus</a>, as it&apos;s a more capable device with access to a few more features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nMqczVLakRx6W633AcwFWB" name="Gabb-Phone-Z2-Kids-Phone-lifestyle-07.jpg" alt="Gabb Phone Z2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMqczVLakRx6W633AcwFWB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software on the phone is very barebones, with only the most essential apps like phone, calculator, calendar, messaging, and such. From the parental portal, you can add Gabb Music which offers kid-appropriate music without the grown-up content. The portal also allows parents to see a live location of where the phone currently is.</p><p>A downside to the Gabb Phone is that the parental controls essentially stop there. You can&apos;t manage contacts or see who&apos;s been contacting your child. Gabb does off Gabb Guard, designed to block up to 95% of unwanted calls and texts but will run an additional $4.99/month. But for younger kids, the phone can be a great option as they are less likely to be adding many contacts other than family, and the stripped-down interface won&apos;t be distracting.</p>

<p>We fully understand if you&apos;re trying to keep costs as low as possible when buying a phone for your kid. Going too low can result in a lot of crap handsets to sift through, but one option that sticks out as a worthy contender is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Samsung Galaxy A15 5G</a>.</p><p>Before we even talk about price, the phone on its own is rock solid. Samsung doesn&apos;t put the Galaxy tag on just any phone. While the specs aren&apos;t going to push the top-of-the-line options, it runs a capable octa-core Mediatek Dimensity 6100+ processor, has 4GB of RAM, 128GB of expandable storage, and a very generous 5,000 mAh battery. Even though we&apos;d like to see more RAM to offer smoother performance, 4GB isn&apos;t bad, and that&apos;s to be expected when you&apos;re spending this little money.</p><p>On the front of the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is a 6.5-inch AMOLED display with a 13MP selfie camera. As for the back, the triple camera setup includes a 50MP primary sensor, a 5MP ultrawide camera, and a 2MP macro lens. While you don&apos;t get photos that are museum-worthy, they are more than good enough for your child. Plus, because this is a Samsung Galaxy phone, you get Android 14 out of the box along with four years of guaranteed software updates.</p>

<p>This pick isn&apos;t technically a phone but rather a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids&apos; smartwatch</a> that stays connected with a SIM card. So if you aren&apos;t <em>quite</em> ready to give your kid a fully-fledged smartphone but still want them to be within a phone call or text, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/angel-watch-series-r-kids-smartwatch-review">Angel Watch Series R</a> is what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>It&apos;s available in Blue, Pink, and Black colors and is easy for kids to put on their wrists. Plus, the secure strap stays there, even if your kid is a ninja and loves to climb everything. It&apos;s also IP67 water and dust-resistant so it&apos;ll survive everything from beaches to pools so long as your kids don&apos;t go diving too deep with it.</p><p>The Angel Watch parent app on your smartphone makes it easy to see your child&apos;s location right from the top of the app and it even makes it possible to remotely take readings of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and more.</p><p>This one doesn&apos;t feature an internet browser, copious amounts of games, or social media but it does feature important communication apps like WhatsApp and Line. In addition to that, the SIM card inside (plus Wi-Fi connectivity) makes it possible to text message and call anyone on the curated list of contacts that parents set. There&apos;s even an onboard camera so you can video call your kids (or vice versa).</p><p>Plus, parents can remotely monitor their kids via audio or video if an emergency situation comes up which grants substantial peace of mind. Plus, with the built-in spam protection, they won&apos;t get any random calls about their (nonexistent) car&apos;s extended warranty or other solicitous texts that might be unwanted.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out its April update for ChromeOS devices, which brings a few customization options for Chromebook users.</p><p>According to a Chromebook <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/267305152/introducing-chromeos-m123-to-the-stable-channel">community post</a>, Chromebook devices should begin receiving the latest ChromeOS M123 update in April. Customization features kick off this month&apos;s goodies, beginning with custom keyboard shortcuts. The post states that OS 123 lets users personalize their keyboard with "preferred key combinations."</p><p>Google adds that users can fine-tune their keyboards to fully function with one hand if necessary. Additionally, users can make their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> keyboard simpler to use or appear similar to another keyboard they&apos;re accustomed to through this new shortcut function.</p><p>Users won&apos;t find this functionality easily when updating. Google states users must enable it through a flag: <strong>#enable-shortcut-customization. </strong>Keyboard shortcuts will be enabled by default during ChromeOS M124.</p><p>Connected mice are receiving love as the company includes several mouse button customization options. The post states if a user&apos;s mouse has more than two buttons, they can now assign those to handle tasks like snapping screenshots, muting/unmuting, adding emojis, and more.</p><p>More importantly, users can take a shortcut from their keyboard and assign it to a mouse button for convenience.</p><p>ChromeOS will finally pick up Tether Hotspot in April, too. Users can begin sharing their Chromebook&apos;s cellular connection by hopping into their <strong>Network Settings > Hotspot toggle</strong>. For now, Google states it only supports devices with T-Mobile service in the U.S., but it will look to add more "in future releases."</p>

<p>This month&apos;s ChromeOS update comes with two additional updates: language preferences per app on Android and "natural-sounding" text-to-speech voices. The former can be altered by hopping into <strong>Settings > Apps > Manage apps > App language. </strong>The latter involves a few new voices added to the ChromeOS TTS, which are said to work in offline mode. The voices can be used in 31 languages, per Google.</p><p>Users should begin receiving the latest ChromeOS M123 update today and as we finish off the week.</p><p>The ChromeOS M122 update came during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromeos-update-allows-users-to-take-more-control-over-their-location">second half of March</a> and was focused on delivering more security and privacy for users.

<ul><li>Google has seemingly teased the launch date for its new "Find My Device" network as users have reportedly started receiving emails.</li><li>The company states it will begin rolling out its new network in "three days," placing us on Sunday (Apr. 7) or the more likely option Monday (Apr. 8).</li><li>Another report states that Google Play Service beta testers started receiving the new Find My Device settings, potentially doubling down on their upcoming launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Google is finally nearing the launch of its "Find My Device" network, which will let users find a slew of devices and bring more personal security.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/04/google-android-find-my-device-network-launch-date/">9to5Google</a>, the company started sending a wave of emails to users informing them about the impending launch of its Find My Device network. The email states the network will launch "in three days." Such a date would put us on Sunday (Apr. 7), but speculation sides with the more likely Monday (Apr. 8) timeframe.</p><p>Google also explained to users what they can expect from the new network, like being "able to locate your devices even if they’re offline." The email adds that any Fast Pair capable devices can be rediscovered while offline, including earbuds, headphones, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a> for your accessories.</p><p>Additionally, users were allowed to opt out of Google&apos;s upcoming device network. Doing so removes any of your devices from the network, leaving them available for rediscovery when they&apos;re online only.</p><p>The publication states there&apos;s a possibility that the email was sent "erroneously<br>
as rumors suggest Google will wait to activate its network alongside Apple. This could happen during the rollout of iOS 17.5 in May.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/03/android-find-my-device-network-live-early/">the publication spotted</a> Google&apos;s Find My Device network settings appearing for those who received the latest Play Services beta update. The page came with the following network options: off, "without network," "with network in high-traffic areas only," and "with network in all areas."</p>

<p>The settings back that Google Play Service beta testers have reportedly received look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-detail-spill">similar to a leak</a> last July. The leak highlighted information about a few of the options, such as "without network." Supposedly, that option would ditch the network but would "retain data about the device&apos;s last location when it was online."</p><p>Since July, we&apos;ve been waiting for Google to enable Android&apos;s new Find My Device network after it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">announced its delay</a>. The delay was on Apple&apos;s side as the company was still waiting to finalize the necessary measures for native tracker support. That&apos;s where this bigger narrative comes into play as Google and Apple teamed up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">tackle unwanted location tracking</a>.</p>
