Whether you want to check the brightness and color of your smart lights, start your robot vacuum, view the feed on your Nest cameras, or even easily connect new Matter smart home appliances, Google Home can do it all.</p><p>Google Home works on any Android or iOS device, although it sports the most features on Android devices because of the deep integration with Google&apos;s operating system. In fact, the Pixel Tablet will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">the best smart home control experience</a> thanks to its exclusive home control panel, designed to function similarly to a Nest Hub smart display.</p><p>The Google Home app even works on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, giving you quick smart home control right from your wrist. You could always use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to get things done, and many Google Assistant functions and settings are controllable via the Google Home app. Ready to learn more? Let&apos;s check it out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iTJYA57QLGzfs8PcHAxfQ4" name="google-home-app-devices-01.jpg" alt="Managing devices in the Google Home app in 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTJYA57QLGzfs8PcHAxfQ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Home app is free to download and use on Android&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app">Google Play Store</a> and the iOS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-home/id680819774">Apple App Store</a>. You will need a valid Google account in order to use it, though, so be sure to have that ready to sign into the app.</p><p>Controlling your smart home through Google Home is simple, but first, you&apos;ll need to set up the app and name your home. When you start the app for the first time, you&apos;ll want to enable notifications via the on-screen prompts. Once you select the Google account you want to use for the app, you&apos;ll be able to allow nearby devices permission and location access.</p><p>Nearby devices permission is optional but it gives the Google Home app the ability to scan for and add new nearby smart home devices, making setup just a button click or two. Gone are the days when you&apos;d need to download a dozen different apps for every smart gome product manufacturer!</p><p>Location access is also optional and, when enabled, will allow the Google Home app to automatically set your smart home devices to "home" or "away" modes, which can come in handy for automatically turning the lights on or off, setting the thermostat to eco mode, and enabling other power-saving automations.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve accepted all the permissions you&apos;re comfortable with, the Google Home app will ask you to name your home for organizational purposes. Each "home" within the app can have its own set of rooms or spaces, allowing you to conveniently organize smart home devices into the physical rooms they&apos;re in. That way, if you ask Google Assistant to "turn on the kitchen lights," Google Home will understand this command and only turn on the lights in the "kitchen" room within the app.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re starting from scratch or just got one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">best smart home devices</a>, you&apos;ll want to set it up in the Google Home app. The best part about Google Home is that it can incorporate nearly any smart home gadget you have, even if it&apos;s already set up in another app.</p><p>Better yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>-supported devices can be 100% set up in the Google Home app without needing to download the manufacturer&apos;s own app. In most cases, powering on a Matter-supported device for the first time will bring up a notification on your phone to set it up through the Google Home app. This is the easiest and quickest method with all newer smart home devices.</p><p>If you&apos;re running older smart home devices — or ones without Matter support — it&apos;s still pretty easy to set up in the Google Home app. Note that you may have to download the smart home device manufacturer&apos;s app first.</p>

<p>To add a new device, navigate to the <strong>devices</strong> tab at the bottom of the Google Home app, then tap the blue <strong>add button</strong> on the bottom right. From here, select the category of device that best fits the one you&apos;re trying to set up.

Most smart home devices are supported in Google Home, so all you&apos;ll need to do is follow the steps to log in to your account for that device&apos;s manufacturer and link it with your Google account.</p><p>Once you select a device category, choose your home and the room the device will be organized in.

<p>The Google Home app&apos;s main tab is the Favorites tab, which displays all your pinned smart home gadgets in a customizable grid. Items in this tab can be added or removed by scrolling to the bottom and tapping the <strong>edit</strong> button. Any item in the list that has a checkmark next to it will automatically appear in the Favorites tab.</p><p>Likewise, tapping the <strong>reorder</strong> button at the bottom of the favorites tab lets you move around each gadget&apos;s tile. I keep my most-used gadgets at the top of the list — my front door lock, living room lights, front yard camera, and thermostat — while other important, but less often used, gadgets are ordered further down the list.</p><p>Many Android phones support using this <strong>device control</strong> pane, as it&apos;s often called, right from the quick settings menu. To find this, pull down on the status at the top of your phone and find the device control button. On Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, this is often in the top row of quick settings buttons.</p><p>Some phones, like Samsung Galaxy phones, may require you to choose Google Home as your smart home control service first. Normally, this is done by opening the aforementioned device control panel, then tapping the <strong>overflow menu</strong> on the top right, followed by tapping edit or another similar option. Samsung often uses Samsung SmartThings as the default service, so you&apos;ll need to change this to Google Home in order to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.05%;"><img id="CjUmigxqVX26BMb4mXzs53" name="google-home-app-redesign-2023-pixel-tablet-hub-mode.jpg" alt="The new 2023 Google Home app on a Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjUmigxqVX26BMb4mXzs53.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1472" height="825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any light can be turned on or off by tapping the tile. You can also adjust the brightness of each light by sliding your finger left and right on the tile, so long as the light in question supports brightness adjustment. Long-pressing on a light tile will give you more options, like changing the color of supported lights.</p><p>Similarly, tapping the tile of a smart lock will lock or unlock it, while smart plugs will turn on and off when tapped. Long-pressing any tile will give you more options for that gadget. Some tiles, like camera feeds, may even display advanced timeline and event options if supported.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-security-cameras">best wireless smart home security cameras</a>, like Nest Cam (battery), have the option to quickly turn the camera on and off right on the video tile. A tap on the tile itself will bring up the camera UI which shows the last handful of recorded events and may even display PTZ controls on supported cameras.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to control all your devices — or just one that&apos;s not on the favorites tab — tap that devices tab at the bottom to see all your smart home devices organized by room. The same control UI from the favorites tab applies here, so tapping on a tile will perform a quick on/off action, sliding on lights will adjust brightness, and long-pressing will bring up more options for that device.</p>

<p>Google has substantially overhauled the automations function in recent years, providing an easy way for your smart home devices to control themselves. Whether that means turning lights on and off with a timer, changing your thermostat when you leave home, or locking the door at bedtime is all up to you.</p><p>One of the coolest functions of the Google Home app is the quick home and away modes function, which lets you group common actions together based on whether you&apos;re at home or away from home.</p><p>To get started with this, navigate to the <strong>automations</strong> tab, then tap either <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Away</strong> to start setting up devices for location-based automation. Google offers suggested starters in each category which will help you quickly decide what options make the most sense. For instance, turning off your indoor cameras, setting the thermostat to a comfortable level, and playing music could all occur when you pull into your driveway.</p><p>Likewise, you may want to enable camera recording, turn on the porch light, and set the thermostat to eco mode when you leave the house. Once you&apos;re done selecting your desired actions, tap the blue <strong>save button</strong> on the bottom right to save either the Home or Away function actions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ncLYM4JiccDc7rKBGHDrEF" name="google-home-app-redesign-2023-dark-Pixel-7a.jpg" alt="The new Google Home app 2023 redesign in dark mode on a Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncLYM4JiccDc7rKBGHDrEF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in the main automations tab, tapping that blue <strong>add button</strong> will let you configure other automations that can occur based on the time of day, if you want to give Google Assistant a specific command, or even by using other smart home devices as a trigger. For instance, ringing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells">favorite video doorbell</a> can trigger anything from lights turning on, video recording, or even music playing to greet the person at your door.</p><p>Some devices, like lights, are nice to turn on and off based on sunrise or sunset. Tapping that <strong>add button</strong>, and then selecting <strong>sunrise or sunset</strong> as the starter action will enable this.</p><p>Otherwise, maybe you&apos;d prefer to start a routine when you go to bed or when it&apos;s time for your kids to take a bath. Selecting <strong>when I say to Google Assistant</strong> as the starter action lets you use any custom command to start a routine, so "bed time" or "bath time" can trigger any number of devices in your home to do something you want to encourage better sleep or quicker bedtime routines.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google made waves when it announced that the Pixel 8 series of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> would support seven years of full OS upgrades last year. Samsung followed up Google’s commitment with a matching seven-year update promise of its own for the Galaxy S24 series earlier this year. More recently, Google extended that seven-year promise to cover the midrange <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, proving that great software support can be had on devices at any price point.</p><p>Of course, these commitments were viewed as a massive win for Android — even if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">we aren’t quite sure what Android will look like in 2031</a>. However, we still don’t have a finite gauge of how Google and Samsung’s software commitments stacked up against Apple’s. Until this year, Apple was the clear industry leader in software support with the iPhone and iOS. The uncertainty was cleared up this week, as Apple officially declared how long it would support the iPhone 15 series in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://regulatoryinfo.apple.com/cwt/api/ext/file?fileId=securityTelecommunication%2FiPhone%2015%20Pro%20Max%20%28Model%20A3106%29_V0.pdf" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-software-support-commitment-3449135/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Apple never publicly stated the software support for iPhones before, making evaluating them tricky. The first two iPhones supported three years of iOS updates, while a few later iPhones supported as many as seven iOS upgrades. That’s a big range that leaves a lot up to Apple’s discretion. However, thanks to the United Kingdom’s new Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure policy, companies now have to disclose a guaranteed software support window for certain products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wNnxn8REnMfcQuoSUX4mHg" name="oneplus-12-vs-iphone-15-pro-max-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNnxn8REnMfcQuoSUX4mHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In accordance with this new regulation, Apple said that the iPhone 15 series would get a total of five years of software support from the date the phones were first released. For those not keeping track, that’s five years from Sept. 22, 2023. Notably, that means Google and Samsung have guaranteed two more years of software support than Apple, and this is a first. </p><p>Software support matters, regardless of whether you will actually use your new Pixel 8 Pro or Galaxy S24 Ultra for seven years or not. Of course, with software support, you theoretically could do so. If, like most people, you decide to upgrade earlier, you can trade in or sell your old smartphone. Devices currently receiving software updates will fetch more on the resale market than unsupported ones, so phones with longer software support windows will retain their value better. Additionally, if phones can be used for longer, we can reduce E-waste and produce fewer new devices.</p><p>It’s something that should factor into your purchase decision. And for the first time, Android is the one receiving a tick in the win column.</p>

<p>Like many of Apple’s recent moves, the company has only decided to outline a software support promise for the iPhone 15 series to comply with regulations. The five-year window is the minimum, and Apple could always extend support beyond this initial guarantee. There is evidence to suggest that the company will support more than that, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/" target="_blank">Statista’s</a> tracking of iPhones and iOS updates. </p><p>The last iPhone to support just five iOS versions was the iPhone 6, released in 2014. All the iPhones released since have received either six or seven iOS versions, though the jury is still out on some of the newer models. It’s possible that Apple is anticipating on-device AI processing becoming a huge part of iOS, which would restrict what kinds of hardware can run newer iOS versions. Or, in the more likely scenario, Apple is just declaring a minimum number, and it plans to offer more support than it has agreed to. </p>

<p>Still, we shouldn’t give Apple a pass just because it <em>could</em> offer more support to the iPhone 15. As it stands now, the newest Android phones are guaranteed to get more full OS upgrades than the newest iPhones. That’s true regardless of how these promises and support windows end up playing out. Android manufacturers, specifically Samsung and Google, deserve credit for solving what was a major problem for the platform in previous years. </p><p>It was a common notion that iPhones inherently lasted longer than Android phones, and this situation has been completely flipped. At present, Pixel and Galaxy devices are guaranteed to receive more software support than iPhones, helping them last longer. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-no-longer-fix-samsung-phones-at-best-buy">Samsung has some serious repairability problems</a> that could limit how long Galaxy phones can feasibly last, but Google is doing great on that front. Combined, it’s definitely possible that a Pixel phone can last longer than a new iPhone with great hardware and software support.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing to remember when we discuss the software support windows promised by companies — they actually have to deliver on these promises. The work isn’t done yet; in fact, the opposite is true. If the version of Android released seven years from now runs like garbage on Pixel 8 series phones, this support promise will be seen as nothing more than a marketing tactic. Other Android Central staffers and I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-8-8a-receiving-gemini-nano-soon-should-make-you-skeptical-about-update-promise">expressed skepticism over the Pixel 8 update guarantee</a>, and we aren’t the only ones. </p><p>Samsung and Google still have to prove that they can support phones for seven years. But for now, it’s worth giving a tip of the cap to Android brands that have managed to usurp Apple in software support for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The global OPPO Reno 12 Pro could have 12GB of RAM and run on Android 14, compared to the Chinese version's 16GB of RAM.</li><li>It will reportedly feature a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor instead of the Chinese model's Dimensity 9200+.</li><li>The camera setup remains strong with a 50MP main camera, 50MP telephoto lens, and 8MP ultra-wide, plus a 50MP front camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OPPO&apos;s Reno 12 and 12 Pro made their debut in China last month, but these mid-range champions are hitting shelves worldwide soon, apparently with a few tweaks under the hood.</p><p>Before hitting the international market, the OPPO Reno 12 Pro 5G popped up on a Geekbench listing spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/oppo-reno-12-pro-geekbench-listing/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a>. The listing shows the global version will come with 12GB of RAM and run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Interestingly, the Chinese version of the Reno 12 Pro has a heftier 16GB of RAM. So, it looks like the global release will have just one base storage option.</p><p>Interestingly, the listing indicates a slight change in the chipset for the global version compared to the Chinese model. Though it&apos;s not confirmed, the Geekbench listing suggests the global Reno 12 Pro will feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor</a>. This guess comes from seeing four performance cores running at 2.50GHz and four efficiency cores at 2.0GHz.</p><p>So, it looks like the global version of the Reno 12 Pro is dialing down the processing power compared to the Chinese model. The Chinese version sports the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ chipset, while the global one seems to settle for the MediaTek Dimensity 7300. This might be a trade-off to cut costs.</p><p>Even though the global Reno 12 Pro will presumably have a more modest processor, there are some positives in the camera department. It&apos;s expected to keep the impressive triple-camera setup from the Chinese version. This means you&apos;ll get a powerful 50MP main camera with a Sony IMX890 sensor, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera. Plus, the global version should also have the same 50MP front camera, ensuring great selfies and video calls.</p><p>Despite the processor change, the global Reno 12 Pro also seems ready for heavy use with its rumored 4,880mAh battery. Plus, with 80W fast charging, you&apos;ll get quick power-ups.</p><p>The global version appears to keep a major strength from its Chinese counterpart: the display. Both the Pro and standard models are expected to feature a spacious 6.7-inch OLED display with FullHD+ resolution and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Though exact pricing for different regions isn&apos;t known yet, the competitive pricing in China suggests that the global Reno 12 lineup will also target the mid-range market. This makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious users looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">feature-packed smartphone</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing&apos;s sub-brand is brewing a budget phone, the CMF Phone 1, with new rumors of a surprise Dimensity 7300 chipset.</p><p>Last week, CMF <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1798640847824822400" target="_blank">unveiled the CMF Phone 1</a>, a fresh face in the smartphone scene. It stands out with a unique design featuring a mysterious knob on the back. This quirky addition has tech fans buzzing, guessing what it might do.</p><p>Initially, rumors had the CMF Phone 1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-cmf-phone-1-might-have-a-little-surprise-in-store">sporting a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 processor</a>. But a recent leak from leaker @gadget_bits on X (formerly Twitter) hints at an upgrade to the new Dimensity 7300 SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/cmf-phone-1-chipset-key-specs-concept-image-tipped/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CONFIRMED]: The CMF Phone 1 is equipped with the newly launched MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor.

<p>Interestingly, this chip isn&apos;t a direct follow-up to the Dimensity 7200 but builds on the Dimensity 7050. Performance-wise, it’s expected to match the Snapdragon 778G+ found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone 1</a>.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that @gadget_bits&apos; leak hasn&apos;t been verified. The source hasn&apos;t built a reputation for reliable leaks, so take this detail with a grain of salt.</p><p>In May, MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">introduced the Dimensity 7300 series</a>, calling them "ultra-efficient 4nm chips" built for top-notch mobile performance. These chipsets aim to deliver smooth multitasking, advanced AI processing, faster gaming, and better mobile photography.</p><p>The upcoming OPPO Reno 12 Pro is set to feature the Dimensity 7300. Geekbench 6 benchmarks show a single-core score of 1,043 and a multi-core score of 2,944, putting it in the same league as the Nothing Phone 1. So, if the CMF Phone 1 has the same chipset, you can expect similar performance.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 will be the first phone release from Nothing&apos;s new sub-brand. Building on the success of its parent company in the competitive smartphone market, CMF is set to make a strong entry with this debut device.</p><p>Since it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-could-be-way-cheaper-than-nothings-budget-phones">expected to be a budget device</a>, the CMF Phone 1 won&apos;t be going head-to-head with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a>. This smart move could help it shake up the lower price segment, where a new contender might have a better chance than in the crowded high-end market.</p><p>Moreover, the phone stands out with its unique design aesthetic, sure to grab attention when it launches. However, how this unconventional design will hold up in everyday use is still uncertain.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is rolling out a user-friendly redesign of Fire TV ads, making them less intrusive for viewers.</p><p>In late 2023, Amazon made a bold move by changing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-2023-review">Fire TV</a> user interface. Instead of the usual navigation menu as the starting point, the platform introduced a big banner ad that takes up a lot of the home screen. Just hovering over this banner would trigger an autoplay video ad, hitting users with unsolicited content right from the start. This change really threw off the familiar user experience and left a lot of people unhappy.</p><p>Even though there was an option to disable autoplay ads, the default setting was still disruptive and intrusive. This update forced users to watch unsolicited video ads right when they started up their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">beloved Fire TV devices</a>, even before they had a chance to engage with the platform.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/amazon-is-making-its-full-screen-video-ads-on-fire-tvs-less-annoying/" target="_blank">CordCuttersNews</a> reveals that a redesign on the Fire TV platform has significantly reduced the disruption caused by these ads. The change moves promotional content to a dedicated mini-player, taking up much less space on the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XXXfBA8kN6RS2BvnNwWnDK" name="amazon-fire-tv-ads.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV pop-up ad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXXfBA8kN6RS2BvnNwWnDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CordCuttersNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the mini-player only shows a limited view of apps, the interface is still accessible, now positioned at the bottom of the screen. This redesign is expected to roll out to all Fire TV devices released since 2016.</p><p>Additionally, the automatic playback is gone. Now, users will encounter a brief delay before any promotional content appears, reducing the immediate disruption that many found annoying.</p><p>Basically, with the new Fire TV interface, you can start using apps or browsing before any ads start playing. This is different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, where video ads automatically start when you reach the featured content section.</p><p>The revamped Fire TV interface also lets users skip ads easily with a press of the home button or by setting up a shortcut on their controller.</p><p>Of course, pop-up video ads are common on smart TV platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a>, but there&apos;s a key difference. Usually, ads only play when users interact, like hovering over them. However, the previous setup on Fire TV automatically launched video ads without any user input, making it a lot more disruptive, until now.</p>

<hr>
<p>Humane has instructed owners of its $700 AI Pin device to "immediately" cease using its charging case due to a potential fire hazard.</p><p>After looking into a report about a charging problem, Humane found a battery quality issue in the AI Pin&apos;s Charge Case Accessory, which was supplied by a third-party vendor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172377/humane-ai-pin-battery-case-issue-warning" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reports.</p><p>Although Humane didn&apos;t confirm if the charging issue caused an actual fire, the company did find that some battery cells from this vendor could be a fire hazard.</p><p>On the other hand, the AI Pin itself, along with its battery booster and charging pad, are safe; the problem is only with the charging case parts.</p><p>“Our investigation determined that the battery supplier was no longer meeting our quality standards and that there is a potential that certain battery cells supplied by this vendor may pose a fire safety risk,” Humane wrote in an email to customers, which was published on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/27328584972557-Stop-Use-Notice-for-Charge-Case-Accessory" target="_blank">support website</a>. “As a result, we immediately disqualified this battery vendor while we work to identify a new vendor to avoid such issues and maintain our high quality standards.”</p><p>"While we know this may cause an inconvenience to you, customer safety is our priority at Humane," the company wrote.</p><p>To make up for it, Humane is offering two free months of its subscription service, which is needed for most of the AI Pin’s features. The company hasn&apos;t said yet if it will replace the faulty charging cases.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Humane for more information on its plans to replace the charging cases and will update this article when we get a response.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">AI Pin’s launch has been rocky</a>, with harsh reviews pointing out many issues with its basic features like on-palm projection and gesture controls. There are also reports that Humane <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">might be looking to sell the company</a> just weeks after launching the AI Pin, adding to the device’s troubled start.</p>

<p>WWDC 2024 starts tomorrow, June 10, and iPhones are about to get inundated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/apple/the-name-of-apples-ai-overhaul-just-leaked-and-its-so-obvious-you-probably-could-have-guessed">Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?)</a>, according to a major leak. Given Google and Samsung&apos;s pivot to AI, it&apos;s an unsurprising shift for the brand. Personally, I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">less interested in the industry&apos;s AI shift</a> and more intrigued by what Apple Intelligence could mean for Apple Fitness.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/apple-wwdc-2024-what-to-expect-ai-ipados-18-macos-15-siri-updates-more?sref=HrWXCALa" target="_blank">Bloomberg&apos;s Mark Gurman</a>, who leaked the laundry list of AI features coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/apple/wwdc-2024-expected-date-new-software-hardware-and-more">WWDC 2024</a>, promises that Apple will announce "major" changes to the Fitness app, along with Health changes like "improved blood pressure data management" and "cycle tracking."</p><p>He doesn&apos;t specify what major AI changes Fitness will receive, but I&apos;m looking at Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-ai-health-and-fitness-insights">recent Galaxy AI fitness announcement</a> for clues. The South Korean company promised a daily Energy Score, AI Wellness Tips for losing weight and other life goals, and personalized workout routines to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p><p>Why bring this up? Because I suddenly find Samsung&apos;s timing suspicious. Why reveal this in May when the new Galaxy Watch won&apos;t ship until August? Maybe Samsung guessed that Apple would announce similar AI fitness tricks at WWDC 2024 and wanted to be the "first" to reveal them.</p>

<p><em>My</em> guess is that Apple Fitness will add its own "daily readiness" score, following in the footsteps of Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, and other brands. It has all the data necessary, from sleep stages and resting HR to stress and activity tracking. It simply needs a sufficient algorithm to interpret that data properly.</p><p>Apple Fitness Plus already offers some of the best guided at-home workouts, but it&apos;s possible Siri could start pointing you to specific routines based on your fitness level, muscle map, and tiredness. Perhaps it could tell you whether you have the strength to complete a second routine, based on your heart rate data during the first routine.</p><p>My personal hope is that Apple Intelligence will be able to suggest daily running or cycling workouts by time, length, and pace, based on your VO2 Max — just as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can. For instance, it could recommend a harder pace when you&apos;re well-rested, then a light jog the following day.</p><p>Or, Apple could take more of a Fitbit-esque approach, recommending you hit a certain amount of Active Zone Minutes per day based on your energy level. Apple could make its daily rings more dynamic, adjusting your movement and stand goals as necessary so you&apos;re improving but not overtraining. </p>

<p>Apple probably intends to make its AI a fitness coach, just as Samsung does. And it&apos;s an exciting development! I&apos;ve been waiting for more mainstream smartwatches to try their hands at coaching. The question will be whether either brand can pull it off and give proper advice to both couch-to-5Kers and proper athletes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> is the rare mainstream watch to have coaching, thanks to Google&apos;s Fitbit acquisition, but the most recent Fitbit updates have focused on new health sensors. We haven&apos;t seen many updates to Fitbit&apos;s <em>coaching</em> in years. The Galaxy Watch 7 and Apple Watch X entering the fray would challenge Google to innovate, and give consumers more options for at-home coaching.</p><p>Or perhaps I&apos;m misreading what "major" Apple Fitness changes are coming, and we won&apos;t get <em>any</em> Apple Intelligence updates. We&apos;ll find out at WWDC 2024 tomorrow if Apple is evolving or falling behind the pack.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor floating around says Samsung might let you check the time on your Galaxy phone with just a double tap, even when the screen is off.</p><p>As spotted by tipster Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter), Samsung is developing an update for the RegiStar module in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app, which will supposedly introduce a new feature that allows you to tap the back of your phone twice to check the time (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/06/samsung-android-15-double-tap-time-good-lock/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This new functionality is said to debut on the next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Flip 6.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Exclusive: Double Tap to Check Time (Even with Screen Off!)‼️The first feature for One UI 7 & One UI 6.1.1 is GoodLock RegiStar's "Check Time with Back Tap" - coming soon to your Galaxy phone!Repost 👯‍♀️👬https://t.co/CMHyQQBw5D#GalaxyS24 #OneUI #Samsung #OneUI7<a href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1798651936524394681">June 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Launched with Android 13-based One UI 5</a>, the RegiStar module lets Galaxy phone users customize their interface. With RegiStar, you can change what happens when you long-press the side key and set actions like taking a screenshot with a double-tap on the back of the device.</p><p>Currently, the Back-Tap function requires the phone&apos;s display to be on. However, with the upcoming One UI 6.1.1 update, Samsung plans to change that. The new update will add a feature allowing Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 users to check the time by double-tapping the back of their device, even when the screen is turned off.</p><p>This feature might be expanded to more Galaxy devices in the future. This broader rollout is expected to happen with the release of One UI 7, which is likely to be Samsung&apos;s version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>This feature seemingly aims to take the Back-Tap option in RegiStar to the next level. It may sound perfect for situations where the display is hard to see, such as in bright sunlight.</p><p>But since many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">favorite Galaxy devices</a> already have an always-on display and other options to check the time with a simple tap or by raising the device, the new double-tap-to-check-time feature raises questions about its practical utility. It&apos;s unclear if this new method will significantly enhance the user experience or address a specific, yet unidentified, user need.</p><p>While the usefulness of the upcoming feature might be up for debate, it&apos;s still a cool upgrade for the RegiStar module. It lets you do more without needing the screen on. Samsung will probably keep other Back Tap actions disabled when the screen is off to avoid accidental triggers.</p>

The timeline, originally named "location history," is a feature that lets you keep track of the places you&apos;ve visited and the routes traveled. </p><p>In December 2023, Google changed where the location history was being stored. Users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default) will see Google Maps&apos; Timeline saved directly on their device rather than the web, giving them even more control over their data. </p><p>This means that if you access Google Maps on the web, the Timeline will not show any history of the places you&apos;ve visited. Instead, the company is pushing users to download the app and continue accessing the feature. </p><p>Users have until December 1, 2024, to shift from the web version to the app. Otherwise, all the saved data will be lost. However, the company says it will try moving up to 90 days of Timeline data to the "first-signed- device" after the deadline. Any routes or visits made before that period will be auto-deleted.</p>

As a result of the change, Spotify Premium will cost more than other competing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Apple Music and Tidal. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2024-06-03/adjusting-spotify-premium-prices-in-the-us/" target="_blank">press release</a>, as well as in an email to subscribers, Spotify justified the price increase by saying it would allow it to "invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices."</p><p>"Over the next month, subscribers in the U.S. will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscription."</p><p>The price for a Premium Individual plan is now $11.99, a dollar more than the old rate. Spotify Premium Duo is up by $2 and costs $16.99—the old price of the Spotify Premium Family plan. Premium Family will now cost $19.99, a $3 increase. The updated prices are being rolled out nearly a year after Spotify&apos;s last price hike, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-to-bump-up-its-premium-pricing">which was in July 2023</a>. </p><p>Additionally, a discovery in Google&apos;s app suggests that the company is working on a Spotify extension for Gemini. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-extension-potential-code-strings-discovered">spotted</a> in version <strong>15.22.2</strong> of the Google app, a Spotify extension for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> might be coming. The availability of a Spotify extension would (ideally) let users quickly access their created playlists and discover songs, genres, artists, and more. Gemini will alert users with a string that reads, "starting to play on Spotify." This looks like a message users see after telling the AI to play a certain song or playlist.</p>

The policy, effective since July 19 of last year, grants Google the right to retain Pixel devices sent in for repair if unauthorized components are discovered.</p><p>The specific clause, as found on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-14530025?sid=ac-ca-1235900637360103068&url=https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">website</a>, states: "You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you."</p><p>This policy creates a conflict between your right to fix your own phone and Google&apos;s desire to keep things under its control. Google&apos;s repair policy extends to any accessories, like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-cases">favorite Pixel 8 cases</a>, which will likely be relegated to the lost and found bin, assuming your phone even passes the "authorized parts" inspection.</p><p>However, following significant backlash from customers, the company says it will not retain phones for repair due to non-OEM parts.</p><p>"If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether the phone has non-OEM parts or not," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. "In certain situations, we won&apos;t be able to complete a repair if there are safety concerns. In that case, we will either send the phone back to the customer or work with them to determine next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this."</p>

Beyond its powerful suite of cameras, the Pixel 8 Pro boasts quick, smooth performance due to the capable Google Tensor G3 chipset, useful AI features, and a long-term software support promise to assure buyers it&apos;ll keep getting better.

<p>The awesome <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> is on sale at Best Buy right now, ringing in at $250 less than the normal price when you buy unlocked. Most of all, we love this phone for its powerful cameras, but there's honestly a lot to appreciate when it comes to this premium Google phone. While it's normally pretty pricey, this deal slashes 25% off the price, so you can get more for less.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you take a lot of photos and/or videos and want a powerful camera; having a phone with a long-lasting battery is a major priority for you; you want a phone with a long-term software update promise.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d rather get an even cheaper phone and would be better suited with a budget-friendly option; you just want the best gaming phone available and are willing to pay a higher price.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phone</a> for parents, but pretty much anyone who appreciates a high-quality suite of cameras and strong performance will like this premium smartphone. It also has an excellent 6.7-inch AMOLED display that&apos;s easy on the eyes, a long-lasting battery, and seven years of Android updates—making it a model you know will improve over time.</p><p>Even with smooth performance across most of the phone&apos;s applications, gaming isn&apos;t a strong suit for the Pixel 8 Pro. Still, most casual gamers will get what they need out of it, especially with the camera offerings that make this phone so worthwhile.</p><p>There are still cheaper phones out there to be sure, even with this discount. However, if you were already in the market for a premium phone, than an extra $250 off might not hurt, especially spent on a phone this powerful.</p>
