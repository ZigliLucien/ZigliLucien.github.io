<p>I'm not comfortable reviewing my Garmin Fenix 8 yet. It's Garmin's most densely packed watch yet, with enough features that it'll take me a couple more weeks to give them justice. But after years testing $400-ish Garmin watches and waiting years for my first Fenix, the Fenix 8 hasn't fully lived up to my sky-high expectations.</p><p>I received and unboxed my Garmin Fenix 8 later than most, still getting my bearings while Fenix 8 owners noticed it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/385888/cold-water-crash">crashing in cold water</a> or showing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/382071/nap-glance-showing-hundreds-of-thousands-of-hours-of-naps">thousand-hour naps</a> (or naps when they weren't napping). Annoyed Garmin forum users spotted a bevy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/382626/fenix-8-list-of-software-issues">other software issues</a>, some niche but others widespread.</p>

<p>By October, the Fenix 8 had received some useful patches, but I still encountered problems like input lag when navigating the main UI. When I tried to end a two-mile walk activity, the watch froze on the "Saving" screen for hours and refused to factory reset until I plugged it into my computer. Then, the battery drained at an insane rate (about 85% in under two days) until I charged and restarted it.</p><p>Things have calmed down for me since then, both for battery life and general navigation. But it still seems evident that Garmin must have been on a time crunch to release the Fenix 8 on schedule — possibly shareholder-related considerations — given the number of Fenix 8 glitches that went unresolved until after launch. And that's not a great look when you're charging more money than any other fitness watch brand <em>and</em> much more than the Fenix 7 series (which started at $799).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NbSHsnAzJWRHg2hNnZfHMQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-run-new-UI" alt="Starting a new track run activity on the Garmin Fenix 8.

<p>I'll point out now that I <em>like</em> the Fenix 8 thus far. For starters, the revamped UI improves on what I saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> last year, particularly seeing suggested workouts and courses directly under the activity start menu. I appreciate the AMOLED/MIP options so you can prioritize battery life or better visual quality. And despite the plastic-to-titanium swap, my 47mm unit doesn't feel overly heavy at 73g.</p><p>In terms of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3#section-garmin-fenix-8">new features</a>, the Fenix 8 added strength coaching to Garmin Coach about six months after I wrote a piece demanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">Garmin make indoor workouts better</a> with tailored suggestions. As a runner, I'm still easing into strength training, but it's already a step over what most fitness watches offer for reps and beginner guidance.</p><p>You also get a microphone and speaker connected to an offline voice assistant, which is no longer restricted to passthrough commands to your smartphone. You hold down the Start button, say a simple command like "Start a Voice Note" or "Show me the weather today," and see the relevant app or widget in a few seconds. I still recommend using watch face shortcuts to pull up relevant data since the processing is a bit slow, but it helps avoid searching through menus.</p><p>While I usually rely on AllTrails on my phone for picking hiking trails in advance, Garmin's new round-trip routes let me look for alternate side trails that'll take the same amount of time but let me check out new scenery, and it's a nice change of pace!</p><p>Plus, you get the same revamped health sensor suite as the Venu 3, similar dive features to the Descent MK3 with leak-proof hardware, dual-band GPS accuracy to match the best Forerunner watches, and a built-in flashlight that's quite similar to the one I tested in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>. Its 17-day battery life isn't much higher than other Garmin watches, but its 35-hour multi-band tracking is excellent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-track-summary-flashlight" alt="A track run summary on the Garmin Fenix 8, with the built-in LED flashlight on and visible and the intensity menu shown on the side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfzQt4nrHePNEf59bYqpKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, these are welcome additions! Garmin threw everything it had into one titanium package, so you can go from hiking to running to diving to skiing to golfing and have pretty much everything you need.</p><p>But I bring up past Garmin watches because many of these old features feel virtually identical to the cheaper watches. For example, the Fenix 8 LED is nice for emergencies but not especially bright, burns through your whole battery in a few hours, and makes you hold your wrist at an unnatural angle to illuminate what's in front of you — just like the Instinct 2X Solar flashlight.</p><p>The Fenix's new mic and speaker enable impromptu calls without grabbing your phone, but just like the Venu 3 and Venu 2 Plus, you'll sound quiet on the other end, and you may need to hold the speaker close to your ear if you're anywhere loud.</p>

<p>I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">not a big fan of MIP displays</a>, so I'm fully on board with the AMOLED switch. That said, it has the same size and PPI as the Venu 3 or Forerunner 965 displays, and I <em>think</em> the brightness and refresh rate are identical, too. In particular, I dislike the little delay you see when scrolling through widgets with the touchscreen.</p><p>In terms of accuracy, the Fenix 8 GPS has been predictably hyper-accurate thus far, but that also applies across the board down to the $350 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> with dual-band tracking. And while its heart rate tracking did excellently against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS optical armband</a> in <em>most</em> cases, matching its average and keeping up with quick HR changes, it has the same <strong>infuriating</strong> issue as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>: When I start a hard track run without ramping up, it'll spend the first lap failing to register my faster heart rate by about 20–30 bpm, forcing me to pause and give the Fenix 8 time to find the correct data and skewing my aerobic/ anaerobic load totals.</p>

<p>I suspect many well-off Fenix 8 buyers choose the flagship version as a combination status symbol and catch-all fitness tool. They like its titanium style and that it <em>can</em> handle every sport under the sun, even if they only go diving or skiing once a year during vacations and mostly run, bike, or hike with it. Better to have and not need than need and not have, right?</p><p>In my case, the Fenix 8 may end up being my favorite Garmin watch because it collects the best bits from the Forerunner, Venu, and Instinct lineups. But is that enough to say the Fenix 8 is "worth the price," as a lot of current Fenix 8 reviews say?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 isn't a cheap watch, but it's ultimately up to you to determine whether it's worth the high price tag.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When journalists and tech YouTubers say a device is so good that they'd spend $1,000+ on it, they probably mean it. But they <em>didn't</em>; they got it for free. We generally try not to let that impact our recommendations, and there's no pressure to justify or nitpick an expensive purchase like regular consumers feel. But it's still hard to say if something is "too expensive" when your budget isn't affected.</p><p>When I reviewed expensive smartwatches like the $650 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or $800 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, I had to carefully judge their true value when you can spend half as much on their siblings and get most of the same features (like the Fenix 8). They're great watches but too expensive for many people, and the Fenix 8 deserves that scrutiny, too.</p><p>One point in Apple and Samsung's favor was that their flagship watches were technically "standalone" thanks to built-in LTE support. Since Garmin hasn't offered LTE outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Bounce LTE</a> for kids, your Fenix 8 still has your short-lived smartphone as a pain point for staying in touch on long excursions.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my case, the Fenix 8 is <em>very</em> nice to have, especially the new navigation features. But I don't "need" it, and if I were shopping for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watch</a> for my needs, it'd be hard to justify spending that extra $500 for streamlined software, voice commands, and dynamic routing when the $600 Forerunner 965 has most of the same essentials.</p><p>I've hyped up the Fenix in my head for a while, and an $1,100 price tag implies a certain level of greatness. But the familiar tech, buggy launch, and lack of emergency cellular combined with that price are enough to offset slightly just how fantastic a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> this is.</p>

Users can swipe down the "Chats" screen to see the default filters at the top, where they can now access the new "+" button.</p><p>Similar to the favorites filter, WhatsApp notes that users "can add both groups and one-on-one chats to a list, and any list you create will appear in the filter bar."</p><p>The ability to create new lists will be available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platform</a> users starting Thursday (Oct 31), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/focus-on-what-matters-with-custom-lists">WhatsApp notes</a> that the wider rollout of the feature is expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The new addition comes after WhatsApp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-likely-to-have-userames-soon">recently announced</a> the ability to privately add contacts through WhatsApp Web and also via Windows platforms or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>.</p><p>Previously, the ability to add a new contact was only possible through the user's primary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> or iOS handset—by adding a phone number or scanning a QR code. The messaging platform's emphasis on the introduction of these new capabilities is to eventually "manage and save contacts by usernames."</p><p>Another interesting development is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-on-whatsapp-to-give-users-a-more-personalized-response">chat memory feature</a> for Meta AI on the platform. For those who frequently use the AI assistant, the chatbot will soon have a memory feature that allows users to store their preferences to get a more personalized response when they chat with the assistant.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>You can now enjoy faster video loading and improved quality on Telegram, with automatic adjustments based on your network, though you can still choose your preferred quality manually.</li><li>The latest update also has a new feature that lets you change video speed easily by tapping the settings icon or long-pressing the right side of the screen.</li><li>You can also add media to old messages without having to delete and resend. Just two taps to swap or tweak.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Telegram’s latest update is here, and it brings faster video loading, better quality, speed controls, message edit timestamps, handy media attachments, and more features.</p><p>One big upgrade is automatic video quality adjustment for large channels, tuning playback to match your network speed, as per Telegram&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/dynamic-video-quality-and-more" target="_blank">post</a>. But if you prefer, you can still pick between high, medium, or low quality manually.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-telegram-premium">Telegram</a> is also rolling out a new way to change video playback speed for everyone. Simply hit the settings icon during playback or hold down on the right side of the video to adjust it.</p><p>Playback goes back to normal as soon as you let go. Plus, Android users can quickly jump through videos by just doubling-taping the left or right side to rewind or skip ahead by 10 seconds.</p><p>Furthermore, Telegram has a nifty new feature that lets you throw media into old messages without deleting and resending. With just two taps, you can tweak photos or swap out any media in your chats.</p><p>Another useful feature is message timestamps. You can now check when a message was last edited, and if it’s been tweaked a few times, it’ll show you the latest edit. This little touch adds clarity and makes chats way more reliable.</p><p>Additionally, you can now use chat-specific hashtags to easily sift through content, making it simple to find what you’re looking for. Plus, bots and mini-apps can tap into Telegram’s ad revenue-sharing program and shoot out up to 30 messages. And if you’re curious about how your posts are doing, you can check out the exact number of reactions, so you get the scoop on your engagement.</p><p>With more people relying on video and image sharing through their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a> like Telegram, there’s a growing demand for better visual communication. Telegram’s latest update hits the mark by rolling out a bunch of features aimed at making video sharing and viewing even better.</p>

It may not be the wealthiest or the most recognizable, but the company manufactures the parts that make most of your tech stuff possible. TSMC is the company that makes chips for Apple, Qualcomm, and almost everyone else.</p><p>It's not the company that designs the chips or figures out ways to make them better. It literally is the company that turns silicon wafers and rare metals into processors, and it's found itself smack dab in the middle of the U.S. fight with China.</p>

<p>To begin with, it appears that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) didn't do anything wrong and is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/business/tsmc-huawei-computer-chips.html">victim of some sort of tech component fraud</a>. In any case, some of the parts it manufactures have been found in Huawei's Ascend 910B AI accelerator, which is something that the U.S. "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-devices-are-losing-support-for-android-apps-heres-why-its-a-good-thing">forbids</a>." These chips are officially made by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">China-based SMIC</a> (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp), but it's been reported that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asiatimes.com/2024/06/low-yield-for-smic-huawei-nvidia-knockoff-so-what/">the company is unable to meet demand</a>.</p><p>A different client <strong>not</strong> under U.S. sanctions apparently bought the parts and supplied them to Huawei without TSMC's knowledge. TSMC discovered the issue and self-reported to both the Tawainese government and the U.S. Department of Commerce on October 11.</p><p>The U.S. can't do anything directly to any company that is not inside the country, but what it can do may be worse — it can forbid any company that wants to do business inside the United States from supplying anything, real goods or technology included, to a sanctioned entity like Huawei. That means it can tell Apple not to use TSMC, and it can tell Qualcomm that if it wants to sell products to U.S. customers, it can't deal with TSMC either, due to any perceived business between TSMC and Huawei. It's effectively a death sentence.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.88%;"><img id="Bv65j4HeYum7Ej3M5ADmhP" name="snapdragon-888-module.jpg" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon 888" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bv65j4HeYum7Ej3M5ADmhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="495" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first, it sounded like TSMC was in hot water, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Either way, the company has to withstand an investigation by the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which will be forced to report the findings to the U.S. Congress. That's something we shouldn't wish on our worst enemies.</p><p>It's good that TSMC is not only clear of any wrongdoing but also did the right thing even though it knew what was going to happen. Not all giant corporations would do the same. It's even more important to us that we won't see sanctions against TSMC, which would wreck the tech landscape.</p>
<p>I know we all hate it when I use Apple as an example, but it's the easy way to demonstrate what I mean, so I'm going with it.</p><p>Apple has TSMC make 100% (effectively) of the chips inside every product it sells that use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-m1-chip-helping-apple-expand-its-brand-lock">Apple's in-house processors</a>. That means with every iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc., TSMC has to continue to increase its manufacturing capacity in order to meet demand from Apple and its other clients, so business is booming.</p><p>Now imagine all those products without anyone to build the chips that power them. The big companies like Apple and Samsung, who can manufacture their own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/all-new-cortex-x-exynos-chip-will-supercharge-industry">Exynos chips</a>, would survive after a dismal year or two, but the Motorolas and OnePluses of the world would cease to exist if TSMC went "offline" like this and they were unable to get new products built until an alternative was found.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C2Fb9YHDByQRHztHsMAQsk" name="exynos-generic.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos processor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C2Fb9YHDByQRHztHsMAQsk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's a big part of the problem; there is no real alternative. There are other foundries — TSMC does not exist in a bubble — but none have the capacity or technology to match TSMC. That's why Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, and everyone else use them. They build a superior product when it comes to yield and die size, and that's what chip companies need.</p>
<p>I've been following this story for a week or so, and at first, I was concerned. The U.S. has an election coming up (as if you haven't noticed), and there is no telling how a Trump administration Commerce Department would react should he win. If sanctions were placed against TSMC similar to what Huawei is dealing with, the tech landscape would be ruined. Thankfully, the full story isn't so bleak.</p><p>TSMC will have to deal with a few million miles of U.S. government red tape, members of Congress will huff and puff to show their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">disdain for all things China</a>, and it should remain business as usual when it comes to having access to the products we love to use.</p><p>It just goes to show that good things can happen when a company does the right thing instead of trying to hide evidence and delete messages, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/tech/judge-google-deleted-chat-logs-antitrust-case/index.html">right Google</a>?</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">here</a>.</p><p>Big tech earnings began this week, and Samsung announced its quarterly report on Thursday. While these can be kind of boring, sometimes interesting details can arise from them regarding a company's near-term plans. Samsung's summary of its Q3 2024 financial report highlighted its various businesses and gave us a glimpse into its plans for 2025 regarding phones, XR, and more.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the company plans to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> in the first half of 2025. If we go by last year's schedule, we can expect the phone to launch in January, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">stable One UI 7 update</a>. However, that may not be the only exciting phone coming next year, as Samsung seemingly teased a cheaper foldable could be in the works to help promote adoption and offer competitively priced devices. Samsung has previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-it-has-no-plans-to-make-a-cheaper-foldable-but-why">dismissed the idea of a cheaper foldable</a>, so we hope the company provides.</p><p>Finally, Samsung made a small mention of "XR devices" and its desire for the Samsung Health platform to take advantage of what we can assume will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Glasses</a>, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/game-changing-google-maps-enhanced-navigation-update-arrives-next-month">here</a>.</p><p>A decade after Google Maps started guiding users to the correct lane during navigation, the company is now making it even easier to see which lane you should be in. With an update to Google Maps coming to Android phones and iPhones this month, users will be able to clearly see which lane they need to be in and when, thanks to a zoomed-in view.</p><p>This will initially be available in 30 cities in the U.S., but Google plans to eventually expand the feature outside North America as well as to Android Auto and Carplay.</p><p>Gemini is also getting some Maps integration and can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-ask-google-maps-for-spot-and-activity-ideas-thanks-to-gemini">provide ideas for activities</a>, showing users various review summaries of places to figure out the vibe. There are a ton of other updates as well, such as help with parking, navigation to places from where you've parked, expanded user reports, and more, which you should start to see rolling out through November.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">here</a>.</p><p>OpenAI's ChatGPT changed the game with generative AI to the point where many saw that Google was playing catch-up with the company. Now, OpenAI is playing catch-up with Google with its latest effort: ChatGPT search.</p><p>While you can still converse with ChatGPT naturally to get answers to queries, ChatGPT search will scour the web and display relevant results to users. This can happen within a chat, or users can manually begin a search, as a dedicated button will be integrated into the chat UI, making it a secondary component.</p><p>Furthermore, ChatGPT will make it easy to access sources, with links just under the results and accessible via a Sources bar on the side that you can open with just a click.</p><p>OpenAI says this will initially be available on the web and its apps for certain users, such as ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as those on the SearchGPT waitlist, while all free users will eventually have access to the feature.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">here</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is officially here, although not for everyone. The phone has launched in China, with a global launch expected later this year or at the top of 2025, but this initial launch gives us a full look at the phone and what we can expect when it comes to the rest of the world.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 features a mostly flat 6.8-inch 2K OLED display that has a slight curve on all sides. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate and is incredibly bright, with a 4500 nit peak. On the back is a triple camera setup consisting of three 50MP cameras, including a 120-degree ultrawide and 3x telephoto lens.</p><p>The phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, meaning you'll have some of the latest features like Circle to Search and more.</p><p>Powering everything is Qualcomm's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and up to 24GB of RAM, meaning the phone is well equipped for the AI era and will have plenty of power. And keeping the lights on is a massive 6,000mAh battery that supports 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging. There is magnetic charging, but only if you use a case.</p><p>The phone is available now for preorder in China, but we'll be on the lookout for a global launch.</p>

<p>Read more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-certified-refurbished-pixel-program-detailed">here</a>.</p><p>Google has finally launched a Certified Refurbished program where it sells Pixel phones at a discount. These are fully inspected, with Google checking the battery, housing, and screens "for any imperfections" and using "authentic Google parts" to repair them if and when needed.</p><p>The Certified Refurbished program consists of the Pixel 6 and newer devices, with the phones discounted as much as 40% off and still getting the same one-year warranty as a new Pixel. Google also says the devices will feature the latest Android software, although it's important to note that as of October 2024, support for OS upgrades on the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Pixel 6 Pro</a> has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-android-15-update-upgrade-decision">officially ended</a>, meaning the devices will only receive security updates until 2026.</p><p>Google isn't the first to offer such a program, with Samsung continuously adding Galaxy phones to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-series-certified-re-newed">Certified Renewed program</a>. Still, it's good to see Google making the effort to bring more sustainable options, even if we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-certified-refurbished-prices-are-uncompetitive">question the pricing of these devices</a>.</p>

The fact that it was able to outmuscle Qualcomm to do so is all the more impressive.</p><p>A part of this has to do with the hardware itself; while Qualcomm is just now starting to use performance cores throughout in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, MediaTek has been at it for over 12 months, with both the Dimensity 9300/9300+ and 9400 powered entirely by performance cores.</p><p>Doing so allows MediaTek-powered devices to deliver better multi-core results, and that has been the case in my testing. Phones featuring the Dimensity 9300/9300+ — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a> — have among the highest scores in Geekbench&apos;s multi-core workloads, and while they still don&apos;t quite measure up to the A18 Pro in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, they&apos;re better than anything else available on Android.</p>

<p>The biggest endorsement for MediaTek&apos;s efforts in this segment is by Samsung, which is using the Dimensity 9300+ exclusively on its Galaxy Tab S10 series tablets globally. Sure, Samsung&apos;s high-end tablets don&apos;t rack up anywhere as many sales as the brand&apos;s Galaxy S24 series, but the fact that the manufacturer went with MediaTek hardware in all regions — including North America — is a vote of confidence.</p><p>It&apos;s a similar story with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a>, MediaTek&apos;s answer to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The Dimensity 9400 uses the latest Cortex X925 core alongside Cortex X4 and A720 cores, and it is powering OPPO&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-wait-is-over-oppos-find-x8-and-x8-pro-are-launching-globally">Find X8</a> and 8 Pro as well as Vivo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">X200 devices</a>.</p><p>Although these devices don&apos;t have a huge presence in western markets yet, they sell in the millions in China, and OPPO and Vivo are making some progress in the high-end category in countries like India.</p>

<p>As to why a phone manufacturer would use MediaTek instead of Qualcomm, cost is likely a factor in the consideration, but most brands I talked to mention customizability as a big differentiator. MediaTek offers the ability to tailor its Dimensity platform to particular devices, and OnePlus used this to good effect in its mid-range devices in recent years.</p><p>Rivalry is a good thing in this industry, and while Qualcomm is still the dominant brand, it&apos;s good to see MediaTek offering a platform that can hold its own. Vivo&apos;s X100 Pro is one of my favorite phones of 2024, and it is just as performant as the dozens of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>-powered devices I used over the course of the year.</p><p>With Qualcomm going back to fully-custom designs after nearly a decade, it will be interesting to see how the Dimensity 9400 — which has Arm&apos;s latest cores — holds up in real-world usage against Qualcomm. </p>

The OnePlus 12, one of our favorite Android phones on the market today, is currently sitting on the retailer&apos;s site with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-256gb-unlocked-silky-black/6570636.p"><strong>a whopping $150 discount</strong></a>. That&apos;s the same price drop that we saw during Amazon&apos;s Prime Day sale in October, and we&apos;re still almost a month away from Black Friday! </p><p>True, the discount comes in the wake of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13 reveal</a> in China a few days ago, but since there&apos;s no global release date for that phone yet, this is the best that OnePlus currently has to offer at well below the retail price. No trade-in required, no strings attached. </p>

<p>Here at Android Central, it's no secret that we're massive fans of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. While the eye-catching flagship may lack some of the AI features found in its Samsung and Google counterparts, the OnePlus 12 is a champ where it counts. You get lightning-fast Snapdragon performance straight out of the box, plus a vibrant AMOLED 120Hz display, a two-day battery, and some of the best camera tech you'll ever use. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 12 earned the top spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2024, not because it&apos;s the most powerful or innovative device that we&apos;ve ever used, but because it has the perfect balance of elegant, sophisticated design with butter-smooth performance and a price tag that won&apos;t demolish your bank account. After all, there&apos;s a good reason why so many folks compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24">OnePlus 12 with the Samsung Galaxy S24</a> when shopping for a new smartphone. </p><p>While you&apos;ll miss out on some of those fancy AI features that other brands have been prioritizing lately, with the OnePlus 12 you&apos;re getting a phone that&apos;s simply great at being a phone. If all you need is a stylish device with great battery life, fast performance, and awesome camera software, then the OnePlus 12 is a great deal — <em>especially </em>when you compare it with an early Black Friday discount at Best Buy. </p>

<ul><li>Google is starting to roll out a slew of new Gemini extensions, including the Google Home app.</li><li>Users enrolled in the Public Preview for Google Home should start seeing the integration in the Gemini app for Android this week, with a gradual rollout over the next few weeks.</li><li>You'll be able to ask Gemini to make changes to your Home in natural language, and the Gemini extension will replace the Google Assistant.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini is on a path to replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and it's about to gain crucial functionality once reserved for Assistant. Soon, users will be able to control their smart home with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> extension in the Gemini app. It's rolling out now for users enrolled in the Public Preview for Google Home on Android, and the gradual rollout will continue over the coming weeks.</p><p>After you gain access to the new Google Home extension, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> will be able to use this newfound integration to control your smart home without needing to invoke the Google Assistant. The extension can activate scenes, change the status of connected accessories, and more. What's different about using Gemini for these purposes instead of Assistant? You can use natural language to get things done instead of using specific word choice.</p><p>Specifically, Google explains that telling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> the phrase "the sun is too bright in the living room" will result in the AI assistant closing the smart window blinds in your home. The company also gives an example of using "help me clean up the kitchen" to start a robot vacuum.</p>

<p>To try out these new features, open the <strong>Google Home app</strong> on your Android device. Tap the <strong>Settings</strong> button, then select <strong>Public Preview</strong>. From there, press <strong>Join Public Preview</strong> to enroll your account. You should soon gain access to the Google Home extension for Gemini.</p><p>There are a few limitations to note, though. It's only available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and is restricted to English prompts. Additionally, Gemini can't control smart security devices, such as gates, cameras, locks, doors, and garage doors. On devices that don't have Gemini, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest smart speakers</a> and displays, you'll still be using Google Assistant.</p><p>You can try the Google Home extension in the Gemini app today if you're enrolled in the early preview, and a wider release is likely to follow in the future.</p>

Google has agreed to pay CAD 100 million yearly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cjc-ccj.ca/en/">Canadian Journalism Collective</a> (CJC), a federally incorporated nonprofit organization created to distribute funds allocated under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-response-canada-bill-c-18">Online News Act</a>. The CRTC also stipulated that additional news outlets be allowed to join CJC to qualify for funds.</p><p>If you're not a Canadian let me help this make some more sense. Canada passed the Online News Act to force companies like Google or Meta—which use small portions of news articles in search results—to negotiate a fair price for the use of these snippets. The CRTC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2024/2024-262.htm">has decided</a> that Google will pay CAD 100 million per year to the CJC which will then disperse funds to news organizations affected by Google's use.</p><p>It seems that being plagued by bureaucracy is not exclusive to the U.S.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of laws like Canada's Online News Act. I can tell you from experience that becoming featured by a company like Google is 100% a net positive, even if the company used a small portion of your text in a snippet or AI summary. In my opinion, as long as Google links back to the source (it does) anyone interested in reading more than a headline will follow through to the original source.</p><p>Regardless of how I feel about these types of laws, it is the law in Canada, and companies like Google, Apple, and Meta who aggregate and disseminate news summaries are bound by it. Other countries have similar laws.</p><p>I'll also assume that these laws are in place because government bodies like the CRTC believe they serve the interests of the citizens they are charged with serving. Forget about partisanship or left versus right for a moment; federal agencies are supposed to look out for our best interests regardless of where we live.</p>

<p>Then there is the reality. Laws like Canada's Online News Act are designed to prop up an industry that's currently struggling by having companies that are struggling less provide funding. If part of the reason for the decline is that Google and Meta are "stealing" the synopsis of an article for their aggregation feed, that's fine. Google and Meta should compensate news organizations that provide the content from which they make a huge profit. My opinion that one could leverage being featured by Google or Meta in a lucrative way doesn't matter because I am not a government official.</p><p>It's the CRTC's job to assist news organizations, too. A news outlet is not a citizen, but there should be a government agency that ensures things are done fairly by both sides. The Canadian government has a responsibility not to let Canadian news organizations die. And no, that's not socialism; a government serving the interests of business is the opposite, so save your comment.</p><p>I ask you then, was CAD 100 million enough? Is that number going to keep Canada's news industry alive in times when Google and other tech companies "steal" their content for financial gain? To Google, 100 million Canadian dollars is a laughable amount. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q3-2024-earnings">"earns" that much without even trying</a>.</p><p>This is why I dislike these types of laws. Google should be forced to allow companies to opt out of its search and news services until it has reached an agreement with each individual organization. A smaller company may only be "worth" paying $200,000 a year to use its content, while a large company like the NYT or Washington Post can negotiate for more. Having a lump sum paid out through yet another government body is another way Google wins even when it has lost.</p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit reported new read receipt indicators for RCS chats in Google Messages and an APK teardown provided more insight.</li><li>Per the teardown, Google is testing a change in Messages that moves those sent/delivered indicators inside the bubble with your text.</li><li>A Reddit user discovered that you'd have to press and hold a message and drag it to view the time it was sent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly developing a redesign for its RCS text indicators in Messages.</p><p>The company is developing a (type of) "in-line" read receipt notification for its RCS-enabled chats. Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/google_messages_read_receipt_ui_changed_for_me/">Reddit have reported</a> these new indicators on their devices while in the Google Messages beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-read-receipt-rollout-3496172/">Android Authority</a>). More importantly, the publication conducted an APK dive of the recent beta version (messages.android_20241029_00_RC00)</p><p>From screenshots shared on Reddit to the publication's teardown, these new indicators will occupy the right-most corner of your text bubble.</p><p>Further digging shows that the animations have changed, too. According to the post, sending a message is accompanied by an ellipsis (three dots) before turning into a single check mark. A second check mark — or part of it — appears against the first, showing that the message has been sent and delivered successfully.</p><p>These new receipt indicators are (potentially) always present in the text thread no matter the number of messages. This contrasts how Messages is currently where the most recently sent text displays its RCS sent/delivered indicators. Additionally, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/comment/lut1874/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user on Reddit</a> in the beta states Google changed how you can see the time of a text.</p><p>The user states users must "hold and pull the screen to see the time the message came/sent." After, the app will automatically drop the text to cover those extra details.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/google_messages_read_receipt_ui_changed_for_me">Google messages Read receipt u.i changed for me.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As the test expands to more users, it's unclear when Google will roll this out. Reports of these revamped indicators were posted recently, so the company will likely wait a while for feedback/testing before pushing it to everyone.</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google Messages used to (digitally) say "Sending..." and "Sent" when texting others. That changed last year when the company introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-new-read-receipts">the new checkmarks</a> we've become accustomed to seeing in the app. With this change looming, Google moves them from beneath your message, beside the time, to inside the bubble with your text.</p><p>Aside from your texts, it was reported recently that Google Messages could receive extra privacy options through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-adding-profile-discovery-privacy-feature">Profile Discovery</a>. Such options include showing your name and profile icon to "people you message," "only contacts," or "no one." These additions were discovered on the setup screen for the Messages app.</p>
