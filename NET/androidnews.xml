<p>I&apos;ve tried giving up on smartwatches, honestly. It gets annoying when you have to remember to charge something other than a phone all of the time. But there are a few reasons why I cycle between the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch, and others, and Samsung just gave me another great reason to stick with wearing them with its latest smartwatches.</p><p>I&apos;ll start by saying that I&apos;m a sucker for keeping track of my sleep, as I can look at how long I was asleep and have a pretty idea of how the day is going to go. Instead of wondering why I feel like crap, I already know it&apos;d probably be due to the 3.5 hours of sleep that I&apos;m averaging.  </p><p>However, there&apos;s another potential reason, and it&apos;s one that I&apos;ve been avoiding for years — sleep apnea. For reasons that will become clear momentarily, I never thought that any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> would be capable of detecting sleep apnea.</p><p>In most instances, if you think you suffer from sleep apnea, you talk to your doctor and then perform a sleep study. However, introducing such a feature with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">Watch Ultra</a> will hopefully remove some guesswork. Instead of going to your doctor and just telling them that you&apos;re tired, you can <em>hopefully</em> use the data from your smartwatch to provide some support to your theory.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-gave-me-a-real-reason-to-upgrade-2">Samsung gave me a real reason to upgrade</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-heart-rate.jpeg" alt="A heart rate graph on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ugwKVbQyzkfAMSnmKCK859.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s the introduction of this functionality that has me actually intrigued about picking up one of these. Over the years, I just assumed that I was put on this planet for the purpose of being exhausted. It wasn&apos;t until I began dating my now-wife that I realized something else might be going on. </p><p>There were several times when she would wake me up in the middle of the night, seemingly for no reason. As it turns out, she was doing it for a good reason: she would wake up in the middle of the night, and it would sound like I wasn&apos;t breathing. </p><p>Things got a little better after I lost about 50 pounds, but according to my wife, it still happens on occasion. The difference now is that if I&apos;m being woken up in the middle of the night, it&apos;s because something might be wrong with our five-month-old son.</p>

<p>If I turn off the "tech enthusiast" part of my brain and think about the potential health benefits and not just because it&apos;s something "new and shiny," a new Galaxy Watch might be in the cards. The only reason why I haven&apos;t pre-ordered one for myself just yet is because the feature is apparently coming to the Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p>When pairing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a> running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6 beta</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it appeared in the "new features" section. However, I have yet to be able to find any mention of it since, so I&apos;m not entirely convinced that it&apos;s going to work. At this point, I&apos;ll probably re-evaluate whether I&apos;ll upgrade or just stick with what I&apos;ve got.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-health-sensors-illuminated.jpg" alt="The new Bioactive health sensor on the Galaxy Watch Ultra being illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gy2WHbiMy3wRLnjTiLVHBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another reason that could drive me to upgrade anyway, and it&apos;s <em>partially</em> because of the "new and shiny" factor. With the Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, Samsung introduced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">new and enhanced BioActive sensor</a>. Samsung claims this will offer "more precise readings," thanks to the new array of LEDs paired with an "increased number of green, red, and infrared LEDs."</p><p>On paper, this should result in more accurate and reliable tracking, which should make the Watch 7 a better health accessory than its predecessor. </p>
<h2 id="use-your-noggin-2">Use your noggin</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpg" alt="ECG on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s important for me to note that I called the Watch 7 a health "accessory" and didn&apos;t use a different adjective. You&apos;ll have to dig back into the Android Central archives a bit, but our own Jerry Hildenbrand wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch">something similar</a>. </p><p>Besides being a fantastic article, Jerry rightly points out that all of these various wearable devices can&apos;t replace actual equipment. I mean that in the sense of the equipment found in your doctor&apos;s office, it is not something you can pick up from Amazon or Best Buy. </p><p>The technology in our devices continues to evolve regularly, even in ways that you might not have known about. Wearable devices are even more prone to dramatic improvements, as there are regulatory hurdles to clear before a company can tell you that a smartwatch keeps track of your heart rate.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As Jerry says, "If you think something isn't right, go see the doctor and make sure. You can still enjoy your smartwatch even if it's not the caretaker of everything the company that sells it told you it was."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, these are also mass-produced on a completely different scale compared to health equipment. Companies need to make as many wearables as they can based on projected sales figures and available components. This is not a bad thing, but it&apos;s just something to keep in the back of your mind if you want to let a smartwatch tell you that everything&apos;s okay when it&apos;s actually the opposite. </p>

<p>Even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">surprising FDA approval</a>, Samsung&apos;s smartwatch can&apos;t tell you with any degree of certainty that you do, or don&apos;t, have sleep apnea. What it does do is nudge you in the right direction, suggesting that you reach out to your doctor or another healthcare professional. </p><p>I know that this probably sounds like I&apos;m doing a lot of mental gymnastics to justify buying the "latest and greatest." However, that&apos;s not actually the case this time around, as the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra offer legitimate health benefits that aren&apos;t found elsewhere. </p>

Although the Galaxy Z Fold line was once considered the best, that&apos;s no longer the case as the competition continues to impress. Leaving us wondering what could be in store for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. </p><p>Part of this is evidenced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which saw very little in the way of any meaningful upgrades. Even still, one could argue that Samsung stands above the rest in terms of the software experience you&apos;ll find on the Fold. </p><p>With that being said, there are a few things that we hope to see Samsung change with its next flagship foldable phone. </p>
<h2 id="we-apos-re-long-overdue-for-better-cameras-2">We&apos;re long overdue for better cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nkmhx4yX3wXqVzeKdqNx7n" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Looking through the camera viewfinder on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nkmhx4yX3wXqVzeKdqNx7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s 2024, and Samsung&apos;s most expensive phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, largely relies on the same camera system found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Fold 4</a> from 2022. The only difference that the Fold 6 offers over its last two predecessors is an upgraded ultrawide camera. This sensor retains the same 12MP resolution, but Samsung claims it offers better low-light quality and can record video in 4K at 60fps. </p><p>Meanwhile, the 50MP main wide-angle lens and 10MP telephoto camera remain unchanged. It&apos;s particularly disheartening when you see what Samsung&apos;s cameras are capable of, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Tack on the exorbitant price tag, and it makes little sense for Samsung to continue using the same camera array.</p><p>We can only assume the reason why substantial changes have yet to arrive is due to the size of the sensors that Samsung relies on. There&apos;s only a finite amount of space beneath the frame of the phone, which also has to account for the multiple layers being used for the inner display. Which leads quite nicely into our next wishlist item. </p>
<h2 id="get-on-moto-apos-s-level-2">Get on Moto&apos;s level</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-03.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 main display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc9H6pcxQdLgW4mCZYcbDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels as though Samsung is paying closer attention to its Flip lineup than the Fold. One reason for this train of thought is due to the less noticeable crease. However, both devices still fall short of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus</a>, as those display creases are barely even noticeable. </p><p>For someone with experience using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, my brain has practically removed the crease the majority of the time. There is an exception to this, as the Galaxy Z Fold&apos;s crease rears its ugly head whenever I jot down some notes with the S Pen. </p><p>Although it&apos;s been almost three years since Samsung added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen support</a>, there&apos;s still a feeling of unease when dragging the stylus across the middle of the screen. Plus, the crease always ends up getting in the way, ultimately resulting in using the S Pen less.</p>
<h2 id="pwm-friendly-displays-2">PWM-friendly displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ThMsF38PkmaF6GbYWp2gwR" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-display-headache.jpg" alt="Getting a headache from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5's flickering AMOLED display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ThMsF38PkmaF6GbYWp2gwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Keeping with the Galaxy Z Fold 7&apos;s display, we <em>really</em> want Samsung to get better when it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flicker rates</a>. The company is arguably the worst offender, and while the Z Fold 6 is a bit better than the Fold 5, it&apos;s still nowhere near usable for those affected by PWM.</p><p>Making matters worse is that Samsung won&apos;t even talk about its display dimming, potentially providing some type of explanation. Meanwhile, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-interesting-display-tricks">companies like Honor</a> have started using PWM flicker rates as selling points. It&apos;s just a shame when you consider that Samsung does make some of the best-looking displays. </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the reasons why Samsung seems to be focusing more on the Galaxy Z Flip line is simply because of higher sales numbers. Although Huawei overtook Samsung in terms of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-foldable-smartphone-market-q1-2024/">Global Foldable Smartphone Shipments</a>" in Q1 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is largely keeping Samsung from dropping lower.</p><p>There&apos;s a good chance of this being attributed to the more attractive price tag, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Flip 5</a> retailed for $999, compared to the $1,799 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-how-it-started-how-its-going">Fold 5</a>. Even with a price increase of $100 for both the Flip 6 and Fold 6, we&apos;re still expecting the Flip 6 to vastly outsell the Fold 6. </p><p>It&apos;s a bit of a contradiction, given the price hike of this year&apos;s Galaxy foldable phones, but perhaps it&apos;s time to see what a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">Galaxy Z Fold FE</a> lineup would look like. Samsung could even just rebrand the Z Fold 6 as the Z Fold 7 FE, knock a decent chunk off the price, and it could just be enough to entice people away from slab phones.</p><p>It could be something that Samsung is already considering. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cheaper-galaxy-z-fold-6-codename-potentially-discovered">January 2024</a>, a third Samsung foldable phone appeared in databases, codenamed "Q6A." The Galaxy Z Fold 6 that was just released featured a codename of "Q6," leading to speculation of the potential of an A-series Galaxy Z Fold. Unfortunately, Galaxy Unpacked came and went with no sign or mention of such a device.</p>

<p>More than a year and a half after its introduction, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">still have yet to see Qi2</a> implemented in Android devices. There was hope this would change with the Galaxy S24 series, to no avail. Six months later, Samsung&apos;s flagship foldables are still sporting the old Qi standard. </p><p>While Qi2 accessories aren&apos;t as plentiful, Apple already beat Samsung to the punch with the iPhone 15 series. We really aren&apos;t sure what the potential hold-up is with the lack of Qi2 adoption. However, we&apos;re also hopeful that will change with Android released towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Wireless power sharing, known as PowerShare, used to be a handy feature on Samsung smartwatches for quick charges.</li><li>However, Samsung removed this feature in its latest Galaxy Watch lineup due to a new sensor design, which increased the distance between the internal charging coil and the charging surface.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series makes up for it with improved health monitoring, thanks to the new BioActive sensor array that tracks Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Samsung has different priorities now. The South Korean tech giant&apos;s newest Galaxy Watch series has dropped wireless charging from compatible smartphones.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ae/support/mobile-devices/about-the-galaxy-watch7-series-wireless-charging-and-wireless-power-sharing-features/" target="_blank">support page</a> update, Samsung admitted a shift from its previous Galaxy Watch models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Watch 7 Ultra</a> do not support wireless charging from a paired Galaxy phone. X user Jordy Verboven was the first to notice this omission (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-say-goodbye-to-wireless-powershare/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... the #GalaxyWatch7 no longer supports wireless powershare https://t.co/RhOom0aorm<a href="https://twitter.com/JordyV27/status/1811338879900770361">July 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, some smartphones have a feature called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">wireless power sharing</a> that lets the phone&apos;s battery wirelessly charge compatible smartwatches just by placing them close together.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s version of this is called PowerShare, and it has been available on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">beloved Samsung smartwatches</a>, except for the latest models. While not a common feature, it was super handy for a quick charge when you needed it.</p><p>According to the support page, Samsung had to remove this feature due to a design change. The new sensor array required reshaping the rear glass on both Watch models. This change increased the distance between the internal wireless charging coil and the external charging surface, making the previous wireless power-sharing capability impossible.</p><p>Even without wireless power sharing, the Galaxy Watch 7 is a big leap in health monitoring. The new BioActive sensor array is more accurate and provides more detailed health metrics than before, as per Samsung. Notably, it can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">track Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)</a>, giving users valuable insights into their metabolic health.</p><p>Previous Galaxy Watch models consistently featured wireless charging via Samsung&apos;s PowerShare technology. Therefore, the noticeable absence of this feature in the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra comes as a bit of a surprise.</p><p>The new sensor design also means you have to use the charger that ships with the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra for the best results. Using older Galaxy Watch chargers can slow down charging and make the device overheat. So, Samsung suggests sticking with the included charger.</p>

<p>Rings as wearables have become increasingly popular in recent months, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy ring </a>officially launched, several other companies have started to up their game and come up with strategies to expand their markets worldwide. </p><p>In May, Amazfit’s first smart ring, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">Helio Ring</a>, was launched in the U.S. Now, according to Smartprix, it is making its way to India. SmartPrix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/amazfit-helio-smart-ring-to-debut-during-prime-day-sale-product-listing-spotted-on-amazon/">spotted</a> a detailed product listing of the Helio Ring on Amazon India’s website, and everything seemed similar to the U.S. product listing. </p><p>The listing states that the Helio Ring will feature a Titanium Alloy textured exterior, weigh around 4gm, and measure 2.6mm in thickness. It will be available in two sizes only: 10 and 12. </p><p>The smart ring is equipped with features like heart rate, SpO2 monitoring, and stress tracking. It further includes in-depth sleep monitoring, mental and physical readiness analysis, and sports data tracking. The screenshot gives information about the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="v6MnPhj4CK3mRJEbvybgYY" name="Amaze-fit-helio-amazon-india.jpg" alt="Amazfit Helio Amazon India listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6MnPhj4CK3mRJEbvybgYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the U.S. listing, we know that the size 10 smart ring will have an 18.5mAh battery, and the size 12 model has a 20.5mAh one. Both take approximately two hours to charge fully, and the ring is said to last for about four days. It also comes with a charger and an out-of-the-box instruction manual.</p><p>While most details seem to have been listed, the price remained missing. We assume that since the ring costs around $299.99 in the U.S., it will come at a similar price range for the Indian market as well, which could be around 25,000 INR.</p><p>When we checked on our end, the listing was taken down and didn&apos;t show up on Amazon&apos;s India site.

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-nas-should-i-buy-xa0-2">Which NAS should I buy? </h2>
<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you&apos;re going to need. That sets the basis for whether you should get a two-bay, four-bay, or a larger NAS server.</p><p>Synology is the largest manufacturer of NAS servers, and it sells dozens of products across various categories. Synology is known for its high-quality offerings, and its products are built to last. But the defining feature of Synology&apos;s NAS models is the software, with the web-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-manager-70">DiskStation Manager</a> setting the standard for this category.</p><p>If this is the first NAS you&apos;re buying and you don&apos;t want to invest a lot of money into a server, the Synology DiskStation DS223j is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-nas">best cheap NAS</a>. You&apos;re still getting all the best software features that Synology has to offer, and while you don&apos;t get as many drive bays as some devices, it is a great choice for those making their foray into this segment. If you don&apos;t mind spending a little extra cash, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">Synology DiskStation DS723+</a> is a great choice for most users. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-hard-drive-for-my-nas-xa0-2">How do I choose a hard drive for my NAS? </h2>
<p>Choosing the right hard drive for your NAS is just as vital as selecting the right enclosure. Because NAS enclosures are designed to run 24/7, there are NAS-focused hard drives available in the market. These models feature vibration resistance and are designed to handle the stresses of a 24/7 environment, and differ from your regular hard drives.</p><p>Another factor to consider when choosing a NAS hard drive is the speed. HDDs are usually available in either 5400rpm or 7200rpm, and the latter delivers better performance because the spindle moves at 7,200 rounds per minute. I&apos;ve used 5400rpm drives in NAS enclosures tailored for media streaming for years without any issues, but if you&apos;re building a more enthusiast-focused NAS and are looking for better performance, pick a model with a 7200rpm. </p><p>There are several NAS-focused hard drive product lines, with WD Red Plus and Seagate IronWolf dominating the sales charts. With drives starting out at 1TB and going all the way to 20TB, there&apos;s no shortage of options available across either product line. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, the 10th annual Prime Day shopping event is scheduled to begin on July 16th and run through the 17th. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Yep, the vast majority of Prime Day deals will only be available to Prime subscribers. If you&apos;re interested in shopping during the sale and you aren&apos;t a member just yet, we recommend taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can explore the benefits of Prime Day without paying a cent. Alternatively, you could just wait and see if Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors will launch rival sales that don&apos;t require a membership. </p>

You don&apos;t have to break the bank to protect your staggeringly pricey foldable&apos;s screens from damage.</p><p>We recommend the IMBZBK 9 in 1 for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Screen Protector as the best overall choice for any Fold 6 owner.

<p>Long, boring flights are the bane of modern first-world existence. Between having to sit still for hours and having little to do, these kinds of flights are generally no fun. And forget about working on a plane unless you enjoy neck pain or the potential of having your laptop smashed by the reclining seat in front of you.</p><p>That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">Meta Quest 3&apos;s airplane mode</a> is such a godsend. It allows the headset to be used on a plane and it works incredibly well, as is proven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEWD19ZS5Ww">countless</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO7Gs5JgBOQ">YouTube</a> videos and other customer feedback. But I haven&apos;t been able to adequately use the feature yet for one good reason: I can&apos;t fit the headset in my luggage.</p><p>As I was packing for my trip to see Samsung&apos;s latest at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-z-fold-6-flip-6-and-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Unpacked July 2024</a>, I realized that my suitcase was quickly running out of room. For a three-day trip, I had to pack clothes, electronics, my camera, cables, and all sorts of things into a suitcase and a backpack. Once all that was packed, I had a tiny cube of space that a VR headset simply wouldn&apos;t fit into.</p><p>It&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve run into time and time again over the past few weeks since the feature debuted — I travel quite a bit for this job — and while I&apos;m still going to try to fit it into a future trip, it&apos;s clear that the size of modern VR headsets is still prohibitive to some of the things we desperately want to use them for.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ni4J26hPnDEkbP9LQgTovY" name="holding-a-meta-quest-3-with-bobovr-m3-pro.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3 with a BoboVR M3 Pro head strap installed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ni4J26hPnDEkbP9LQgTovY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While everyone&apos;s travel situations are different, I&apos;ve found that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">best smart glasses</a> are better travel companions because of their smaller size. While most of these glasses are quite as small as a standard pair of glasses — that&apos;s especially true of smart display glasses like my favorite pair, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/">Viture Pro</a> — they&apos;re still substantially smaller than any standalone VR headset on the market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Smart display glasses are a much better travel companion because of the size and ease of use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Smart display glasses are effectively a giant virtual monitor that rests on your face. They attach to any device that supports USB-C display output — your phone, laptop, or even the Steam Deck — giving you the ability to relax and hold your head in a natural position instead of craning your neck down the whole time.</p><p>My colleague, Andrew Myrick, recently took Xreal Air 2s on a trip with him and they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">saved him from neck pain</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La" name="meta-quest-3-travel-case-versus-viture-one-travel-case.jpg" alt="Comparing the size of the Meta Quest 3 and Viture One travel cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Meta Quest headsets don&apos;t support this feature. You either have to sideload videos onto your headset and use a 3rd party app to play them — not something that&apos;s super user-friendly — or play an offline VR game you might have installed on your headset.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If the size didn't stop me, the fact that I can't plug my laptop directly into a Quest and use it as a virtual monitor would.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There&apos;s little hope of using one for working on a plane because you&apos;d need to connect to your laptop over a Wi-Fi network, and that usually doesn&apos;t work well on a plane.</p><p>I&apos;d <em>prefer</em> to use the Quest because the field of view is significantly wider than any pair of smart glasses on the market and I generally find the Quest&apos;s design quite comfortable over time, especially when using a headstrap like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-Pro-Accessories-conditioning-hot-swappable/dp/B0CSY8PD63/">BoboVR S3 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>It also does head tracking better than any pair of smart glasses on the market, making it feel more like you actually have a TV or monitor in front physically residing in front of you. Most smart glasses pin the display to your vision, meaning it moves around with your head. That can be particularly uncomfortable when there&apos;s turbulence on a plane, as trying to follow bouncy text can cause nausea.</p><p>The ironic thing is that smart glasses are often just as expensive as a Meta Quest headset. That feels a little silly, given that the Quest is a completely standalone console and the smart glasses are <em>just</em> a monitor, but sometimes you have to pay for convenience.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest carrying cases</a> can protect your Quest while traveling, but until the headsets get a lot smaller, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be taking one on too many flights.</p>

It&apos;s yet another shift after the Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6 Classic, but we suspect Samsung will stick with a Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 next year.</p><p>After Apple cleared the way to sell smartwatches for the price of a smartphone, Samsung quickly followed suit. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a> showcases all the ways it mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. During a private Q&A session, Samsung engineers told us they&apos;re focusing on making the "most premium" watch due to "market" forces, leaving its old Pro behind.</p><p>That&apos;s why we assume the Ultra series is here to stay, and that Samsung will release a Watch Ultra 2 next year. So, what do we expect Samsung to change next year, and what do we <em>want</em> them to change? Here&apos;s our Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 wishlist.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-crown-buttons-bezel-anything-2">Add a crown, buttons, bezel...anything!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-underside.jpg" alt="The underside of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite borrowing many design decisions from the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">didn&apos;t copy Apple in one key way</a>: there&apos;s no crown. Nor did Samsung give the Watch Ultra a physical or digital rotating bezel. You can only use touchscreen swipes and buttons to navigate. </p><p>Rugged titanium watches like these aren&apos;t strictly for athletes; many people buy them for the design, battery life, and extra protection. But for anyone wanting to use the Watch Ultra&apos;s dual-band GPS or new route-racing tool, you might be disappointed by the lack of tactile options when you&apos;re mid-run with sweaty fingertips.</p><p>We don&apos;t care <em>what</em> Samsung adds to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, as long as it&apos;s some physical option. A physical bezel like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>&apos;s might make it too heavy, so Samsung could consider adding a crown like many other Android watch-makers (Google Pixel, Ticwatch) or subtle buttons on the left-hand side like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> can stick with the digital bezel to keep it lightweight, if Samsung wants.</p>
<h2 id="new-health-tools-2">New health tools</h2>

<p>Samsung gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and Ultra 13 LEDs instead of four on the Watch 6, which supposedly makes them significantly more accurate for heart rate and blood oxygen data (especially during workouts). It says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">revamped Biosensor</a> can track your body&apos;s Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index, which is a warning sign for future body health issues like diabetes and heart failure.</p><p>We love this focus on health accuracy, combined with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> launch for better sleep tracking! We&apos;ve yet to test the improved HR sensors for ourselves, but we&apos;re optimistic. So we&apos;ll simply hope that the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 continues prioritizing health.</p><p>Maybe Samsung will finally make its blood pressure data accurate enough that the FDA approves it for U.S. usage. Or it&apos;ll jump from AGEs tracking to fully tracking blood glucose levels, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Samsung execs have said they&apos;re pursuing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="training-load-and-workout-recs-2">Training load and workout recs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-multisport.jpg" alt="Choosing a workout after pressing the action button on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s big fitness update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is its "Energy Score." It takes your heart rate, HRV, recent activities, and sleep quality to tell you how much energy you have for the day. It&apos;s a long-standing, popular feature on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> like Fitbit (Daily Readiness Score) and Garmin (Body Battery). Plus, Samsung added an FTP cycling test and new aerobic and anaerobic threshold heart rate zones.</p><p>When Wear OS 6 or 5.5 rolls around next year, we hope that Samsung takes things a step further from general body energy to physical readiness. Some watches will look at your recent activities and judge that you may be well-rested but still too sore to work out, recommending you wait X hours before your next one.</p><p>The other popular workout tool offered by Garmin and Apple is training load. It judges how your last week&apos;s workout intensity compares to past weeks, so you have data showing if you&apos;re improving or declining over time.</p><p>If Samsung gives the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 better tactile controls <em>and</em> new training load data, it&apos;ll quickly become one of the go-to fitness watch options for Android users, even compared to Garmin.</p>
<h2 id="going-full-squircle-2">Going full squircle?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5oNNwKxJoYJXY33fs2JafG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-information-watch-face-01.jpg" alt="A detailed informational watch face on the  Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oNNwKxJoYJXY33fs2JafG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In March 2024, we heard a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">report</a> that Samsung executives "enthusiastically" considered a plan to "bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches" for the first time since the Gear S in 2014.</p><p>One could argue that the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> a return to a squarish design. The 1.5-inch circular display sits atop a squircle slab of metal, which is certainly unique! But that space is entirely cosmetic, adding weight without adding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-has-one-path-to-success">utility of extra display space</a>.</p><p>If Samsung continues to emulate Apple&apos;s design decisions, switching fully to a squircle display would be the next step. That&apos;s not a guarantee, and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">long-time Android watch users would hate that switch</a>, but it&apos;s a possibility.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has an ultra-bright 1.5-inch display, revamped Exynos chip, turbo-powered health sensor LEDs for more accurate results, the same battery capacity as the long-lasting Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, and a much more rugged design than the standard Watch 7.

<ul><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, informed reporters that it will bring a generative AI overhaul to its AI assistant Bixby later "this year."</li><li>Roh added that the company sees such AI advancements as a "driver" for consumer interest and hopes to bring "convenience."</li><li>Google's Rick Osterloh was on stage during Unpacked to discuss the partnership with Samsung as both companies look to advance AI together.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following uncertain whispers, Samsung has come forward with information about how it will proceed with its AI assistant, Bixby.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/samsung-to-launch-upgraded-bixby-this-year-with-its-own-ai.html">CNBC</a> and confirmed that the company plans to overhaul Bixby "this year." Following Unpacked, Roh stated, "we’re going to advance Bixby with application of Gen AI technology." It seems that Samsung is interested in pushing the number of available generative AI features it provides and markets to consumers via its Galaxy devices.</p><p>Roh added, "as consumers use more AI capabilities, they can actually feel the convenience and benefits they bring. I believe strongly that these Galaxy AI and mobile AI are strong motivations and drivers for the purchase of new products."</p><p>However, despite Samsung&apos;s efforts to rapidly integrate more of its AI software into its devices, Galaxy products will still offer other options. Roh informed CNBC that Samsung will "maintain its strategy" of displaying multiple AI assistant options on its devices rather than just Galaxy AI.</p><p>Still, Roh did not divulge more about the specifics behind Bixby&apos;s upgrade slated for later in 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">Following the rumors in April</a>, we&apos;re we&apos;re finally getting confirmation of additional AI assistant upgrades. It was previously speculated that Samsung would move to bring Gen AI features to Bixby inspired by the work done at OpenAI for ChatGPT.</p><p>The rumor&apos;s source claimed that Samsung needed to "redefine" the purpose of Bixby due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">rise of LLMs</a> and generative AI features in a multitude of mediums.</p>
