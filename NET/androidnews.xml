<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Tensor G5 chip's design is reportedly finished and ready for manufacturing, using TSMC's latest 3nm process for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Google's move from Samsung to TSMC for the Tensor G5 signals a shift to fully custom chips.</li><li>Google switched from Samsung supposedly due to challenges with 3nm chip production, citing low yields and high power consumption.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to launch in 2025, but development is already well underway. A new report suggests that the core chipset, known as the Tensor G5, has completed its design phase (tape out) and is ready for manufacturing.</p><p>A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20240629700043-430501" target="_blank">report</a> from Taiwan hints at a big change in Google&apos;s approach to the Pixel 10&apos;s processor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Tensor-G5-Pixel-10-series-SoC-allegedly-tapes-out-on-TSMC-s-3-nm-node.855455.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). The upcoming Tensor G5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-testing-tsmc-made-tensor-chips-instead-of-samsung">is said to be manufactured based on TSMC&apos;s latest 3nm process</a>, aiming to boost both performance and battery life. This move marks a shift away from Google&apos;s previous partnership with Samsung, where they worked together on chip production and design, especially for the first Tensor chip.</p><p>The supposed completion of the Tensor G5 design reinforces Google&apos;s move towards a fully customized chip strategy. This exclusivity could mean future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> from the search giant will be able to offer unique features and address past issues. </p><p>Battery life and thermal management, which have been notable pain points for recent Google phones, might see major improvements as well.</p><p>Reportedly, Google chose to part ways with Samsung due to difficulties in producing 3nm chips at the South Korean tech giant&apos;s foundries. The main issues cited were low yields and high power consumption, which could lead to shortages and poor battery performance.</p><p>Google&apos;s Tensor G5 is a big deal because it could help the company build a complete package. It would be able to control everything from the chip and operating system to the apps and device itself, which gives it a leg up in the smartphone race. Plus, the Tensor G5 is set to turbocharge Google&apos;s AI efforts, making on-device AI even smarter and more immersive.</p><p>Up to now, all Tensor chips have been rooted in Samsung&apos;s Exynos line. Predictably, similar to Exynos, Tensor chips have wrestled with overheating problems that can sap battery life and hinder performance—something Google Pixels haven&apos;t always excelled at.</p><p>Completing the Tensor G5 design gives Google nearly a year to rigorously test its performance and efficiency, fine-tuning as needed along the way.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like Netflix is dropping its least expensive ad-free plan and pushing users to pay more than usual to access the platform without ads.</p><p>According to several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/">Reddit posts</a>, Netflix&apos;s $11.99 ad-free plan will be discontinued for customers on July 13. They must choose between a $6.99 plan that streams ads versus a $15.49 ad-free plan or the $22.99 ad-free 4K (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/netflix-killing-its-cheapest-plan/"> Android Police</a>).</p><p>The user&apos;s streaming is interrupted by a page that states their "basic plan has been discontinued" and that "you can change your plan at any time."</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription">Can't finish Netflix subscription </a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating">r/mildlyinfuriating</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Based on the Reddit complaints, it seems the streaming giant may first be testing out the updated offerings in the UK or Canada before expanding to other regions (including the U.S.).</p><p>One user on Reddit stated that Netflix wasn&apos;t allowing them to watch shows on their current ad-free plan without subscribing to the new one. "There&apos;s no option to continue watching without selecting a new plan," they said.</p><p>Some people feel that Netflix is simply not addressing the concerns of middle-class viewers. </p><p>"You&apos;re now either a poverty-class ad-supported viewer at $6 or a wealthy-class member at $16.50." While others have openly stated that they&apos;ve discontinued their subscriptions because they can&apos;t keep up with the rising costs. </p><p>This move doesn&apos;t come out of the blue, though.  Earlier this year, during its Q4 earnings call, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">publicly announced </a>that it had begun an effort to push customers to either more expensive or ad-supported plans. </p><p>"Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term," Netflix said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">statement</a>. </p><p>"On the advertiser side, we continue to improve the targeting and measurement we offer our customers."</p><p>While we can speculate why Netflix is trying to raise its prices, it appears that Netflix users are being pushed to pay extra for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/netflix-announces-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">ongoing projects</a>, like live programming and on-platform gaming. However, not all of those subscribers will be using those added services on the platform. </p><p>It is important to note that, despite people unsubscribing to the service, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnbc.com/2024/04/18/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2024.html">CNBC</a>, Netflix&apos;s memberships rose by 16% in the first quarter of 2024, reaching 269.6 million, and their net income was around $2.33 billion.</p>

<ul><li>Unnamed sources claim that Google is preparing to introduce a collection of features under the "Google AI" umbrella in the Pixel 9.</li><li>The collection is rumored to include features like "Add Me" for cameras, "Studio," and "Pixel screenshot," which performs like Microsoft's Recall.</li><li>Google recently emailed users about its early hardware event on August 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s AI has continued to advance and change, and now, a report suggests that the company is wrapping it all under a new name for the Pixel 9.</p><p>Google is preparing to debut a collection of "new and existing" features under the "Google AI" brand, sources tell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-ai-recall-pixel-9-3456399/">Android Authority</a>. There are supposedly three new key features: Add Me, Studio, and Pixel screenshots. Sources claim that "Add Me" is a camera feature that helps capture a group of people in a single shot.</p><p>More concrete information is unknown, however, there&apos;s speculation that it could take "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>" a step forward.</p><p>An early snapshot of Google AI highlighted the "Studio" tagline, which reads: "you imagine it. Pixel creates it." The running theory is that this feature could be an AI generator that lets users create images from prompts and even videos.</p><p>The publication states Google AI&apos;s Studio could be a previously discovered "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-generative-ai-stickers-3452501/">Creative Assistant</a>" app. It was speculated that this would be implemented into the screenshot editor so users could create useable stickers from their photos.</p>

<p>Sources state that "Pixel screenshots" are designed to be a user&apos;s "new home" for all images captured on their device. Enabling the feature will allow Google&apos;s AI to process your screenshot and create a tailored summary for that photo. Users can then return to it to ask questions.</p><p>A brief overview states Google will save screenshot information such as "metadata-like" weblinks, app names, and the date the photo was taken in the app. This feature functions similarly to Microsoft&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>," which debuted for Windows 11 PCs running Copilot Plus. Users were strongly against it due to the feature constantly capturing what they were doing on their computers, creating a severe breach of privacy.</p><p>The publication was informed that Google has taken steps to ensure user security by making Pixel screenshots an opt-in feature. Moreover, Google&apos;s version only activates the AI brain during a user&apos;s manual input: the screenshot command.</p><p>We&apos;re still curious about a few things, such as "Pixel screenshots" functionality in action. But, we&apos;re not far from knowing as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">started teasing</a> an early hardware event set for August 13. The event should hold insight into new Google products, Android software, and AI advancements. Other AI features on the Pixel 8 series are expected to continue on its successor, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Gemini&apos;s capabilities.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some Pixel owners are encountering a quirky bug with Spotify that makes their phones get stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>A recent software issue seems to be affecting Google Pixel 6, Pixel 7, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> devices, causing them to crash after running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a>. The exact software versions causing this issue are still unclear. This problem was first spotted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1dsqj1x/pixel_7_crashes_when_i_play_a_song_on_spotify/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, where users reported their Pixels crashing after playing Spotify (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-spotify-boot-loop-3456541/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>According to user reports, this issue started with the June Pixel Feature Drop. This new hiccup arrives just after another worrisome Pixel 6 glitch. A bug recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">turned some Pixel 6 devices into paperweights</a> after a routine factory reset.</p><p>Now, users are reporting a frustrating loop where their Pixels crash every time they try to play a song on Spotify. The phones don&apos;t completely shut down but show the error message "system UI is not responding." Occasionally, the crash wraps up by taking the device back to the lock screen.</p><p>Manually rebooting the device by long-pressing the power button stops the crashing loop.</p><p>Spotify has acknowledged the issue on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/App-crashing-on-Google-Pixel/idi-p/6170156" target="_blank">official forums</a>, confirming that it is aware and actively working on a fix. The company also noted that some users are experiencing long loading times when trying to launch the app.</p><p>"When hitting play on a song, it flickers between the lock screen and black before powering off," the forum post states.</p><p>The exact cause of this problem is still unclear. However, Android Authority suggests that Spotify&apos;s recent app update on July 2 might be to blame. To be fair, we have contacted Google for a statement, but the company was not immediately available to comment.</p><p>A solution is likely on the horizon, but in the meantime, Pixel users have discovered a few temporary fixes. Some suggest turning off Spotify notifications, while others recommend clearing the app&apos;s cache. Sadly, there&apos;s no universal remedy just yet.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into the Samsung Health app's latest version showed signs of a new feature that might let users share their health data with family.</li><li>Users can send a request to share health data, and parents must provide consent for their child to use the Health app to collect and display their data.</li><li>Speculation suggests this could hit the Galaxy Watch 7, which had its entire spec sheet leaked yesterday (July 1) along with the Watch Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Samsung is developing a new family-oriented health feature for its Galaxy Watch portfolio analytic overviews.</p><p>An APK deep dive by X tipster Assemble Debug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-family-health-tracking-apk-teardown-3455990/">Android Authority</a> held all the details, showcasing Samsung&apos;s development of "family health data." While most functionality remained hidden, some basic information, like the feature&apos;s uses, was obtained. An "About" page states the feature lets you "track everyone&apos;s progress" after creating a family group through your Samsung account.</p><p>Through a new "Share with someone" screen, users will likely see a list of available users they can decide to show their health analytics.</p><p>Users in the group can alter how much data they&apos;d like to share or keep private. Additionally, the early code teases users will be able to "preview" what they will share before doing so. Parents accessing their child&apos;s health data need to provide consent before the Health app can display it.</p><p>The publication surfaced a quick example of how this could look like, which involved a request approval pop-up. After accepting, the app notified them that their child&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch</a> must be paired with a phone holding their Samsung account credentials.</p><p>The early informational page detailed that Samsung will run security checks of you and your family&apos;s health data "periodically." Moreover, the Health app inactivity for 90 days will result in the deletion of your data.</p>

<p>A focused look at what sort of health data users <em>could </em>share with each other wasn&apos;t discovered. However, we may be able to share each other&apos;s fitness data, such as steps, calories burned, and perhaps even sleep information. We&apos;ll have to wait and see where Samsung takes this.</p><p>There is speculation that this feature could debut on the Galaxy Watch 7 before others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">specification sheet</a> for Samsung&apos;s upcoming wearables in France surfaced and told us all we needed to know. The Watch Ultra might debut with a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a 590mAh battery and 32GB of storage for an estimated $750. The smaller Watch 7 could feature a 40mm variant and a 44mm size with slightly smaller 300mAh and 425mAh capacity batteries.</p><p>Both watches were rumored to launch with similar sensors, such as BioActive, heart rate, temperature, Gyroscope, and geomagnetic.</p><p>The good news is we aren&apos;t far from Samsung&apos;s official say-so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">as it confirmed</a> the next Unpacked event for July 10. Joining that announcement was the start of its reserve program in which users can snag $50.</p>

<p>With Google continuing to develop its Android software and new products side-by-side, a discovery suggests the Pixel 9 Pro Fold could benefit.</p><p>Android deep diver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1807843011692265500">Mishaal Rahman</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-changes-3456265/">Android Authority</a>) discovered some additions in the software&apos;s code that point toward enhancing its foldable&apos;s multitasking. A new configuration was added in March during Android 14 QPR2, which involved support for a left-right split for apps. Rahman states this would be regarded as "portrait foldables."</p><p>However, another look at Google&apos;s new support for it in Android suggests it intends for this to be used on the next Fold. Rahman adds that joining the left-right split configuration is a "pixel_fold2" string.</p><p>The left-right app split lets users place two apps side-by-side when holding their device in portrait mode instead of turning horizontally. Moreover, Rahman states that this could pair well with Android 15&apos;s support for saving split-screen configurations for later use on the home screen.</p><p>However, this is likely done intentionally as the company is seemingly changing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s</a> screen resolution. Rahman stumbled across the resolution specification for this configuration, which is 2076x2152. The resolution of the inner display for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">original Pixel Fold</a> is 2208x1840.</p>

<p>With so much involving the next Pixel Fold&apos;s screen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-to-opt-for-8-dot-2-inch-foldable-screen">previous leaks</a> about Google potentially boosting its displays seem relevant. A tipster on X stated the company could go bigger with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold by delivering a 6.29-inch cover screen. The device&apos;s inner display could jump to 8.02 inches instead of 7.6 inches.</p><p>Elsewhere, a set of Pixel 9 Pro Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-renders">renders leaked</a>, showcasing the potential for quite a unique camera array design. The photos suggest Google could move away from that pill-shaped camera visor to a squared housing with (possibly) three lenses. Additionally, the rumored dimensions create the image of a taller and narrower Fold when compared to last year&apos;s version.</p><p>Interestingly, we might not be that far away from Google&apos;s reveal as the company started teasing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">extremely early August event</a>. According to its emails, the next Made by Google event is looking at an August 13 date for AI information, Android, and its next wave of in-house products. This will likely include the next Pixel Fold alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">the Pixel 9 series</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I conducted an experiment with the Find My Device network and the latest compatible Bluetooth trackers. If you haven&apos;t already read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">that week&apos;s column</a>, here&apos;s a quick summary:</p><p>After setting them up, I marked several trackers as lost and handed them out to my friends. They were instructed to move around the entire city and not tell me about their whereabouts. The idea was that I would find them by marking my trackers as lost by relying on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network.</p><p>This gave me the perfect opportunity to test the new network as well as the new compatible trackers in a controlled environment. I could even confirm the location tracking accuracy, or at least that&apos;s what I had hoped. Alas, things did not go as I had predicted.</p>
<p>It took a while for Google to alert nearby devices about the lost trackers. I didn&apos;t hear anything back from the Find My Device network for weeks. And it&apos;s not like people did not find the lost trackers in that time period. My friends shared screenshots confirming that they were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unwanted-tracking-notifications-rolling-out-ios-android">alerted of unknown trackers "following" them</a> on both Android and iOS devices, the latter being a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Here&apos;s what the notification looks like for iOS users when there&apos;s an unknown Google Find My Device compatible tracker nearby:</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2217px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.17%;"><img id="dQoUWK29PF2u42AQfAjeRk" name="find-my-device-ios-1.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device alerts on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQoUWK29PF2u42AQfAjeRk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2217" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:91.28%;"><img id="Gp3V3fLa9WJC6QweAWQmdk" name="find-my-device-ios-2.jpeg" alt="Google Find My Device alerts on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gp3V3fLa9WJC6QweAWQmdk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>And here&apos;s how Android users would be alerted of lost or unknown Find My Device items:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1722px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.92%;"><img id="VekTpkMcsQC4apw3tuvM6A" name="find-my-device-Android-1.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device alerts for various trackers on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VekTpkMcsQC4apw3tuvM6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1722" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once notified of their existence, individuals who find lost or unknown trackers are given several options. You can contact the owner of the device in the manner they specified or ring the device to locate its position exactly. Some of the options depend on whether the device is lost or just unknown.</p><p>In my test, however, the proximity that my friends were required to be in to detect the lost items was too close. So, if I had lost my devices in real life, the chances of strangers coming close enough to be able to detect or ring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a> through their phone&apos;s alert would be very slim.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2106px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="QbKGrA76HVqgd3jLVRx85F" name="lost-chipolo-bluetooth-tracker-on-google-find-my-device-app-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Notification for lost Chipolo Bluetooth tracker on Google Find My Device app on Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbKGrA76HVqgd3jLVRx85F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2106" height="1184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of my biggest issues with the current system is that you cannot actually see your lost device on the Find My Device map, even if it has been found by someone. Google could&apos;ve made this an anonymous contribution, but it didn&apos;t. In contrast, you can choose to opt-out completely or contribute only in specific areas based on your network preferences.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>That's the farthest possible thing from being foolproof.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In conclusion, you need to rely on the kindheartedness of some random person to get your stuff back. That&apos;s the farthest possible thing from being foolproof.</p><p>On top of that, the person who finds the lost device is informed that the owner of the device can see your location when, in actuality, they can&apos;t. At least, that wasn&apos;t the case in my testing. Imagine if you come across a random notification telling you that you&apos;re being tracked by some strange tracker. Who would contact the owner, especially if they didn&apos;t mark it as lost? I know I&apos;d be hella creeped out.</p><p>It&apos;s a pretty ironic situation because that notification could scare people off instead of encouraging them to pick up the lost item and contact the owner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA" name="pebblebee-clip-google-find-my-device-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip Bluetooth tracker compatible with Google Find My Device on a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google notified me well after my friends were alerted about my lost devices. I tried to zone in on the exact location of my lost devices, but the map wouldn&apos;t load, and all I got was zilch.</p><p>There&apos;s a very simple way to fix this, as I mentioned earlier. Google shouldn&apos;t be giving us so many choices. Instead, it should reassure users that their contributions are completely anonymous and alert owners of lost possessions as soon as they are discovered on the network.</p><p>Google reached out to me recently to address my experience with the network. I was informed that it is aware of the speed and accuracy errors and that it is working on improving both factors in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We are actively working to roll out enhancements to how the Find My Device network operates that will improve the speed and ability of locating lost items over the coming weeks. Devices are continuing to join the new Find My Device network, and we expect the network to grow, which will also help improve lost device findability. We encourage Bluetooth tag owners to change their Find My Device network setting to “With network in all areas” to help improve the network’s ability to find their lost items in lower-traffic areas.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This gives me reassurance that all hope isn&apos;t lost and that Google can make the Find My Device network what we all dreamed of. With the right updates and with time, as more devices join in, we can see the network reach its maximum potential.</p><p>As more and more devices join the network, it is essential that everyone participates wholeheartedly, choosing to contribute as much as possible by selecting the "With network in all areas" option within the Find My Device app. More devices will widen the web and therefore increase the probability of lost devices getting discovered on it.</p><p>Google is already rolling out changes to improve and fix some of the biggest issues with its crowdfunded network. I&apos;m going to wait with bated breath to see whether they make the right moves and bring about the changes needed for the Find My Device network to go head-to-head with Apple&apos;s Find My network.</p>

<p>A bunch of new Samsung devices are set to be unveiled on July 10th, but if you reserve your place in line today, you'll receive an exclusive $50 credit. You'll also be eligible to receive up to $1,500 of trade-in credit once the mystery devices go live, <em>and </em>you'll be entered into a sweepstakes to win an additional $5,000 of Samsung credit. </p>
<p>There's no obligation to buy, no payment required today, and you only need to provide your name and email address. Just keep in mind that the offer expires once Samsung Unpacked starts on July 10th, so don't wait too long. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w " target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="78a37c78-9b80-4241-bf28-739453184fd4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more" data-dimension48="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>So what new devices do we expect to see during Samsung Unpacked on July 10th? Well, nothing has been confirmed, but a large number of leaks and rumors have suggested that we might get a first look at the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a> foldable phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 series</a>, and, if we&apos;re lucky, the highly-anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>. </p><p>Filling out the form above will give you $50 to apply to any of the aforementioned Galaxy devices, assuming we&apos;re correct about the stuff that&apos;s revealed. You&apos;ll obviously lose the credit if you decide not to preorder after the event, but there&apos;s no real pressure from Samsung beyond that. </p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome for Android might soon have a useful new feature for its users.</li><li>It is essentially the already available Read Aloud or Listen to the Article feature but for offline mode.</li><li>The feature is available through a flag on Chrome for now, and could soon roll out officially.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome for Android is preparing for an extension to the Read Aloud feature, which should now work online for Android phones.</p><p>As first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-on-android-to-support-background-playback-for-read-aloud/">MSPowerUser</a> the feature, currently hidden behind a flag for Chrome on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, will allow users to read articles even when they are offline. Read Aloud has been on Chrome&apos;s desktop and web version for a while. It converts any text on the web page to speech to help users listen to the articles. The same feature has also been used for the Google Search app — for Android and iOS devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:278px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:176.98%;"><img id="j9SasbR7c2FB477dyWK46c" name="google-chrome-read-aloud-offline.jpg" alt="Google Chrome Read Aloud offline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j9SasbR7c2FB477dyWK46c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="278" height="492" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MSPowerUser)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other flag, dubbed Read Aloud Background Playback, is yet another crucial extension for Google Chrome as it allows Read Aloud to work even when users are offline. </p><p>Google Chrome has this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-canary-android-read-aloud-history-spotted">read-aloud feature</a> under a flag that allows users to listen to articles stored in Reading Mode, which has also been available on Chromebooks. Alternatively, users can select any text on the web page and use the mouse&apos;s second click to open speech services, which starts reading text aloud.</p><p>As MSPowerUser notes for Chrome on desktops, the read-aloud feature tends to work even when the tab is minimized; however, it immediately stops when another tab is opened.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="pLg3Z4x7ftz8Wzf5r825gC" name="google-chrome-listen-to-article-feature.jpg" alt="Google Chrome Listen to Article feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pLg3Z4x7ftz8Wzf5r825gC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, users on Google Chrome on Android have access to the Read Aloud feature by visiting a page—tapping the three-dot menu—and selecting the “Listen to article” feature. This opens up a mini-player and starts reading the showcased page. Users further have playback controls like a ten-second rewind and forward and also the ability to adjust the playback speed.</p><p>However, that’s been the case when Chrome on Android is connected online, and the respective tab needs to be active. The new flag under works, however, eliminates the need for it, which is handy. As the new feature is currently tucked away under a flag, we expect it to soon be official through a Chrome app update in the coming weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Google Keep gains multi-account support when the app is used in split mode on foldables and large-screen Android devices.</li><li>The feature follows the multi-instance support that Google rolled out for bigger Android devices last year.</li><li>The feature is being rolled out with Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing the ability to create two Google Keep notes side-by-side on large-screen Android devices, the search giant announced another nifty feature for the note-taking app.</p><p>People utilizing the Google Keep app on large Android devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> can now use multiple accounts side-by-side with the note-taking app. Imagine having two Google accounts and simultaneously having two different Google Keep accounts linked to them, and you might probably use them for different purposes. The new update allows users to view their accounts on a large Android screen and also works around them.</p>
<p>"Having two windows open side-by-side enables better insight into your notes and gives you more ways to work with, display, and organize your content across multiple accounts, " Google notes in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/release-notes-06-28-2024.html">accompanying Workspace post</a>.</p><p>The shared gif in the post further demonstrates how easy it is to use multiple accounts on Google Keep when projected in the multi-window mode. Users can change their accounts in the Keep app by hitting their profile picture, similar to changing accounts in the Gmail app or any other Google app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="Rk9tJqw2qB2oM3EmBfuTSi" name="google-keep-multi-account-foldables.gif" alt="Google Keep multi-account support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rk9tJqw2qB2oM3EmBfuTSi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new feature is a nifty addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-side-by-side-notes-on-android-tablets-foldables">previous multi-instance</a> support for Google Keep that rolled out last year for large-screen Android devices. Google says the new productivity update is rolling out to Rapid Release and Scheduled Release domains. It will be available for all Google Workspace customers, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and consumers who use their personal Google accounts.</p><p>The new feature comes in handy and goes hand-in-hand with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-to-gain-window-resize-feature-soon">recent window resize feature</a>, which was spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-keep">Google Keep</a> app. The ability to resize windows on the note-taking app has been the most requested feature from users, and it was found testing early last month hidden under a flag. Previously, the ability to resize the window was available for the Google Calendar app.</p>
