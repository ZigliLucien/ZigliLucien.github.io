A lot of that is down to the hardware; the Open has a gorgeous design, smooth hinge with no visible crease, excellent internal hardware, a larger battery than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, 67W charging, and terrific cameras.</p><p>While there were software issues out of the box, these have been addressed with updates. With the Open gaining decent momentum, it&apos;s now time to take a look at what the Open 2 could bring to the table once it launches later this year. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-design"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK" name="oneplus-open-35.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5YPXRoyAY3swpXj75cfitK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus designed the Open in collaboration with OPPO, and that&apos;s immediately evident when viewing the device next to the Find N2. In fact, the Find N3 is identical to the Open, with the only difference being that it is limited to China, whereas the Open is sold in global markets. </p><p>As such, it is unlikely we&apos;ll see any major design change with the Open 2. While OPPO likes to switch up the design of its Find X devices — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> has a distinct design that stands out — it has maintained the same styling to all of its foldables, and that isn&apos;t likely to change. </p><p>What could be different is a new hinge that is even lighter than the previous generation. Honor has the distinction of the thinnest foldable in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and as this is a key area of contention between all the Chinese manufacturers, it is entirely likely the Open 2 will feature a redesigned hinge. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has an outstanding hardware package, and that is set to continue with the Open 2. The upcoming foldable will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it should retain the same 67W charging tech. </p><p>OnePlus isn&apos;t messing with battery tech this year, and while it has 150W charging available, it isn&apos;t usable in North America, so for devices that are launching globally, it is limiting the charging potential to 100W or 67W. Considering the limited room on a foldable, I don&apos;t see any changes in this area. </p><p>Having said that, the Open 2 is likely to include a larger battery that lasts noticeably longer. There hasn&apos;t been any confirmation about the battery size, but OnePlus is said to offer up to a 5000mAh battery on the foldable. </p><p>The rest of the hardware is likely to be unchanged, but I&apos;ll update this post once we have credible details. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-cameras"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MFbv8pqxhAinWWcVKYewKD" name="oneplus-open-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFbv8pqxhAinWWcVKYewKD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus did all the right things when it comes to the Open cameras, with the foldable offering a fabulous set of lenses at the back. With 2024 phones pushing the boundaries of camera tech — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, Find X7 Ultra, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> all have sizeable gains — the Open 2 should have some of these gains baked in. </p><p>Then again, considering the launch window of the Open 2, it could be a while before we know what camera hardware the device is packing to any reasonable degree. What you need to know at this point is that the cameras should be on the same level as the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a terrific starting point. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-release-date"><span>OnePlus Open 2: Release date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GkuiDi9EL2qQjKaytP7bEC" name="oneplus-open-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GkuiDi9EL2qQjKaytP7bEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is targeting the same launch window as last year, but it is moving things up a little, so get ready to see the Open 2 sometime before the month of October. </p><p>An earlier launch positions the Open 2 against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and with OnePlus following a similar stance with the OnePlus 12 at the start of the year, the Open 2 should debut before the end of Q3 2024. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-2-what-i-want-to-see"><span>OnePlus Open 2: What I want to see</span></h2>
<h2 id="oneplus-needs-to-add-wireless-charging-2">OnePlus needs to add wireless charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM" name="oneplus-open-39.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fy7EdSSW3TzME3zjwU23HM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know who signed off on not including wireless charging on the OnePlus Open, but it is the biggest limitation on the device. Sure, the phone was designed in conjunction with OPPO, and the Chinese manufacturer doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging on its own devices — so you don&apos;t get one here.</p><p>However, the Open is sold in a lot of global markets, and with OnePlus positioning it as the ideal alternative to Samsung in North America, it needed to nail the table stakes features. While the battery life itself is much better than Samsung&apos;s foldables, the fact that it is limited to wired charging — no matter how fast — makes it a little less enticing.</p><p>With the Open 2, OnePlus has to rectify this particular issue and offer wireless charging out of the box. While it&apos;s okay for a device like the OnePlus 11 to miss out on it, the Open costs nearly thrice as much at $1,699, and not having the ability to charge wirelessly is a shortsighted move.</p>
<h2 id="polished-software-out-of-the-box-2">Polished software out of the box</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF" name="oneplus-open-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwHZfFvCTHoKYvZ8dSYcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a regular complaint with all OnePlus phones, but I want to see better software out of the box with the Open 2, not a few months down the line. Yes, the ColorOS integration made things that much more difficult, but it&apos;s been two years now, and that cannot be the excuse to deliver shoddy software on every new phone.</p><p>OnePlus has shown that it can deliver; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> was devoid of any major bugs, and it was optimized for the hardware. I know achieving the same on a foldable is twice as hard as there are two screens to deal with and numerous scaling issues, but the Open 2 has to do better. And while we&apos;re at it, can I get a 5x5 grid? I still don&apos;t understand why that isn&apos;t available on the Open.</p>
<h2 id="ipx8-water-resistance-2">IPX8 water resistance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C" name="oneplus-open-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8WKGQq2BDu7mHJeTEyR4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Open has IPX4 water resistance, and that means that it can withstand an occasional splash of water. OnePlus says that the hinge automatically ejects any dust that manages to get in, and even though it isn&apos;t tested, it should do a decent job with any dust ingress as well.</p><p>That said, I&apos;d like to see IPX8 water resistance on the Open 2. That would make the foldable that much more resilient to the elements, and bring it to parity with Samsung&apos;s foldables.</p>
<h2 id="stylus-integration-would-be-nice-to-have-2">Stylus integration would be nice to have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is another one of those features that feels motivated by OPPO. As the brand doesn&apos;t pay particular attention to global markets, adding stylus integration wasn&apos;t a priority, and the Open misses out on it. I&apos;m not saying the foldable should have come with a stylus in the box — even Samsung isn&apos;t that generous — but the ability to use a stylus with the inner screen makes the foldable that much more useful.</p><p>Even if OnePlus decides it doesn&apos;t want to bother making its own stylus, there are plenty of aftermarket styli that do a great job with note-taking and doodling. I have a half-dozen styli in the house, and while I don&apos;t really use them as much as I should, having the option to do so on the Open 2 would go a long way.</p>

<hr>
<p>There was a bittersweet feeling for fans of Google&apos;s Nest Hub lineup when it unveiled the Google Pixel Tablet because it seemed to doom the future of the company&apos;s dedicated smart displays. However, there are now indications that the five-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> might finally receive a much-needed refresh. While the current Nest Hub Max is still a solid smart home controller despite being released first in 2019, there are a few things about the display that make it feel ancient.</p><p>In version 3.16 of the Google Home app, references to a new and unreleased Nest Hub Max model were uncovered in an APK teardown by the team at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/23/new-nest-audio-hub-max-spotted/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The report says that the unknown device is clearly listed as a Nest Hub Max in code for the Google Home app, leaving little room for different interpretations. It also notes that this new device won&apos;t be powered by Android, and will instead use the same Fuchsia OS that powers current Nest Hub displays.</p><p>This all but confirms that a potential next-generation Nest Hub Max will still keep its smart display identity and not follow in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>&apos;s footsteps. That device runs Android but also features a smart display mode that makes it comparable in functionality to Nest Hub devices. Google could have easily pivoted its strategy with a subsequent Nest Hub Max, ditching Fuchsia for its new Android smart display mode.</p><p>That said, it certainly looks like Google is planning to freshen up its smart home offerings this year. The same report reveals that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> product might be on the way, while a prior report shared that Google is likely planning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">launch a new Chromecast with Google TV 4K</a>. </p><p>We don&apos;t know when (or if) this upgraded Nest Hub Max might launch. Still, let&apos;s take a look at why the smart display still has a place in Google&apos;s 2024 product lineup and what we want to see.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-pixel-tablet-and-nest-hub-max-need-to-coexist-2">Why the Pixel Tablet and Nest Hub Max need to coexist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">compare the Pixel Tablet and the Nest Hub Max</a>, it might be easy to declare the Pixel Tablet as the clear winner at first glance. However, in reality, it&apos;s much more complicated than that. The obvious difference between these two devices is the price: the Pixel Tablet starts at $500, while the Nest Hub Max costs $230. Both devices are frequently available at a discount, but the Nest Hub Max can be bought for under $200 easily during deals holidays like Black Friday. </p><p>So, the Pixel Tablet is not a one-size-fits-all solution for your smart home needs simply because it costs double the price of the Nest Hub Max. It&apos;s true that the Pixel Tablet is, well, a tablet — and that makes it a great value for people who are in the market for <em>both</em> an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> <em>and</em> a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart display</a>. I was in the market for something like a Pixel Tablet or a Nest Hub Max late last year, but when it came down to it, I ended up buying the latter because I simply didn&apos;t need a tablet. </p><p>The Pixel Tablet has clear versatility benefits, but it isn&apos;t the best for every situation. For starters, the included speaker docking station generally doesn&apos;t sound as good or as loud as the Nest Hub Max. Additionally, the Pixel Tablet doesn&apos;t include a Thread radio, so you can forget setting up your Nest Audio hardware as the device&apos;s default speaker outputs. If you need a smart home controller first and foremost, the five-year-old Nest Hub Max is still the cream of the crop. </p>
<h2 id="what-i-want-to-see-in-a-nest-hub-max-refresh-2">What I want to see in a Nest Hub Max refresh</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dbdsrJHiobNCod6MigjEqP" name="Nest-Hub-Max-1.jpg" alt="The Nest Hub Max sitting on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbdsrJHiobNCod6MigjEqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not to say that the current Nest Hub Max isn&apos;t desperately in need of a refresh. The display is perhaps the biggest thing in need of an upgrade, especially when compared to the Pixel Tablet. The white bezels of the Nest Hub Max display are massive and look incredibly outdated compared to the slimmer bezels on the Pixel Tablet. </p><p>The Nest Hub Max can also feel slow at times and doesn&apos;t respond to requests perfectly in others. A hardware upgrade and software improvements would be greatly appreciated by Nest Hub Max owners, and these might prepare the Nest Hub Max to move away from Google Assistant. Google appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">shifting away from Assistant and moving to Gemini</a>, and new internal components might help Gemini power a new smart display. </p><p>Google will likely take notes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">second-generation Nest Hub</a>, which added a new sensor for tracking sleep quality. This probably doesn&apos;t matter as much on the Max because it is better suited for countertop use, but it seems like an easy inclusion.</p><p>We hope that pricing for a second-gen Nest Hub Max will remain competitive and ideally stay at $230. If there&apos;s a true and meaningful overhaul, a price of around $250 is still justifiable, but a price bump that nears $300 would overlap with the Pixel Tablet. </p>

<p>With rumors swirling about various unreleased Google hardware products, all eyes are on Google I/O, as we expect to see at least one of them at the developer-focused event. The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-images-show-mint-and-bay-colors">Pixel 8a</a> smartphone looks to be the most likely product to launch at I/O, but it&apos;s also possible Google surprises us with something like a Chromecast or Nest device. Even if no smart home hardware products debut, Google might discuss its software strategy at I/O instead. Either way, if you&apos;re interested in Google&apos;s smart home efforts, it&apos;s worth keeping tabs on I/O and our coverage of the mid-May event.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio is a powerhouse when it comes to the budget segment, and the brand continues to roll out options that excel at value. The JH5 illustrates this quite well; the IEMs have a hybrid driver that sees a dynamic driver paired with four balanced armature drivers, and it has a new design that looks modern.</p><p>Best of all, the JH5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-JadeAudio-JH5-Detachable-Audiophile/dp/B0CMHB2BQ1">costs just $79 on Amazon</a>, making it an unbelievable value. Like the JD3 and JD7, the JH5 is branded under the Jade Audio label, but it stands out quite a bit from the brand&apos;s other offerings. On that note, Fiio sells the JH5 in two options: black and silver. The silver version in particular looks terrific, and it doesn&apos;t look like a budget product in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cJZehoRcZDtGQjRUTRBAjL" name="fiio-jh5-11.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJZehoRcZDtGQjRUTRBAjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of that has to do with the new design. The JH5 has a 3D-printed acrylic shell, and it has a clear design that lets you view all the parts housed underneath. You can make out the dynamic drivers, the four BA drivers, and even the individual driver chambers that ensure there&apos;s no crossover between frequencies. I&apos;m a big fan of see-through designs, and this is what I wanted Nothing to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a> — actually show off the hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SF7ZipmZdqoUJVVYkrWKMN" name="fiio-jh5-19.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SF7ZipmZdqoUJVVYkrWKMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 fits comfortably thanks to the contoured shell design, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in that area. It doesn&apos;t exert too much pressure on the ear canal, and the shells are lightweight enough that you don&apos;t notice any fatigue with extended use. The vent at the back has a grille, and on the whole, the IEMs are great for casual listening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aPp9HfSjHwC8qXBTRiGobL" name="fiio-jh5-14.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPp9HfSjHwC8qXBTRiGobL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio went with a faceplate featuring a zinc alloy, and it looks modern. The design blends seamlessly with the shell, and again, it conveys a sense of elegance that makes the JH5 look much more premium than its price tag suggests. That said, the glossy texture is prone to smudging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f7us4jxBFfnG8nw5PeUXCL" name="fiio-jh5-10.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7us4jxBFfnG8nw5PeUXCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Build quality is outstanding, and in the four months I used the JH5, I didn&apos;t see any problems with the fit and finish of the product. The bundled silver-plated cable is of a good quality as well, and it has standard 2-pin connectors; I liked the cable so much that I used it with a half-dozen IEMs. It has a 3.5mm connector with an angled design, and while a 4.4mm balanced port would have been ideal, the single-ended jack is good enough.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v56ygA5ZKLw2Q6LCDSJSCN" name="fiio-jh5-18.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v56ygA5ZKLw2Q6LCDSJSCN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also get a good selection of silicone ear tips bundled in the package, but what I like the most is the HB11 storage case. The slide-out case offers excellent protection, and it has a slotted design that lets you stack it with other cases — or even mount Lego minifigs. While I like the design of the case, it isn&apos;t exactly portable, and is considerably larger than most IEM cases you get in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="K392ZiacimYDEGsGNnuSnK" name="fiio-jh5-2.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K392ZiacimYDEGsGNnuSnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a sensitivity of 112dB and 13Ω, the JH5 can be easily driven by any source. But as always, you&apos;ll make the most out of the drivers by pairing the buds with a good portable source; a dongle DAC like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13</a> makes a big difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5idmYBobTz8zS3dRxGuQ5L" name="fiio-jh5-5.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5idmYBobTz8zS3dRxGuQ5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 retains Fiio&apos;s characteristic sound, but you get much better vibrancy, particularly in the low-end. Bass notes have a satisfying rumble and texture, and the sub-bass has good definition that makes listening to bass-focused tunes highly enjoyable. Mids are similarly detailed, and while the vocal presentation isn&apos;t as natural as Fiio&apos;s other hybrid driver designs, it is clear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LVrbUEikPgoUVPFj4R3QMM" name="fiio-jh5-4.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVrbUEikPgoUVPFj4R3QMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Treble is decent in its own right, but it has limited extension. You don&apos;t get any sibilance though, and given the tweaks to the tuning, it&apos;s clear that Fiio designed the JH5 for casual listening sessions and not necessarily as a technical set.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9mSfyRgUPsRgp82QqQdArL" name="fiio-jh5-13.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mSfyRgUPsRgp82QqQdArL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, there is a lot to like with the JH5. The design gives the IEMs a distinct presence, and while the case is just too big, I like the quirkiness on offer. The IEMs have excellent isolation in addition to a comfortable fit, and the cable is one of the better options in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dethwncB39q7BqAmYfWPBM" name="fiio-jh5-9.jpg" alt="Fiio JH5 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dethwncB39q7BqAmYfWPBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The JH5 doesn&apos;t have the same technical prowess as Fiio&apos;s other hybrid drivers, but the sound is highly enjoyable, and the exuberant bass combined with vibrant mids make it fun to use with a lot of genres. Ultimately, it&apos;s the value that makes the JH5 such a good choice — you&apos;re getting a standout sound along with an elegant design and a decent amount of accessories.</p>

<ul><li>In an expansive update, Meta rolled out multimodal AI support and video call capabilities to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses users. Multimodal AI is in beta for all U.S. and Canadian users, while video call support is rolling out gradually.</li><li>Earlier, Meta quietly added Apple Music as a supported service in the Meta View app, allowing for hands-free control.</li><li>Meta is also adding a new frame option called Skyler and a low-bridge option for Headliner frames.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta spent the last week reminding everyone in the tech industry that it is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to AI. The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">launched a new Llama 3 AI model</a> and integrated Meta AI into its core apps. Now, the Meta AI experience on its Ray-Ban smart glasses is getting upgraded to multimodal AI, putting it in the same league as new AI hardware products like the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1. </p><p>The company explained the updates in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-styles-and-meta-ai-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, which also include support for POV-style video calling and two new frame styles. Separately, Meta quietly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/ray-ban-meta/apple-music-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/" target="_blank">added Apple Music support</a> in the Meta View app, enabling hands-free music control and playback. </p><p>The company began testing multimodal AI with the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses a few months ago, combining the glasses&apos; camera with Meta AI. The term "multimodal" means that you can interact with Meta AI through different modes. The glasses first shipped with voice control, which was one mode, but the multimodal upgrade adds the camera as another mode by which you can interact with Meta AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</p><p>As an example, Meta said that you can ask your smart glasses to translate items on a menu using your voice, the camera, and Meta AI. </p>
<p>Multimodal AI isn&apos;t perfect, but it may be better than other wearable implementations of the technology, like the Humane AI Pin. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> are paired with a smartphone, users get lower latency and quicker response times. However, the small camera and a lack of zoom can be limiting in some cases. This feature is rolling out to everyone in the U.S. and Canada but is still a beta feature. </p>

<p>Following the update, the camera on your smart glasses can also be used as a video feed for video calls. In an Instagram post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the functionality:</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6G5cGlrq4V/" target="_blank">A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>Previously, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses could be used for livestreaming, but now video calls are supported too. </p><p>On the hardware side of things, Meta is offering two new frame options. One of them is called Skyler, and Meta describes these as having "a cat eye design inspired by an era of iconic jet-set style, designed to suit smaller faces." The other is a low-bridge option for the existing Headliner frames, which the company says is best suited for people who have glasses slide down the bridge of their nose frequently. </p>

<p>Aside from the new colorways and frames, the under-the-hood hardware is unchanged. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses still retail for $300 but have gained a few big new features since their initial launch.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 may not look like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but its design is still nice to look at. It hasn&apos;t changed much from the A34, which has a flat back and three camera rings at the top left.

With the camera bump in the center, some may even say it looks like a robot looking at you. The NFC coil also surrounds the camera with three LED bars to give it that unique design.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 is almost the same size as its predecessor, measuring 161.7 x 78 x 8.2 mm, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a34-launch">Galaxy A34</a> measures 161.3 x 78.1 x 8.2mm. The change is small and might even be noticed, but the numbers are not identical. These measurements differ slightly from the Nothing Phone 2a, which only trails slightly behind. </p><p>The Galaxy A35 does fall a little short with a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it one millimeter smaller than the competition. The Samsung Galaxy A35 is available in different colors, such as Lilac, Ice Blue, and Navy, although in some countries, it&apos;s only available in black.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a features a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel and a 120Hz refresh rate with HDR10 support, while the Galaxy A35&apos;s panel can decode HDR10 and HDR10+. This means that apps like Netflix won&apos;t natively deliver HDR content on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a comes in only two colors: black and white. At least one additional color would have been nicer, but the subway-inspired design makes up for the lack of options. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 and A34 have little difference in design, so it&apos;s easy to confuse the two models when they&apos;re face down. The Nothing Phone 2a, on the other hand, has a design that is unique to it, even among other Nothing phones. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9" name="samsung galaxy a35 gaming.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy A35 gaming" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86GdhXXZUA8bEU3A3EZNm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy A35 has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380</a> 5G chipset, the same one the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Galaxy A54</a> had when it was launched last year. However, this new chipset is an upgrade since the A34 came with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-1080-launch">Dimensity 1080</a>. You won&apos;t get outstanding performance with the Exynos, but you can count on decent performance for day-to-day usage.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s chipset is a customized variation of the Mediateck Dimensity 7200, the 7200 Pro. It&apos;s not as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>&apos;s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, but it&apos;s enough for casual gaming. </p><p>Both phones come with 8GB and 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage, but the Galaxy A35 is offered with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage option. You can get expandable storage on the Galaxy A35 but not the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35&apos;s screen brightness is very similar to that of the A34, with a maximum brightness of 440 nits with the manual slider and as high as 1,000 nits in auto mode. With the Nothing Phone 2a, the brightness can go over 660 nits with the manual slider and nearly 1,300 nits in auto mode.</p><p>Then there is battery life; both phones have a 5,000mAh battery, giving you up to two days of usage. There is a difference in wired charging: the Galaxy A35 only supports 25W, while the Nothing Phone 2a comes with 45W. You&apos;ll need to buy the charger for both phones since neither model has one in the box. You can get wireless charging with the A35 but not with the Phone 2a.</p><p>When it comes to Wi-Fi, you get an improved Wi-Fi 6 connectivity over the previous Galaxy model, but the Nothing Phone 2a matches it. The 2a also matches the Bluetooth 5.3.  </p><p>Both models share different specs, but the Nothing Phone 2a has a longer battery life and is a little brighter than the Galaxy A35.</p>

<p>Both phones run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with their respective OS versions. The Galaxy A35 runs on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a>, while the Nothing Phone 2a comes with Nothing OS 2.5. Unlike Samsung, the Phone 2a doesn&apos;t come with bloatware; it&apos;s clean. </p><p>The Phone 2a has a dot aesthetic, and you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up more space on your home screen. You can also choose how you want your apps folder to look, with a few styles to choose from and try the AI wallpaper generator. You also get to choose your lock screen widgets, and you can choose from device controls to apps.</p><p>While you can&apos;t change the app folder&apos;s appearance on the Galaxy A35, you can edit the lock screen. You can change the fonts, font color, and font style. Samsung also lets you add widgets and change the shortcuts below. You also have extra customization options, such as adding a frame to selected wallpapers. You can&apos;t create AI-generated wallpapers, so the Phone 2a one-ups Samsung on this one.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s main camera is kind of a big deal with its 50MP Samsung GN9 sensor with OIS and the Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens, which is the same one you can find on the Phone 2. Unfortunately, you don&apos;t get 4K video at 60fps, and custom filters and shooting modes are absent. The main camera also has 2x zoom, flash, HDR, and effects. The Nothing Phone 2a also gives selfie fans a 32MP front-facing camera that will provide great results.</p><p>The Phone 2a has overly saturated colors but makes up for it with the wide-angle lens, which does a fantastic job in daylight pictures. The tuning can be aggressive, but the low-light and nighttime images look good when the night mode kicks in.</p><p>You can likely expect decent images from the Samsung Galaxy A35, but don&apos;t expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>-quality pictures. It features a 50MP sensor, 8MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro. Samsung falls behind in the selfie camera because it only has a 13MP front-facing camera. The Galaxy uses an automatic night mode for those low-light stills that give you good details. You also get 4K video with electronic stabilization.</p><p>While we&apos;ve had time to fully test out the Nothing Phone 2a camera, we haven&apos;t made the rounds with the Galaxy A35, so we will update this when we have fully tested it.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-a35-vs-nothing-phone-2a-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy A35 vs. Nothing Phone 2a: Which one should you buy?</h2>
<p>Both phones offer great specs for their price. The Nothing Phone 2a beats Samsung in certain areas, while the Galaxy wins on others. For example, the Galaxy A35 has a sleek and discreet look and comes with four years of OS updates and five years of security patches, while the Nothing Phone 2a comes with three years of OS updates and four years of security patches.</p><p>They&apos;re also similarly prices, with the Galaxy A35 setting you back only $399 and the Nothing Phone 2a costing just $50 shy of $400. However, you may have a hard time getting your hands on the Nothing Phone 2a if you live in the U.S., as it&apos;s only available through a developer program.</p><p>That said, if battery and customization are more important to you, the Nothing Phone 2a is the option to go with. But if having longer software support is what matters to you, it&apos;s the Galaxy way to go.</p>

<ul><li>A flag tucked away in Android 15's first beta shows Google is working to simplify and declutter an app's notification toggles in Settings.</li><li>Users will only see toggles where notification channels they've been alerted through, while everything else is hidden in a sub-menu.</li><li>Google pushed a Beta 1.1 patch for Android 15 testers on April 16, which fixes NFC for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on a way that streamlines app notification management for the user in Android 15.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-hide-unused-notification-channels-3436165/">Android Authority</a>, enabling a new flag in the first Android 15 beta produces its ability to hide unused notification channels. Currently, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, the entire list of available app notification channels is available, which makes it hard to find what you don&apos;t need.</p><p>Many of these channels are created and toggled on despite the app never pushing an alert through it. Google&apos;s latest support allows the OS to hide notification channels that an app has never used.</p><p>Android 15 code shows that users will only see notification toggles for things they&apos;ve been alerted to, like DMs, live videos, reminders, and more. Rahman states that everything else was tossed into a "Show unused channels" menu option in an app&apos;s three-dot menu in Settings.</p><p>From there, users can scroll through and see every channel an app possesses but has never been called to action. Once the function arrives, it should make it less daunting and a lot easier to quickly toggle off a notification you don&apos;t want.</p>

<p>Rahman states that the "show unused channel" option isn&apos;t appearing appropriately in the Android 15 beta unless the flag is enabled. While this likely means Google is still developing it, the feature&apos;s functionality appears quite stable and ready to go. It&apos;s likely Google could slide this into the software&apos;s stable release later this year.</p><p>The company achieved its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a> with Android 15 on April 11. Enrolled testers and developers could hop in and experiment with new app archiving and improved TalkBack support. Regarding the latter, Google stated its boosted TalkBack support involves those with braille displays using HID standard over USB and secure Bluetooth.</p><p>More recently, Google rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-1-1">minor Beta 1.1 patch</a> for Android 15 testers. One of its highlight fixes pertains to an NFC bug that previously rendered its functionality useless. Users were unable to use their Pixel phones for contactless payment; however, things seem to have been fixed. Several more fixes rolled in, such as one that solved an issue that prevented devices from installing the initial beta.</p>

The $18 Chu II is among the best entry-level IEMs you can buy, and the brand released innovative products like the Dash75 — a retro-styled mechanical keyboard that houses a DAC — in the past. </p>

<p>Moondrop also makes planar headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Venus</a>, but it has loftier ambitions for its next product, the MIAD01. Abbreviated for Mobile Internet Audio Device, MIAD01 is a phone that has a balanced 4.4mm connector alongside a single-ended 3.5mm jack, a flagship decoding chip, and independent audio circuitry that should mitigate any interference.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the phone hardware itself. The MIAD01 will have a 6.7-inch flexible OLED panel with 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh, and interestingly, 1920Hz DC dimming. In renders shared by the brand on X, the device looks like any other giant slab, with the ports located at the top.</p><p>As someone who tests enthusiast audio products along with a gazillion phones a year, it feels like the MIAD01 is tailored to my needs. Moondrop teased details of the MIAD01 at the start of the year, but I didn&apos;t take those seriously — audio brands tend to share grandiose plans all the time, but most of them don&apos;t come to fruition. In this instance, however, it looks like the brand is actually going to follow through and launch a phone.</p>

<p>Obviously, that invites a lot of questions. Why is Moondrop making a phone? Will it have the Play Store? How many updates will it get? What about after-sales service? Making a phone is significantly more challenging than audio products, and most brands instead choose to go with digital audio players. These players have a screen, decent hardware, dedicated audio circuitry, and usually run an AOSP build of Android. Think of these devices as phones without all the connectivity bits.</p><p>Fiio&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a> is a good example; it is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 660, comes with ESS Sabre&apos;s high-end ES9038Q2M DACs, a 5-inch 720p screen, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 5300mAh battery. It runs Android 10, and will make the switch to Android 12 later in the year. While Android 10 is outdated, it is still usable in this setting, as all you&apos;re doing with the interface is playing your music streaming service of choice.</p><p>Designing a phone is much more complex; it needs cellular radios, and should be able to handle a variety of mundane tasks — send texts, make calls, browse the web, use social media, play games, and everything else you do with a phone — in addition to playing music. Moondrop just doesn&apos;t have the resources or the technical knowhow to make a phone, so the MIAD01 will be a rebranded version of an existing device.</p>

<p>Considering the MIAD01 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, it limits the options to a Chinese entity. I don&apos;t see Xiaomi, Honor, or any of the BBK brands somehow turning into a white label manufacturer, so if I had to venture a guess, the MIAD01 is using an ODM that caters to smaller manufacturers, like Blu.</p><p>The blocky design of the MIAD01 is reminiscent of ZTE&apos;s Nubia Z60 Ultra, but the MIAD01 will be a mid-ranger. The brand confirmed that it will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7050, which uses older Arm v8 cores, including two Cortex A78 and six A55 cores. It will have 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, 12GB of RAM, and a MicroSD slot that holds up to 2TB cards.</p>

<p>While it&apos;s interesting to speculate on the hardware, it&apos;s the software that is the biggest limiting factor for a new brand venturing into this segment. And unlike digital audio players, AOSP doesn&apos;t cut it on a phone, so the MIAD01 will need differentiated software. And somehow, I doubt Moondrop&apos;s ability to deliver on that front; the brand&apos;s Link app to connect to its earbuds is riddled with issues, and is often unusable.</p><p>It would be ideal to have a phone that also doubles as a music player, and LG did a great job catering to this niche. But that&apos;s in the past, and I don&apos;t quite see Moondrop rising to the challenge. The brand had its share of misses in recent years, and it may have taken on too much with the MIAD01. The device will need to deliver terrific audio, and simultaneously go up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phones</a>.</p><p>A more sensible option would have been to launch a digital audio player like Fiio, HiBy, Shanling, Sony, Astell & Kern, and other audio brands, but as we&apos;ve seen in the past, Moondrop doesn&apos;t like to play by conventional rules.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi’s budget-friendly Redmi brand is back with yet another affordable tablet, dubbed Redmi Pad SE, which was just launched in the Indian market. It comes a couple of years after the Redmi Pad, which saw a global launch in 2022.</p><p>The new Redmi Pad SE is an 11-inch tablet with a 90Hz refresh rate screen and Full HD+ resolution. The screen is enclosed in an aluminum unibody design that is 7.36 mm thick and looks quite similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-launch">Redmi Pad</a>. The tablet&apos;s available color options include Mint Green, Graphite Gray, and Lavender Purple.</p>

<p>Underneath, the tablet is powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 2.4GHz clock speeds — the same chipset that powered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-accidentally-announces-redmi-10-ahead-august-18-launch">Redmi 10</a> back in 2022. It is further backed by up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage, with support for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> for up to 1TB of additional storage. </p><p>The device relies on a sole 8MP primary sensor enclosed in a rectangular camera housing. On the front, there’s still a 5MP selfie camera for video conferencing. </p><p>Keeping the lights on, the Redmi Pad SE has a massive 8,000mAh battery capacity with 10W wired charging speeds. The other notable parameters of the entry-level tablet comprise AI face unlock, Wi-Fi, support for Bluetooth 5.0, a quad-speaker system, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an Android 13-based MIUI Pad 14 operating system. Also, the budget tablet gets support from Redmi Stylus for Pad, which is likely sold separately.</p>

<p>The Redmi Pad SE will be sold in India on April 24, 2024. The base 4GB RAM variant costs Rs 12,999 (~$ $157), the 6GB RAM variant costs Rs 13,999 (~$ $169), and the 8GB RAM variant costs Rs 14,999 (~$180). However, all three variants sport only 128GB of onboard storage, with microSD support, as mentioned.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#section-update"><strong>Update (April 24, 8:55 pm ET)</strong></a>: Google says the PIN requirement for using Google Wallet on Wear OS for tap-to-pay is actually just a glitch.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet might start asking for a PIN on Wear OS watches, potentially making payments less convenient.</li><li>Some Reddit users report having to input a PIN for every payment attempt on their Wear OS watches.</li><li>The PIN prompt seems limited to a few users, suggesting it could be a test, a glitch, or a gradual rollout by Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paying with your Wear OS watch with Google Wallet might get annoying soon, as the app might start asking for a PIN before you can use the speedy payment feature.</p><p>Google Wallet taps into your Android phone and NFC to make payments super easy. It even jumped onto your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">beloved Wear OS watches</a>, so you could pay straight from your wrist. But here comes a security update that might make paying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS</a> a tad more irritating.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1c8iqw7/gpay_now_needs_to_input_pin_everytime_you_make/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> are reporting about Google Wallet making them enter a PIN every single time they try to pay with their watch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/20/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-pay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This is different from before, where just a tap did the trick. Unless your device figures out it&apos;s far enough from your body, it&apos;s not going to bug you for a PIN.</p><p>Wear OS smartwatches already make you set up a PIN for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> security, so this new pop-up for every tap seems like a bit much, especially on those tiny screens.</p><p>Since it seems like only a few users are getting hit with this new prompt, there are a couple of things that might be going down, as noted by 9to5. Maybe Google is testing out this feature on a select few watches. Or, it could be a glitch in the app. Or, Google might be slowly introducing the PIN requirement to everyone, one watch at a time.</p><p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">made phone users re-verify their Wallet information</a> after a few minutes. So, it&apos;s possible the company is doing something similar for Wear OS, which definitely removes the convenience you get with those speedy wrist taps.</p><p>However, the updated Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519" target="_blank">support page</a> doesn&apos;t even mention smartwatches, hinting that this new authentication requirement might not be on purpose.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s important to remember that this could be a security improvement Google is testing (even if it is a bit annoying), assuming this new feature is indeed heading to smartwatches.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>Google told Android Central via email that it is working on fixing the problem with Google Wallet&apos;s tap-to-pay feature on Wear OS, where it keeps asking users to enter a PIN for each transaction.</p><p>"We are aware of an issue that requires a small number of Wallet users to re-enter their PIN in order to make a payment from their Wear OS device, and we are working to address the issue," a Google spokesperson said. "There is no new authentication requirement for Wear OS users."</p><p>The company also clarified that this issue isn&apos;t connected to the recent changes it made, which now require Wallet users on Android phones to authenticate their device before making a payment through Google Wallet.</p>

<hr>
<p>Swedish EV (electric vehicle) maker Polestar has debuted its first smartphone aimed at the Chinese market.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/polestar-joins-ev-tech-crossover-with-made-for-china-smartphone">Bloomberg</a>, Polestar debuted the new phone at an event in Beijing, China, ahead of an auto show it plans to attend. The move appears to be part of a technological shift between automakers and smartphone OEMs.</p><p>Polestar states that its device is the culmination of work between its team in Gothenburg, Sweden, and China&apos;s smartphone manufacturer, Xingji Meizu Group.</p><p>Xingji Meizu&apos;s chief executive officer, Shen Ziyu, noted that the move was something of a "defensive measure due to Huawei and Xiaomi starting to make cars" and that the phone is the result of a shift as the "auto industry incorporates more intelligent technologies and consumer electronics."</p><p>The Swedish company states its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polestar.cn/zh-cn/polestar-phone/">Polestar Phone</a>" is its first "AI-designed flagship phone" for Chinese consumers. The device features a 6.7-inch display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and an 1250 nits of peak brightness. Powering the device is Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>The device&apos;s AI features include image generation, image search, and text summaries.</p>

<p>On the back, the Polestar Phone provides a vertical triple camera setup. Consumers will discover a 50MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization), a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The front contains a 32MP punch-hole selfie lens.</p><p>A 5,050mAh battery will keep the lights on throughout the day, with support for 50W Super Wireless charging. Additionally, consumers can pack up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> storage in the Polestar Phone.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company teases a strong marriage between the phone and its EVs. Polestar has equipped the device with software developed based on Meizu&apos;s "Flyme Auto." Polestar states this will create a "seamless interconnection between mobile phones and cars."</p><p>Moreover, this pairing allows messages, calls, music, and videos to be displayed on a Polestar vehicle&apos;s dashboard while driving. The device&apos;s "Polestar Link" functionality lets users utilize their phone as a UWB digital car key. </p><p>The Polestar Phone starts at 7,388 yuan in China, which is roughly $1,019.</p>

<p>Polestar&apos;s entrance into the smartphone space may seem odd; however, other Chinese makers like Nio Inc. have done the same. More importantly, smartphone OEMs like Huawei and Xiaomi have gone the opposite way, entering the EV industry with their own cars. Similarly, Waymo, owned by Google&apos;s parent company, Alphabet, operates an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/waymo-uber-partnership-announcement">array of self-driving cars</a>.</p><p>Polestar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/677700/polestar-announces-global-volumes-for-the-fourth-quarter-including-a-strong-start-to-polestar-4-deli">reported in January</a> that its EV sales have hit a slump. Polestar missed its 60,000 vehicle sales projection as it tallied 54,000 by the end of Q4 2023.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that Polestar is cutting 450 people to help cover its losses.</p>
