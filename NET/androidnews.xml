                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Until last year, I was a person who never needed to wear glasses. But life eventually caught up to me, and a combination of age and the unique strains of modern life caused me to finally visit an optometrist last Spring. While I&apos;m wearing glasses throughout the day now, a new solution from Honor could help reduce that glasses usage over time using, you guessed it, AI.</p><p>AI has been a bit of an annoying buzzword this year, but every so often a new feature breaks through all the noise and presents a solution that&apos;s <em>actually</em> a solution, not just some minor new form of convenience. Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">previously announced</a> its new AI defocus tech for the upcoming Honor Magic V3 foldable phone, but I can confirm it&apos;s also on the new Honor MagicPad 2 tablet.</p><p>Myopia is quickly becoming a global issue, as experts predict that it will affect 50% of the world&apos;s population by 2050. Honor is only one brand, and while wider adoption of this kind of technology could slow down or even reverse this negative trend entirely, optometrists I spoke with said this kind of therapy only works best for certain age groups.</p><p>I&apos;ve been testing out Honor&apos;s AI defocus tech on both the MagicPad 2 and Magic V3 for the past few weeks and it&apos;s impressive just how transparently it works. Few companies are taking eye care as seriously as Honor—something that&apos;s particularly personal to me as I&apos;ve been dealing with display-induced headaches due to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>—and the company&apos;s latest devices are a bastion of relief in a world where displays are meant to bedazzle but ultimately hurt us.</p>

<p>Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a problem created when eyes grow longer in order to better focus on objects that are arm&apos;s length or closer to them. In a world where we&apos;re constantly looking at monitors or smartphones for long periods of time throughout the day, it&apos;s not hard to understand why this is a (literal) growing problem.</p><p>But smartphone or monitor usage isn&apos;t going away in the modern age, but instead of just relying on glasses usage to fix the problem, Honor is taking a two-pronged approach. The company just introduced the first nearwork-induced transient myopia-reducing display on both the Honor Magic V3 folding phone and the Honor MagicPad 2 tablet.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An estimated 50% of the world's population will have myopia (nearsightedness) by 2050 if something isn't done to reverse the trend.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These special displays use a combination of advanced OLED display technology and AI scene understanding to recreate the effects of Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segments (DIMS) lenses, which have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjo.bmj.com/content/104/3/363">scientifically proven</a> to slow down the elongation of the eye.</p><p>In a document provided to Android Central, Honor links to several pieces of related research that show how simulated defocus solutions can help improve the eyes of anything from tree shrews to human adults when used regularly over a period of anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.71%;"><img id="3fFqsd49vEtjBzppD6Ebc9" name="bjophthalmol-2020-March-104-3-363-F3.large.jpg" alt="A chart showing the effectiveness of DIMS lenses in slowing progression of childhood myopia" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fFqsd49vEtjBzppD6Ebc9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2022" height="621" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A chart showing the effectiveness of DIMS lenses in slowing progression of childhood myopia </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: British Journal of Ophthalmology)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Special glasses can help reverse myopia, and Honor's solution aims to replicate these types of lenses as closely as possible via clever display technology.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The technology works by separating colors and keeping some in focus while "defocusing" others. There are also times when colors are changed or objects receive faint outlines that place them more or less in focus, depending on the color used. It&apos;s similar to chromatic aberration, a lens effect that separates colors via a prism, which can also be seen in 3D movies that provide artificial depth.</p><p>In essence, it simulates the act of looking away from your device at a distant object, helping to automate a process that most of us forget to do.</p><p>It&apos;s difficult to describe and even more difficult to understand unless you see it in action. Surprisingly, I didn&apos;t find that this affected image quality negatively. While I had a hard time capturing the effect on camera, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c5VtgEP43Y">YouTuber PhoneBuff</a> did an excellent job of tearing the technology apart in an easy-to-understand way in the video below.</p><p>He even corroborates the notion that the effect is normally nearly invisible to the naked eye in most circumstances, which I found particularly interesting. The big downside is that Honor&apos;s AI Defocus tech currently only works on the YouTube and Amazon Kindle apps, but Honor says it&apos;s working to expand support for more apps in the near future.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0c5VtgEP43Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that this could be a one-stop-shop solution. According to Bhavin Shah, Behavioural Optometrist at Central Vision Opticians, DIMS therapy—remember, those are the physical defocus lenses that people can wear—is generally only used in people up to age 21 and sees only a 1% success rate beyond that age.</p><p>Shah says "I don&apos;t believe that stimulating the same defocus on a screen will be detected by the peripheral retinal in the same way that the actual light hits the retina through glasses or contact lenses. I&apos;ve worn these contact lenses and glasses myself as an adult and it did not make any difference to comfort or eyestrain, the vision is much better with regular glasses or contacts compared to wearing defocus lenses."</p><p>Honor has been very careful to pen this as one additional arrow in the quiver for better eye health rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. But while it&apos;s not going to work for everyone, it may help quite a few people, and Honor&apos;s own research—plus Shah&apos;s experience—seems to corroborate the possibility.</p><p>Shah seemed hopeful about the tech so long as the study included a proper control mechanism for testers, meaning one group has the defocus AI mode enabled while one has it disabled. "If this change was better than those not using the defocus mode, then it shows some minor benefit. However, a long-term independent study would be the next step before I would start recommending it. I would have to try it myself."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor has been very careful to pen this as one additional arrow in the quiver for better eye health rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, but some experts say we need more testing to make sure it's effective.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Shah notes that "our eyes do have a system where only the central vision is clear and the peripheral part is blurred and the eyes keep moving and pointing the central part of the vision to build up a clear picture by joining the clear parts and ignoring the blur, so in theory, if the peripheral defocus were to move based on where a person is viewing the screen at any one time, there may be some effect but I would highly doubt that it would make a significant difference."</p><p>I&apos;ve seen similar mixed results in the PWM-sensitive communities on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ledstrain.org/">LEDStrain forum</a> and in Telegram groups I&apos;m a part of, where one "flicker-free" solution works wonders for some people while it does absolutely nothing to help another person.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5S4HdrkVU9qB8aimhFhg5" name="honor-magicpad-2-reading-01.jpg" alt="Reading books on an Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5S4HdrkVU9qB8aimhFhg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor MagicPad 2 utilizes DC-like dimming at high brightness and an impressive 4320Hz PWM dimming at low brightness. For reference, that&apos;s 20x better than the latest iPad Pro models. Even this solution won&apos;t work perfectly for everyone, but it can help quite a lot of people who are sensitive to light flicker, like myself.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This won't help everyone but, combined with higher PWM rates and other eye care solutions, mean that Honor is pushing the envelope for eye care more than any other brand.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Shah offered one particular ray of hope based on Honor&apos;s research results, though. "Central Choroidal thickness has been shown to increase with near work and then return to normal but there is only a little research on this subject and the impact it has on adults and eyestrain."</p><p>AI Defocus solutions like the one in the Honor MagicPad 2 and Honor Magic V3 are designed to keep Central Choroidal thickness from changing as little as possible, meaning our eyes likely won&apos;t be as negatively affected by long-term screen use if more people are able to use this kind of technology.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-better-eye-health-2">The road to better (eye) health</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MwTw3oahEAVMqGJPqoJpFo" name="honor-magicpad-2-reading-close.jpg" alt="Reading books on an Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MwTw3oahEAVMqGJPqoJpFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For this article, I spoke with three different eye care professionals and all agreed that less screen time is the best solution. Dr. James R. Kelly from Kelly Vision Center recommends a simple 20/20/20 vision break rule along with frequent blinking when working on screens or using your tablet or phone for a long time. The 20/20/20 rule "means taking a visual break every 20 minutes where the individual looks at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds."</p><p>Frequent blinking might sound funny, but it&apos;s been shown that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hub.salford.ac.uk/appliedcognition/2021/08/27/2068/">blinking decreases by 66%</a> when focusing on something. Additional research has shown that the blink rate for displays versus books <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413278/">isn&apos;t any different</a>, but few people—in the past or otherwise—would spend as much time reading a book as often as most people look at a computer monitor or smartphone, meaning most of us don&apos;t blink as often as we should.</p><p>Shah builds upon this specifically for children, saying "it would be better to give them better habits like cutting screen time, taking breaks, and holding the device further away." In fact, new smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> encourage not only fun outdoor play but also reduced screen time, setting hard limits on games to only a few minutes of screen time per session.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QPiwKDd47VagREzJKrkYv7" name="honor-magicpad-2-watching-youtube.jpg" alt="Watching a YouTube video on the Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QPiwKDd47VagREzJKrkYv7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while kids can get away with reduced screen time, it&apos;s not a reality for most working adults in the modern age. Dr. Kelly recommends "proper distancing and angling of screens, along with blue light blocking filters and anti-glare filters, and making sure screens are clean and smudge-free to reduce glare and reflections."</p><p>Samsung actually took a fascinating step toward this last part with the display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, giving it anti-glare properties but the company didn&apos;t go far enough to reduce the amount of flicker coming from its relatively slow 480Hz PWM rate. Remember, Honor is pushing 10x that number on its phones and tablets.</p><p>Additionally, Dr. Kelly recommends proper room lighting to avoid eye fatigue and strain. I&apos;ve personally had to remove all smart lights and LED strips from my home office because nearly <em>all</em> of them use PWM dimming and flicker at all brightness levels. I&apos;ve since switched them out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019KKEXOE/">these Sylvania LED bulbs</a> from Amazon that are not only inexpensive but are also non-dimmable, which is usually the code word in the LED world for "doesn&apos;t use PWM."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xSqe5EujsH5kjRGvWBRM78" name="honor-magicpad-2-back-01.jpg" alt="The back of the white Honor MagicPad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xSqe5EujsH5kjRGvWBRM78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My verdict on the Honor MagicPad 2 and Honor Magic V3 displays? Superb. Sublime, even. The MagicPad 2 has the better display because it&apos;s a more consistent PWM rate at low brightness. It uses true 4320Hz PWM at low brightness whereas only the inner display in the Magic V3 has true 4320Hz—the outer display is identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>&apos;s 3840Hz panel, which uses an accelerated 360Hz DC-like cycle to achieve a higher overall PWM frequency.</p><p>Either way, I&apos;ve had no discomfort from either device after weeks of use, which is a lot more than I can say about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. If all else fails, the only other real solution is just to spend more time outdoors and less time in front of screens.</p>

<p>September is here and that means one thing: all the kids are headed back to school. Kids these days are so lucky because their back-to-school shopping is <em>very</em> different from my time. Forget about contraband MP3 players and CDs, school-going children now have smartphones, tablets, and fancy school things like digital notebooks.</p><p>If you&apos;re parenting in this modern age, it&apos;s probably a very daunting task to choose the right gear for your kids. Sure, technology brings numerous advantages, but it also comes with disadvantages, such as being too distracting for students. A balance between usability and practicality must be struck.</p><p>There&apos;s no one-size-fits-all recommendation to be made here, different age groups and different children have different needs. But I can draw from my own experience to help you choose the right gear for your schoolchildren.</p><p>So, here&apos;s a list of devices and accessories that I would have found useful when I myself was a schoolgirl. Many of these inclusions would have changed my studying game completely, had they existed back then. If I were still in school, these are the things that I would buy.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">fantastic E Ink tablet</a> that runs Android can last for weeks on a single charge. Most of them have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and access to the Google Play Store. You get stylus input, expandable storage, USB-C OTG and charging, and even colored displays on some models. It&apos;s the perfect non-intrusive device for a child who&apos;s still in school and has young eyeballs that need extra protection from screen exposure.</p><p>There are countless advantages to getting a school student an e-ink tablet. I can&apos;t help but imagine how many more books I could have read and how easy it would have been to take notes and search them if I had one myself in school.</p><p>It&apos;s no secret that I&apos;m a HUGE fan of e-paper tablets. Having watched them evolve over decades, the current form of E Ink tablets is unbelievable and almost seems too good to be true at times.</p><p>We can all thank Amazon for popularizing e-paper devices with its Kindle lineup of e-readers. But Kindle models have failed to break out of their traditional moulds. Where Kindles failed, brands like Onyx Boox, Bigme, and PocketBook took over. My vote of approval for the most well-rounded E Ink tablet goes to the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C, the colored version of the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Note Air 3</a>.</p>

<p>Older children need a smartphone to find their way around places and for basic communication with family and important contacts such as emergency services. They&apos;re also helpful for tasks like online research, photography, and note-taking.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t make sense to buy your child the latest, most expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> that costs over a thousand dollars. I&apos;d have chosen something affordable yet feature-rich for my own school days. Personally, I feel like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)</a> would have been the ideal choice.</p><p>If your child likes drawing and taking notes, a stylus-bearing phone like the Moto G Stylus 5G is perfect. It costs below $350, comes with easy-to-navigate stock Android, and has just powerful enough specs for a teenager or younger kid to make do with. The note-taking feature stands out in particular, as students can take advantage of it the most.</p>

<p>Portability plays an important role for all school-going children as they need to take their books and gear to school with them. Anything too heavy can cause back pain, and that&apos;s the last thing you want for a child.</p><p>Laptops offer a complete mobile PC experience, but students can get everything they need from cheap, small-sized Chromebooks. Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Lenovo Duet 5 Chromebook</a> for example. This 13.3-inch device is lightweight, supports USI stylus input, comes with a featherweight keyboard stand, and has a lovely OLED display with touch input as well. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">most suitable Chromebook for students</a> of various age groups.</p><p>Chrome OS has all the basic apps that kids need for school, and they can access the web version of whatever isn&apos;t natively available through Google Chrome. A Chromebook like the Duet 5 costs a fraction of the cost of a full-blown laptop, and it doubles as a tablet as well. Your ward gets two functions in one form factor with a 2-in-1, making them ideal PC alternatives.</p>

<p>Audio accessories have been essential for students for generations. Whether you grew up in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or whenever, you definitely used music to cope with teenage angst and coming of age, and as a form of self-expression.</p><p>Today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/best-mp3-players">MP3 players</a> and mixtapes have been replaced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and headphones. Audio accessories are helpful on train rides or plane rides home, for focusing on a topic during an intense study session, to kill time between classes, and also for formal matters like attending online classes or lectures.</p><p>As a student, I&apos;d prioritize comfort and longevity over all else. Of course, sound quality is important, but the earbuds or headphones also need to be robust, ergonomic, and long-lasting. Who wants to charge their headphones every day? And of course, budget plays a pivotal role in choosing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> or earphones for students as well.</p><p>I&apos;d choose budget busters with the most value as my audio gear of choice if I were still in school, something that has good noise cancelation and brilliant battery life. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> earbuds and Edifier WH950NB headphones are my top picks in terms of value for money.</p>

<p>Assuming I had most or some of the items on this list during my school days, I&apos;d want to have at least these three accessories to go with them. Students need little knick-knacks like power banks and a Bluetooth mouse. If you&apos;re planning on getting your offspring a phone, you should definitely get a phone grip to go with it as well.</p><p>Phone grips prevent serious cracks and damage to smartphones. My own phone has been saved from disaster multiple times because I had a phone grip, preventing what would otherwise have been a fatal fall. Grips also thwart repeated stress injuries. Since kids use their phones almost 24/7, it&apos;s a good idea to protect their fingers from possible repetitive stress injuries. I prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe grips</a> like the one from PopSockets as they can be taken on and off whenever required.</p><p>Power banks can be useful in a pinch, letting students top up their mobile devices on the go. It&apos;s hard to find a plug point on campus sometimes. Something small and slim but with a good charging speed is suitable for students. The Zendure SuperMini 10000mAh is ultra-portable, supports 20W input and output, comes with a Type-C cable, and costs a mere $30. Talk about a steal!</p><p>A versatile Bluetooth mouse works across multiple platforms, maximizing value. I&apos;d pick something that works with Android, Chrome OS, and Windows seamlessly but doesn&apos;t break the bank. Logitech is the go-to brand for any mouse worth its salt!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple has unwrapped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 16</a> along with a new watch and some updated headphones. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve noticed.</p><p>It was a bit of a letdown, mostly because Apple told us everything cool the last time it took the stage to introduce "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">Apple Intelligence</a>", its take on the AI features we&apos;re used to seeing from every phone maker. Really, this event was about the hardware that powers the software we already knew about.</p>
<p>Maybe that&apos;s why this time things felt like the most un-Apple-like Apple event so far. To be frank, it resembled something we would see from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google</a> — filled with numbers and tech terms that you or I might find interesting, but things that most of its customers aren&apos;t concerned with.</p><p>Remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">Google telling us about tokens</a> without telling us <em>why</em> tokens were important during the Google I/O keynote? While Apple didn&apos;t use the same word, time was taken to explain the different processors inside the SoC and how each supported the new version of iOS and its AI.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast compared to years past. You might be old and nerdy enough to remember Steve Jobs showing off the YouTube app. He told us all that we could watch YouTube videos right on the iPhone without them spitting and stuttering. People into the tech understood why — a powerful processor and software optimizations — and everyone else, the people who were going to buy the iPhone, knew everything they needed to know: the iPhone could do what their BlackBerrys and Palm phones couldn&apos;t. </p><p>There was no need to talk about memory bandwidth or processor cores. it was implied and interested people understood. It&apos;s what made me spend way too much money at AT&T and buy one even though I knew better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e9pwH7nrQbyNqQE3FDCpNL" name="iphone-15-pro-max-accessories-19.jpg" alt="Best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e9pwH7nrQbyNqQE3FDCpNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This happened gradually and it&apos;s something Apple <em>had</em> to do. Apple has a tight hold on just a few national markets and if Samsung or OnePlus is telling everyone how fast and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-13-is-making-its-debut-way-sooner-than-expected">how good their hardware is</a> Apple has to have a response. It wants to keep that grip on markets that make it so much money and even the smallest thing could have an effect. Apple is already the cool and trendy phone in the eyes of consumers but it can&apos;t afford to let another company grab that spot in the eyes of the tech community.</p>
<p>I won&apos;t lie, I don&apos;t hate it. That&apos;s because I enjoy hearing about the numbers and neural pathways from Apple the same way I like hearing Google tell me how many tokens (the smallest, most basic units of data in AI processing) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Tensor G4</a> can handle. But I&apos;m definitely not the average consumer even if I want to be or try to think like one.</p><p>Maybe this doesn&apos;t take away from the message but it sure makes the presentation longer. I wonder if the people looking to buy a new iPhone would rather hear more about the new camera control button or hear a refresher on how the new Siri can harness generative AI from a cloud provider instead. </p><p>These things are cool and what people using phones are going to talk about to their friends. Nobody cares about the chip inside AirPods or how a custom piece of glass covers a button for the camera except nerds like me, and maybe you. They care why these things matter and what having them means when you&apos;re using the products.</p>
<p>This won&apos;t change and as tech events move further away from in-person to over the top scripted videos it will only get worse. There was a lot of things I didn&apos;t like about Steve Jobs but I loved the way he directed events and spoke to users, not the tech press.</p><p>The new Apple has moved away from that and is following in the footsteps of every other tech company.</p>

If you&apos;re a Quest 2 player who is looking to play some hot new releases like Batman: Arkham Shadow, you might want to consider upgrading to a Quest 3 this year. There&apos;s even a cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> rumored to debut this Fall for folks on a budget, ensuring that Quest 3-exclusive games aren&apos;t relegated to Meta&apos;s most expensive headset.</p><p>Ready for greatness?

<p>We thoroughly enjoyed Hitman 3 VR when it launched on PSVR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/hitman-3-psvr-hands-on">three years ago</a> but the game was held back immensely by the PSVR&apos;s controls and limited movement. IO Interactive realized this deficiency and allowed XR Games — a veteran VR developer behind titles like Zombieland VR, the ForeVR series, and several others — to completely reimagine the game from a VR-centric perspective.</p><p>The result is a bit of a mixed bag, but one that can still be enjoyed if you can put up with the bugs. The developer says they&apos;re hard at work to get them patched up so it&apos;s completely understandable if you want to wait for that to happen, but there&apos;s always the option to buy now if you can&apos;t wait.</p><p><strong>Buy now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/hitman-3-psvr-hands-on">Meta Horizon store</a></p>

<p>It&apos;s time to get Fracked this year as the action-packed PSVR and Oculus Rift game comes to the Meta Quest platform for the first time. This one packs no punches as it flings players along a riveting story filled with shooting, skiing, climbing, and psychedelic mushrooms.</p><p>This one has been much better reviewed than Hitman 3, so if you&apos;re itching for some high-action shooting this month, Fracked is the one to get.</p><p><strong>Buy now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/fracked/8074885222534394/">Meta Horizon store</a></p>

<p>Who doesn&apos;t love a good time-travel adventure story? I know I sure do, and this complete reboot of the PSVR&apos;s Wanderer looks to not only address complaints but adds tons of new content and ideas, culminating in an experience that&apos;s basically brand-new.</p><p>The game prides itself on instant time travel, eschewing loading screens for a far more wow-worthy experience as you jump between characters and places in an effort to rewrite the past in order to reshape the future.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>September 12, 2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5479628732140032/">wishlist now</a>)</p>

<p>It&apos;s aliens versus humans in the 2v3 asymmetrical multiplayer game where three aliens will be hiding in plain sight for the humans to find them. At the start of each round, aliens will disguise themselves as human mannequins while up to two human players try to find them using a set of specialized tools.</p><p>But if a human guesses wrong and fires at the wrong mannequin, their gun will jam, leaving them open to attack. It&apos;s a fascinating concept that we haven&apos;t yet seen in VR and should present plenty of incredible opportunities for memorable events to happen.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>September 12, 2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7028027297235918">free trial available now</a>)</p>

Slice and dice demons to the beat of epic metal songs and channel your inner demon slayer as you sweat it out! This isn&apos;t a normal rhythm game and you won&apos;t be shooting or slicing beat blocks as they move down the frets. Instead, you&apos;ll be scored by how you can attack to the beat of the song. Time shots perfectly and you&apos;ll get perfect scores.</p><p>The best part is that these are all original songs made for the game and sung by Serj Tankian (System of a Down), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), and more. But this isn&apos;t just a VR port of the flat game. The developers say they&apos;ve redesigned the whole experience to fit VR&apos;s unique immersive qualities, so get ready to venture into Hell and bang some heads!</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> September 26, 2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6490578927725908/">wishlist now</a>)</p>

<p>Classic PC shooter fans rejoice! Wrath: Aeon of Ruin is coming to VR in all its pixel-packing glory, complete with visuals that look right out of the original classic Quake. It&apos;s a classic no-holds-barred FPS that emphasizes speed and brutality with plenty of gibs to be had along the way.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-roboquest-vr"><span>Roboquest VR</span></h3>

<p>"A fast-paced Roguelite FPS in a scorched futureworld" doesn&apos;t exactly sound like new and exciting material in the world of VR games, but this made-for-VR port of the original Steam game should get you excited if the 13,000 "overwhelmingly positive" reviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/692890/Roboquest/">on Steam</a> have anything to say about it. This one&apos;s brought to you by the incomparable Flat2VR Studios and promises plenty of sweat when it lands later this year.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>

<p>Tactical games were made for VR, and Vestiges: Fallen Tribes aims to prove that this is a genre that needs a lot more love from VR developers. Command dozens of units in PvP battles armed with your wits and your trusty deck of cards.</p><p>The game comes from the developers of Ragnarock, a hit music game that&apos;s a blast to play.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>

<p>Next Move is a VR platformer with a twist. You won&apos;t be using joysticks or teleporting to get around, just your arms. But this isn&apos;t Gorilla Tag-style locomotion, either. The idea is that you&apos;ll run in place, climb, hang, and, of course, jump your way through surreal worlds.</p><p>And it&apos;s not just platforming that&apos;s happening in Next Move. The game is also filled with puzzles and even time traveling elements, letting you rewind your mistakes or use time as a way to solve intricate puzzles. What&apos;s your next move?</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024 (Try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6647889621939966/">free demo now</a>)</p>

<p>There&apos;s nothing like a good strategy game against other humans. Expansion channels a bit of Starcraft in a semi-tower defense package, giving you units to quickly place in a race to overtake the enemy&apos;s base.</p><p>The game is available in early access now with a full release scheduled sometime this year.</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> 2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5803116093043612">play early access now</a>)</p>

<p>Starship Home is a dedicated mixed reality experience that relies on the Quest 3&apos;s color passthrough vision, putting alien decor around your actual home.</p><p>The idea is that your living room becomes an actual starship, letting you cruise around the galaxy in comfort and familiarity while still inviting mystery and intrigue into your space. An interstellar crisis unfolds sometime during your travels and only you can solve the problems that will inevitably befall you.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5959677854068956/">wishlist now</a>)</p>

<p>As a kid, I played plenty of games like Paperboy and Road Rash but I never thought any developer would somehow meld the two together, much less in VR. Enter Throwback, a game that tasks players with tossing newspapers, fighting aliens, and getting high scores as they adventure out into the great unknown and far beyond the usual paperboy route.</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> 2024</p>

<p>Self-described as a liminal action horror game, Defy aims to defy your expectations of reality and answer the question "can you really have enough horror games in VR?" Traverse dark hallways, run from twisted creatures, and sweat with terror all from the <em>comfort</em> of your living room.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>

<p>What&apos;s better than killing zombies or Nazis? Killing zombie Nazis, of course! Hitler may have already been eradicated, but his freakish zombie army is still on the loose and needs to be stopped before it destroys all of Europe in its path.</p><p>The VR adaptation of the popular series puts you in the shoes of the elite Deadhunters squad. Authentic World War II weapons are on full display with detailed reloading mechanics and the return of the x-ray cam, giving you full view of your best sniping shots in detail only VR can provide. You can even play co-op with a friend and save Europe together as you level up your skills and weaponry.</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> 2024 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6133688003342021/">wishlist now</a>)</p>

<p>You&apos;ll find plenty of first-person action games on the Meta Quest platform, but there aren&apos;t too many traditional fighting games on the system. Final Fury channels the awe and wonder of 90s and early 2000s console fighting games, transforming the perspective from side-scrolling to first-person in this arcade-style fighter.</p><p>The roseter of futuristic combatants each comes with their own unique abilities and combos, and developer Kluge — the folks behind the ever-popular Synth Riders — have taken the time to figure out how traditional fighting mechanics could translate to a VR space without feeling like a cheesefest.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>

<p>Humans have been cooking up ways to live on Mars for decades, and in Grim that concept is finally a reality. The problem is that something has gone horribly wrong and now the denizens of Mars have to fend for themselves in a hostile environment that&apos;s just plain inhospitable for humans.</p><p>Unfortunately, this means resources are scarce and often the only way to survive is by taking from others. You&apos;ll be gathering resources, procuring supplies, and crafting your own base all while trying to survive against other players in the process. This new game by the Ghost of Tabor developers certainly seems ready to turn the tables of VR multiplayer once again!</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> 2024</p>

<p>What if you took the time-stopping combat concept from SUPERHOT VR and reversed it? COLD VR answers that question and, instead of holding as still as possible to plan your next move, you&apos;ll need to move as often as possible before the rogue AI in this simulation catches up with you.</p><p>If anything, the action in COLD VR can be described as similar to that 2006 Jason Statham movie Crank where the protagonist will die if he stops moving. If the crazy AI bots after you aren&apos;t enough, environmental hazards like lasers will keep you on your toes and planning ahead despite not being able to hold still. Good luck!</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024 (play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636890/COLD_VR/">Steam VR demo</a> on PC now)</p>

<p>Surviving the zombie apocalypse is better with friends you can trust, and this zombie-themed survival MMO from the developers of Ghosts of Tabor understands that concept at its heart.</p><p>Little is known about the title other than what&apos;s seen in the trailer above, but we imagine it&apos;ll go for a grander scope than Ghosts of Tabor, all while honing the realistic survival mechanics the team has strived to perfect in that title.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2024</p>

<p>Flatout is legendary in the world of racing games because of its physics-based gameplay that mashes destruction derby&apos;s brutal crashes with the fun of an arcade racer. Flat2VR studios has started development of the port to VR but we don&apos;t expect it until sometime in 2025 at the earliest.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBD</p>

<p>Ever since modern VR headsets debuted in 2016, gamers have been wishing for a VR remake of the classic Portal games from Valve. While Valve still hasn&apos;t delivered the goods, one other developer seems brave enough to try its hand at matching up to the gaming classic.</p><p>Warp Lab takes the portal concept from Portal and adds in sentient beings, guns, and a host of other environmental challenges that attempt to not only bring Portal in VR but to one-up its action sequences with plenty unique ones of its own.</p><p>Until then, you can try out the free mixed reality experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5171239959667608/#?">on App Lab</a>.</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> TBD</p>

<p>Fans of classic rolling puzzler games like Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball will no doubt love Puttzzle. A fantastical mashup of putt-putt golf and classic puzzlers, Puttzzle aims to deliver clever mechanics, tough puzzles, and lots of fun. Better yet, if you&apos;ve got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest" target="_blank">SideQuest</a> set up on for your Quest, you can play a version of the game right now.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBD (try it now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/15289/puttzzle" target="_blank">SideQuest</a>)</p>

<p>This heartwarming puzzler is a full remake of the classic Tin Hearts game on consoles, rebuilt from the ground up for VR headsets. Tin Hearts sees players guiding little toys along a treacherous route filled with adventure, magic, and plenty of mystery. This one is by the folks who put together the iconic Fable series and is sure to delight with VR-centric mechanics that make the mechanics feel even better than the original release.</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBD</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve ever wondered what people of ancient times did to pass the time, you&apos;re about to find out. Ancient Board Games is exactly what you would imagine, packing a series of historical board games into one VR game that lets you battle against your friends using the knowledge of the ancients.</p><p>From what we can gather from the trailer, you&apos;ll be visiting various regions throughout ancient Mesopotamia, enjoying scenic views while you defeat friends and foes alike with your newfound skills.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBD</p>

<p>Fly through an obstacle-strewn portal to its end in Cosmic Overdrive. Its gameplay reminds us a bit of the asteroid fields and warp zones of Star Fox 64, only in first-person and without the talking animals. You&apos;ll need to dodge some obstacles with your reflexes and lateral thrusters while blasting away others in procedurally-generated on-rails courses. </p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> TBD</p>

<p>Next Player Please sees players sitting around a physical table, passing the headset to one another to complete minigames with just their hands. The trick here — at least based on the trailer — is that the VR headset doesn’t have a strap and players don’t use controllers.</p><p>Those two key points make it easy to pass the headset along to others quickly, as what appear to be Wario Ware-style minigames will likely be faster-paced than in other VR titles. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5650602208290013/" target="_blank"><strong>Beta available now</strong></a></p><p><strong>Full Release date: </strong>TBD</p>

<p>The announcement video gives no release window and shows no new footage, but we do know a little bit about the new title thanks to some short developer interviews. The original is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-games-give-you-real-workout">best exercise games on the Quest 2</a>, and the sequel will be "co-developed" by original creator Ian Fitz and Halfbrick Studios (Fruit Ninja VR 2).</p><p>Thrill of the Fight 2 promises "to improve the mechanics to make fights feel fairer and more realistic." Plus, the team is adding in multiplayer, more fighting combinations, and lots of other new mechanics as they say "player needs have evolved" over the years in VR.</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> TBD</p>

<p>The developers of A Township Tale are working on a new game that lets players delve into dungeons deep together, hacking and slashing at monsters and earning loot along the way. It sure looks a lot like Dungeons of Eternity to us but we&apos;re sure the developers have something unique to bring to the table given the pedigree of A Township Tale.</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBD</p>

<hr>
<p>Speculation continues about Samsung&apos;s next S25 series as a tipster supposedly details its exact dimensions.</p><p>Posts on X have piled on the Galaxy S25 Ultra leaks as well-known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1832329253448265821">Ice Universe</a> claims to have its measurements nailed (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-ultra-dimensions-leak-slim-design/">SamMobile</a>). Rumors state the next Ultra model will have the following dimensions: 162.8mm x 77.6mm x 8.2mm. Of course, the standout of these claims is the final measurement for "H" (height), which is a bit thinner than we&apos;re used to.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1832344232889348326">follow-up post</a>, the tipster posted a long list of Galaxy Ultra model phones, but most notably the S24 Ultra: 162.3 x 79.0 x 8.6 mm). The proposed dimensions don&apos;t paint an S25 Ultra that&apos;s <em>wildly </em>thinner than last year&apos;s. However, it&apos;s a move in a nice direction.</p><p>Additionally, we have the length and width of the S25 Ultra, which may see more <em>narrow</em> changes. Rumors suggest the next model will be slightly taller and roughly 1.4mm slimmer than its predecessor. The publication also speculates the phone will feature Corning Gorilla Glass, as well as a continuation of an in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>

<p>The recent leaks are finally giving us the (supposed) numbers regarding the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-thinnest-lightest-model-rumor">previous "thin" rumors</a>. It was suggested in August that Samsung&apos;s next model would be the "thinnest and lightest" Ultra model that it ever created. We&apos;re finally seeing what could be in terms of how thin the device may be; however, the device&apos;s weight is still under question.</p><p>Those rumors claimed that the S25 Ultra would create stronger competition between other devices in both areas. Regarding a "lightweight" device, Samsung would need to undercut the 221 grams of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.

Samsung was rumored to rework the screen-to-body ratio of the S25 Ultra, which may result in a narrower aspect ratio. The latest rumors see the device growing slightly taller, but also coming in on the sides, doubling down on this old theory.</p><p>The Korean OEM is also supposedly dropping the squared corners from the S25 Ultra and instead implementing rounded corners to aid user comfortability.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor is going all in on AI, and following its recent IFA 2024 conference, the company is already teasing its next flagship smartphone.</p><p>In a press release, the Chinese OEM offered insight into some new standout AI features coming to its Magic 7 series. Honor&apos;s CEO George Zhao stated during a keynote speech that the new "AI Agent" is an "always-on personal assistant designed to enhance and simplify users&apos; daily lives."</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Honorglobal/status/1832032016998838765">accompanying X thread</a>, the AI Agent is said to understand your "intent" and make "intelligent" decisions based on your needs. The software will analyze your language to help its decision-making while utilizing "UI awareness" to pick up on your habits.</p><p>Honor states its AI Agent works cross-platform, providing users with its intelligent assistance across apps and services. This gives users an avenue toward automatic app subscription cancellation through voice commands.</p><p>The company also mentioned that its new cross-service app will handle things like managing notifications, ordering food, controlling smart home devices, transferring files between apps, and more.</p><p>Zhao also revealed the Magic 7 series&apos; new "AI Deepfake Detection" software. Honor aims to tackle the rise of deepfakes and face-swapping tech, which has been increasingly misused by some unsavory individuals.</p><p>Honor says its detection software uses "advanced algorithms to meticulously analyze various elements" across a suspected deepfake&apos;s face. These details include pixel-level facial imperfections, positioning of synthetic traces, and inter-frame continuity.</p><p>Honor is reportedly quite confident in its software&apos;s ability to detect a deepfake or face-swap as it focuses on user privacy/security with the next Magic series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone assistants are not new, but by harnessing the power of AI, we’re proud to present the first on-device AI Agent for the open ecosystem. #HONORIFA2024 #UnfoldYourMagic pic.twitter.com/iXRt8GPxsH<a href="https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1832032016998838765">September 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This is the second time Honor has discussed its proposed deepfake detection software. The first was during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">MWC Shanghai</a> where the company highlighted its uses during video calls. Honor estimated that its software could determine deepfake/face-swapped visuals in "three seconds." The company also detailed its "AI Defocus Eye Protection," which helps to cut back on eye strain.</p><p>The feature focuses on myopia (nearsightedness) and was confirmed to arrive on the Magic V3 foldable. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Android Central has confirmed</a> that it&apos;s available on Honor&apos;s MagicPad 2. The company&apos;s tablet also picked up some pretty neat AI tools to help organize your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">messy math homework</a>.</p><p>Honor&apos;s press release didn&apos;t go in-depth about its upcoming Magic 7 series. The series will likely launch in early 2025, similar to the debut of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-series-launch-china">6 series in January</a>. The Magic 6 and 6 Pro offer Android 14 with Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. If Honor is looking to power its new era into AI, it seems wise to speculate that Android 15 and the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> will have a spot in the 7 series.</p>

However, now that Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 "Glow Up" presentation has come and gone, we&apos;re left wondering how the company managed to stretch this into an almost two-hour event. </p><p>While the iPhone 16 series definitely presents some stiff competition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, the lines between iOS and Android are becoming more blurred by the day. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> around the corner, Apple is already "borrowing" a bunch of features from Android in the way of customization. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and Apple Watch Series 10 are "borrowing" a few more things that we first found in the Android space. </p>
<h2 id="sleep-apnea-warnings-galaxy-watch-7-and-ultra-2">Sleep Apnea warnings - Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc" name="sleep-apnea-warning-apple-watch-series-10.jpeg" alt="Sleep Apnea warning on Apple Watch Series 10 and iPhone 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2164" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although Apple plays it up pretty well, there&apos;s really not all that much that&apos;s different between the Series 9 and Series 10. In fact, Samsung beat Apple to the punch by a month, as one of the defining features announced during the Series 10&apos;s introduction — Sleep Apnea warnings — is already available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>Making things even worse for Apple is that this functionality is expected to be made available on last year&apos;s Galaxy Watch 6 series. Meanwhile, the same can&apos;t be said for the Apple Watch, as it appears this new feature is only available for the Series 10.</p>
<h2 id="training-load-garmin-coros-and-others-2">Training Load - Garmin, COROS, and others</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ptPEUTz2T8zrhYUCQKzofc" name="load-training-apple-watch-ultra-2.jpeg" alt="Training Load feature on Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptPEUTz2T8zrhYUCQKzofc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2277" height="1281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another unsurprising feature coming to the Apple Watch is "Training Load." Apple describes this as "an insightful new way to measure how the intensity and duration of workouts impact a user&apos;s body over time." As you might suspect, this isn&apos;t anything new in the wearable space, as it&apos;s already available on smartwatches from the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">Garmin and COROS</a>. </p><p>Google is even getting in on the fun with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a>" is being added. Giving credit where credit is due, Training Load isn&apos;t limited to the Apple Watch Series 10, as it will be available on older Apple Watch models when watchOS 11 rolls out. </p>
<h2 id="dedicated-apos-camera-control-apos-button-htc-evo-3d-2">Dedicated &apos;Camera Control&apos; button - HTC EVO 3D</h2>

<p>When the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max were said to be capable of capturing 3D content, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/four-things-iphone-15-stole-from-android">I pointed out</a> that this was first available on the HTC EVO 3D in 2017. While the cameras on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have been improved, now offering Spatial Audio Recording, that&apos;s not the latest feature Apple is borrowing from a seven-year-old phone.</p><p>Instead, it&apos;s the Camera Control button found on the frame of the entire iPhone 16 lineup. Unlike the Evo 3D and other Android phones that offer dedicated camera buttons, the iPhone 16 uses a capacitive button. In doing so, you&apos;re able to make adjustments and switch between modes just by tapping and swiping left or right. The problem is that being a capacitive button means that it might not work as advertised if you&apos;re taking pictures in the rain or just have wet hands. </p><p>I never really would have thought that Apple would be harkening back to a phone that was pretty much an immediate flop. </p>
<h2 id="visual-intelligence-google-lens-and-circle-to-search-2">Visual Intelligence - Google Lens and Circle to Search</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2137px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NGcReMYfg9WS2zztqBMDFd" name="visual-intelligence-iphone-16-pro-3.jpeg" alt="Apple Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NGcReMYfg9WS2zztqBMDFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2137" height="1202" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular new features to come to Android this year has been Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. This lets you simply circle something on your display and instantly get information about it. It&apos;s basically a supercharged version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a>, analyzing what&apos;s on your screen as opposed to needing to open the Camera app. </p><p>During the iPhone 16 announcement, "Visual Intelligence" was introduced, which was described as being "like an amalgamation of Circle to Search and Lens" by Android Central Editor in Chief, Shruti Shekar. Point your iPhone at a restaurant and instantly see reviews. Are you going by a concert poster and want to add it to your calendar? Use your iPhone. Do you want to know how much something costs online? Just use your iPhone.</p><p>All of this was already possible with Android, and even some of it is possible on the iPhone with the Google app. However, Apple did give us a tease for ChatGPT integration, as it appears that you&apos;ll also be able to use Visual Intelligence paired with ChatGPT in the future. </p>

<p>The new Camera Control button is probably going to garner more headlines, but those who use their iPhone to capture video will <em>probably</em> be happy to see 4K video recording at 120fps. No matter how you look at it, this is a great addition, but the truth is that Apple wasn&apos;t first. </p><p>Although there aren&apos;t very many Android phones that offer the ability to record video in 4K/120, the iPhone isn&apos;t the first phone to do so. Instead, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-5-iv-launch">Sony&apos;s Xperia 5 Mark IV</a> was the first in 2022, but we&apos;ve also seen this arrive for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-unleashes-the-x100-ultra-to-take-on-the-xiaomi-14-ultra">Vivo X100 Ultra</a>. We can also assume that it will be available on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which will be here before we know it.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-anything-left-for-apple-2">Is there anything left for Apple?</h2>
<p>I&apos;m not really sure what else is left for Apple to steal from Android phones. I can&apos;t help but feel as though the lines are getting more and more blurred, which is great, but it also could mean more people jump switch to the iPhone. However, there is one thing that you won&apos;t find on Apple&apos;s website, and that&apos;s a foldable phone. </p><p>Of course, I had to shoe-horn foldable phones into this, but it&apos;s also the reality. Rumors and reports suggest Apple is still at least a year or two away from releasing a foldable phone. But, it will be interesting to see what happens in the meantime. </p>

<p>These days, the best Android phones under $300 don&apos;t require you to compromise a good experience. As mobile technology gets better and more affordable, you can enjoy features like full 5G connectivity, good software support, and fast charging, all without having to pay a fortune. Know what&apos;s even better? These sub-$300 phones often have some goodies like 3.5mm audio ports and expansion slots, which are no longer found on flagship devices.</p><p>At Android Central, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central">we test dozens of phones</a> per year, including ones that are less expensive or flashy, so our recommendations come with first-hand testing and reviews.</p><p>My top pick is the CMF Phone 1 by Nothing, a $200 phone that feels nothing like a budget pick. Not only does it have a unique modular design, but it&apos;s got a top-class OLED display, cameras you&apos;d normally find on $400+ phones, great software features, and an impressive software update commitment. But Nothing had to compromise somewhere to meet that $200 price point, which means NFC isn&apos;t included.</p><p>That&apos;s why there are so many other picks on this list, because while the CMF Phone 1 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">the only good $200 phone I&apos;ve ever used</a>, some other phones here might fill a particular niche better for you. Ready to spend less and still love the phone you get? Here are the best Android phones you can get for less than $300.</p>

<p>There <em>a lot</em> to love about the Poco X6 Pro, but its design will be the first standout feature you see—especially if you choose the yellow vegan leather version. Plus, fast 67W charging, a great main camera, and lots of features round it out.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) makes jotting down notes and precise screen interactions a cakewalk. It's the best mid-range phone Motorola has ever made, yet easy to find for under $300.</p>

<p>The CMF Phone 1 is the most exciting budget phone I&apos;ve ever used. It&apos;s also the only <strong>truly good</strong> $200 phone I&apos;ve ever used and regularly feels more like a $400 phone. The first thing you&apos;ll notice about it, though, is the unique modular design. The back is held on with five removable screws and can be swapped out with several different colors and styles from the company.</p><p>Nothing also released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/12318-cmf-phone-1-a-platform-for-builders">official 3D printing guides</a>, meaning you can make your own accessories and backs or buy one from the 3D printing community! A plethora of unique accessories are hot-swappable via the single large thumbscrew on the bottom right, making it easy to pop on a kickstand, lanyard, or anything else you can dream up.</p><p>Aside from the design, the rest of the phone is simply brilliant. The bright OLED panel up front is not only wonderful to look at in any light but it&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e43pS8h7kzM">incredibly eye-friendly</a>. It&apos;s got the most powerful processor in its price class by far, giving you plenty of power for everyday tasks and surprisingly excellent gaming performance, as well.</p><p>The only reason this phone doesn&apos;t get the award for best camera under $300 is because the Pixel 6a exists, but it&apos;s barely a step down from that phone. Plus, the CMF Phone 1 takes much better portrait photos than the Pixel thanks to the dedicated portrait camera on the back and a better background blurring algorithm than Google&apos;s.</p><p>Finally, Nothing OS is a superb OS that I prefer over most flavors of Android. It not only has a unique dot matrix-like style but also features plenty of fun home screen widgets, great features, and three years of promised updates. Nothing regularly updates its OS with new features and security patches, too, so you never have to worry about feeling out of date.</p>

<p>In typical A-series fashion, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G manages to deliver excellent value for money. The smartphone features a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. Sure, the waterdrop-style notch has become a little long in the tooth at this point, but the screen gets pretty bright and works well for everyday usage.</p><p>Powered by the company&apos;s homegrown Exynos 1280 SoC, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. While these are not top-of-the-line specifications, they&apos;re more than enough for handling tasks like web browsing and some casual gaming. You even get an expansion slot that can take up microSD cards of up to 1TB in size, allowing you to carry pretty much your entire media library in your pocket.</p><p>The smartphone runs Android 14 (with Samsung&apos;s newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6" target="_blank">One UI 6</a> overlay) and will get up to four years of OS updates, as well as five years of security updates. That means you get Android <strong>updates until Android 18</strong>! This excellent update policy alone makes the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G one of the best Android phones in its price range.</p><p>Speaking of cameras, there&apos;s a triple-lens setup at the back with a 50MP primary unit, an 8MP ultra-wide module, and a 2MP macro sensor. The smartphone can shoot some decent images in well-lit conditions, but low-light photos are largely unimpressive. As you&apos;d expect, the macro lens is mostly useless and only exists to pad the spec sheet. Up front, there&apos;s a 13MP unit for all your selfies and video calls. The whole package is backed by a 5,000mAh battery that comes with 25W wired charging support.</p>

<p>If the picture above doesn&apos;t already clue you in, the Poco X6 Pro has looks to kill and the build quality to match. The yellow color looks particularly striking and elegant with its vegan leather back, and the AMOLED display on the front is among the very best you&apos;ll find on mid-range phones, much less in the sub-$300 price class.</p><p>Poco&apos;s choice of a fast processor, plenty of RAM, and fast UFS 4.0 storage mean this phone feels faster than most in its class, giving you plenty of power for multitasking and gaming, alike. The downside is that the processor is a little <em>too</em> powerful to run without a more expensive internal cooling solution, so the phone gets pretty hot during longer gaming sessions.</p><p>Thankfully, that powerful processor doesn&apos;t negatively affect battery life. Quite the opposite, actually! Our reviewer, Harish, said that the Poco X6 featured "standout battery life" with ultra-fast 67W wired charging support.</p><p>The Poco X6 comes with Xiaomi&apos;s HyperOS, built on Android 14, which sports plenty of convenient features, great UI design, and three years of promised updates. That means you&apos;ll see <strong>Android 16</strong> plus one additional year of security updates before you should consider upgrading again.</p><p>Lastly, the main camera is quite good but the remainder of the cameras aren&apos;t worth using at all—particularly that useless 2MP macro camera. We&apos;re still not sure why some companies feel like a 2MP camera is worth putting on any phone in 2024 but we&apos;d recommend just not using it.</p>

<p>For generations now, Google Pixel phones have been lauded for their excellent cameras that take the most consistently-good pictures around. That&apos;s largely in part to Google&apos;s incredible software, which utilizes an intelligent HDR+ algorithm that constantly takes photos, then combines several into one amazing picture automatically.</p><p>If you compare the spec sheet for this phone versus other cameras—even ones on this list—you&apos;ll probably wonder how a 12 megapixel camera could possibly outclass a 50MP or higher sensor. The answer is that Google doesn&apos;t need more megapixels to make a great picture, and that&apos;s all because of what I said in the paragraph above.</p><p>I&apos;ve regularly called Pixel phones the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-best-smartphone-camera-parents-heres-why">best phones for parents and pet owners</a> because of their ability to capture crisp images of objects in motion—in this case, that means the kids and pets that refuse to hold still for a photo.</p><p>But while the camera is best-in-class, you&apos;ll also be pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Tensor G1 processor inside the Pixel 6a. It&apos;s twice as fast as the processor in the Galaxy A25 above and can play games and multitask better because of it. Tensor is known for getting a bit on the warm side, though, so don&apos;t plan to play cutting-edge games for too long at a time.</p><p>The real downside to picking up a Pixel 6a at this point is that Android 15 is the last major OS update the phone will receive, as official OS updates end in July 2025. You&apos;ll still get two more years of security updates, at least, but know that the new features you get next Summer are the last new features you&apos;ll get.</p>

<p>When it comes to displays, few look as good as the one on the Redmi Note 13 Pro. This gorgeous 6.67-inch AMOLED panel features those deep blacks and vibrant colors AMOLEDs are known for, and it punches that second part up a notch with 12-bit Dolby Vision support.</p><p>If you love watching movies on your phone, this is the one to get as that display will deliver the most accurate colors, widest dynamic range, and plenty of brightness to see clearly even in bright sunlight. Better yet, Xiaomi outfitted the display with eye-friendly capabilities including TÜV Rheinland certifications for low blue light, circadian friendly, and even flicker-free thanks to DC-like dimming at high brightness and 1920Hz PWM dimming at low brightness.</p><p>On top of that display is super durable Gorilla Glass Victus, a type of glass you normally only find on phones hundreds of dollars more expensive. And last but certainly not least is Xiaomi&apos;s Wet Touch feature which makes it easy to use the touch screen even when your hands are wet. Try that with your current phone and you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s impossible to accurately type or swipe when water is on the glass.</p><p>While our reviewer Harish wasn&apos;t impressed with the phone when it launched in September 2023, Xiaomi has since updated the phone with Android 14, fixed tons of bugs, and the new lower price all come together to make this a significantly better value than it used to be.</p><p>While Xiaomi was very slow to update this phone to Android 14—seven months after the phone and Android 14 officially launched—the Redmi Note 13 Pro still gets two more years of OS and security updates, though, so Xiaomi has plenty of time to make up for the slow first platform update.</p>

<p>Motorola truly reinvented itself over the past year as it launched not only our favorite foldable phone ever, but also a line of budget-friendly phones that look and feel amazing. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is the perfect example of this, melding a stylus design glad in vegan leather, all while housing a lovely stylus inside the phone&apos;s svelte frame.</p><p>The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 processor inside isn&apos;t the fastest chip on this list, but it&apos;s still faster than the one found in the Samsung Galaxy A25 near the top of this list. Of course, the main draw of this phone isn&apos;t this performance though, it&apos;s the stylus house inside the body.</p><p>Motorola has a suite of software custom designed to work with the stylus, and although this isn&apos;t an active stylus like you&apos;ll find on more expensive Samsung phones that have stylus support, it&apos;s still nice to have one to jot down quick notes or annotate images and screenshots. Especially since it&apos;s always inside the phone waiting to be quickly used!</p><p>Motorola also upgraded the cameras this year, outfitting it with some surprisingly good image capture including an ultrawide-angle lens. Our reviewer, Derrek, was really impressed with the image quality and specifically lauded the phone for that feature.</p><p>While Motorola ships this one with Android 14 and its excellent Hello UX—complete with all our favorite Motorola gestures like double-chop to activate the flashlight—the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 will only get updated to Android 15, plus three years of security updates to ensure you feel safe online. If you don&apos;t care about tons of updates and want to prioritize a stylus, this is a great choice for under $300.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s no doubt that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> offer you an unmatched user experience — complete with features like top-tier cameras and wireless charging — these devices don&apos;t come cheap. If you can&apos;t (or just don&apos;t want to) spend thousands of dollars on a flagship phone, we suggest taking a look at one of the many options available under the $300 price point. Sure, these do miss out on some nice-to-have features found in expensive phones and aren&apos;t supported for long, but they cover all the basics, while also having some extras. So, before making your decision, do take a look at what features you need the most.</p><p>Our top choice is the CMF Phone 1, a brilliant pick at just $200 with an option to upgrade the RAM and storage for $80 more. Even at that price, it&apos;s still a better phone than any other on this list, including a bright and beautiful—but also eye-friendly—OLED display, a powerful processor, the second-best cameras on this list, and a unique modular design that you can 3D print parts for. It&apos;s an unbelievably fun phone that blew me away from the moment I tried it.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget about the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G if you&apos;re looking for some serious long-term value. While the processor isn&apos;t the fastest on this list, it has the longest software support promise of them all—5 years! That means it&apos;ll see Android 18 before Samsung drops support, something that no other phone on the list can claim. That&apos;s great if you like to hold on to your phones for a long time.</p><p>Lastly, if we&apos;re comparing affordable phones with those that aren&apos;t so affordable, we can&apos;t ignore the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024). This thing comes with a swanky vegan leather back panel and an integrated stylus that makes it look and feel extremely premium. There&apos;s even NFC support for contactless payments, another feature that&apos;s commonly found in flagship phones.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>
☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>
☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>

<p>Testing phones at Android Central involves much more than simply booting up a device to ensure it works. We can use phones with a consumer mindset because <em>we</em> <em>are consumers, </em>in addition to Android enthusiasts and product testers. Unlike some sites that rely solely on benchmark programs and lab tests to verify performance, we use smartphones in real-life scenarios to better understand how a device will perform during normal, day-to-day use. </p><p>This involves personally hitting the streets to see how a phone&apos;s camera will perform during the day <em>and </em>night, and comparing pictures from two devices side by side to see how they differ. Our testing involves running multiple performance-heavy apps simultaneously to see if a phone will overheat or swiftly lose battery life. It involves booting up graphics-intensive games at the highest settings to see if the images will lag or stutter, and it means draining the battery of a phone to zero to test the speed at which it will recharge. </p><p>This barely scratches the surface of every testing metric we apply to each new device, so check out our guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central">how Android Central tests and reviews phones</a> to learn more. </p>

<p>Reading your favorite book on an E Ink tablet is much easier on your eyes than a traditional tablet thanks to paper-like E Ink displays. The best E Ink tablets offer a mix of useful features beyond the purpose of just reading. You can use them for all sorts of things such as drawing, writing, listening to audiobooks, and exploring the internet.</p><p>The best E Ink tablet that offers all these features in one unified body is the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro, the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</a>. It has a large and beautiful screen that can display color and has writing functionality that delivers a satisfying pen-and-paper feel. As a bonus, it also has keyboard support! If you love the look and feel of traditional reading and writing mediums, this tablet will surely capture your heart. There are plenty more e-paper tabs out there, but the Tab Ultra C Pro gives you the most value for money and performs consistently well.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in this curious blend of traditional and modern mediums, I&apos;ve rounded off the best options available to you right now. As a certified book nerd slash geek (and proud of it), I have always been a huge fan of E Ink technology. The ability to carry hundreds and thousands of books around in a sleek tablet is the stuff seven-year-old me would have drooled over. Twenty years later, I&apos;m still drooling over the latest mind-boggling e-paper devices. My love for this branch of tech and my experience testing dozens of models from various brands are two very good reasons for you to trust my expertise.</p>

<p>While most E Ink displays tend to focus on doing one thing, the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro does it all. Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Tab Ultra C</a>, the Tab Ultra C Pro displays 4,096 colors on its 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display, which is unusual for most E Ink tablets. Thanks to the accompanying stylus, you can view in full color and even draw, highlight, or jot down notes in different shades. The Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s touch function for the stylus is powered by Wacom, the company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets">best drawing tablets</a>. It imitates the traditional blue feel of writing on paper with a pen.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox really took things to the next level by adding more gear under the Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s hood. This stunningly slim tablet runs Android 12 out of the box so that you can install and use apps from the Google Play Store. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of onboard storage, a microSD slot, a 16MP camera, stereo speakers, a mic, a USB Type-C port that supports fast charging, and a set of speakers. Amazingly, the 4,600mAh battery can last for a week or two with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in full use. The Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the complete package; it is almost a full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you want the complete package, you&apos;ll have to pay for it since this tablet isn&apos;t exactly cheap in comparison to "normal" tablets. It also lacks water and dust resistance, which is a bummer, and E Ink displays are famously dim in the sun. We believe you can live with these shortcomings as the combination of features in the Tab Ultra C Pro is just too good. Unlike competitors such as the Kindle Scribe, it provides more value and has so much more to offer.</p>

<p>For many years, Amazon has dominated the e-reader market with its Kindle line of reading tablets, and for a good reason: Kindle e-readers are excellent devices, and their displays have LED backlighting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Amazon Kindle e-reader</a>, which makes it the best E Ink tablet for reading.</p>
<p>The 2021 iteration of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has IPX8 waterproof certification, so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting it wet. It also has five adjustable LED backlights, so it&apos;s fairly bright in sunlight. Its 6-inch 300ppi E Ink screen is a delight to look at and replicates paper very nicely. Audible integration makes it the perfect companion for lazy beach days when you want to sunbathe with your eyes closed. You can connect a pair of Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and listen to audiobooks in peace.</p>
<p>Amazon introduced many different colors for the Kindle Paperwhite, so you have a lot of variety. There&apos;s 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, which is enough to store thousands of e-books. The battery life is excellent, and you get a USB-C charging port. Amazon sweetened the deal by setting a low price, but you&apos;ll need to spend a little extra cash for the ad-free version. If you&apos;re an avid reader, you won&apos;t be disappointed by the Kindle Paperwhite. Some file formats aren&apos;t supported, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazons-kindle-e-readers-will-finally-support-the-most-popular-ebook-format">Amazon did introduce EPUB</a> compatibility to compensate.</p>

<p>At $500, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C improves on the fantastic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a> by retaining its value-packed features but bumping the display to a colorful one. Onyx Boox tablets beat Amazon, Kobo, and every competitor easily because they all have the Google Play Store and run Android 12.</p>
<p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C has a 10.3-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display that can produce 4096 colors and has excellent contrast and a lovely crispness to it. It comes with a battery-free stylus that registers 4,096 degrees of pressure, and you get native optical character recognition (OCR). This is such a vital feature for any tablet, whether it&apos;s an e-ink device or a full-blown traditional Android or iOS tablet. You also get native OCR or handwriting recognition and conversion with the Note Air 3 C, something even the Kindle Scribe doesn&apos;t offer properly.</p>
<p>Apart from the stylus and excellent e-paper screen, the Note Air 3 C has all the advantages of e-ink tablets and e-readers, as well as a few extras. Its 3,700mAh cell provides weeks of battery life, and it has a USB-C port with OTG support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, support for tons of file formats, speakers, and even a microphone! You can even buy a keyboard case separately to enable typing input.</p>
<p>When looking for a writing tablet with an e-paper display, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C is easily the winning contender. This is saying something, considering the Note Air 3 C&apos;s foes include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-vs-remarkable-2">Amazon Kindle Scribe and the ReMarkable 2</a>. If you don&apos;t mind the lack of water resistance and the need to buy the keyboard case separately, this is the e-ink tablet to get for $500.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Onyx Boox Palma</a> is more of an E Ink smartphone than an E Ink tablet. It has a compact form factor enabling you to carry it around with you in your pocket. The sub-$300 price tag might feel a bit high for the size, and you could easily get a basic entry-level Kindle for less than half the price. However, no Kindle comes with the Google Play Store, which is only one of the many enticing draws of the Boox Palma.</p><p>The Boox Palma has a microphone, speakers, and all the fancy schmancy connectivity options that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">full-fledged Android tablets</a> have, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The only connectivity feature missing is cellular support really.</p><p>You get Android 11 and the Google Play Store pre-installed, granting you access to millions of apps. And because the device uses a B&W E Ink display, the battery literally lasts for months! The 128GB of native storage is insane, but if that somehow isn&apos;t enough for you, you also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">get a microSD card</a> slot and USB-C OTG support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-thumb-drives">USB-C thumb drives</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to find another handheld e-ink device that&apos;s this capable because honestly, there isn&apos;t one!

<p>E Ink tablet lovers out there on a budget can still get one for a nifty price. The entry-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle (2022)</a> is a budget e-reader sporting a 6-inch 300ppi e-paper display. It doesn&apos;t have many fancy features like a waterproof rating or Sudoku, but it can support a healthy number of file formats and looks brilliant.</p>
<p>It isn&apos;t that bright in sunlight, but the adjustable front light is handy for reading at night. The basic Amazon Kindle has some more no-nonsense specs like 16GB of storage, fantastic battery life, Wi-Fi, and audiobook support. If you don&apos;t want to use the Kindle app, you can transfer files to the Amazon Kindle (2022) e-reader from your PC.</p>
<p>In comparison to almost every other e-paper device out there, the Amazon Kindle is the winner, hands down, when it comes to price. The base model Kindle performs a tad bit slower, and it doesn&apos;t have waterproofing, but it is still the best E Ink tablet for reading on a tight budget.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox has ventured into all corners of the e-paper tablet world, giving us the tiniest of devices like the Boox Palma and the biggest of slabs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-x-review">Onyx Boox Tab X</a>. This gigantic 13.3-inch E Ink tablet doesn&apos;t display color, but the viewing experience is sublime nonetheless. This is the most premium Android tablet with an E Ink display made by the brand.</p><p>I tested the Tab X and was very impressed by its thinness and lightweight build. The tablet is quite literally as slim as a tea biscuit! And this narrow waist does not impede the tablet&apos;s performance in any way. Apart from that, the Tab X comes with all the signature features of Onyx Boox devices such as Android, the Play Store, a speaker, a mic, and a stylus.</p><p>If the 128GB of onboard storage isn&apos;t enough for all your documents, e-books, graphic novels, and apps, then the USB-C OTG feature should help you expand the storage even further. There&apos;s no microSD slot, but that shouldn&apos;t be a big issue all things considered. The one major drawback here is the morbidly expensive price tag. If you can afford it, you won&apos;t have much to complain about.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honorable-mentions"><span>Honorable mentions</span></h3>
<p>There are so many more wonderful e-paper tablets that didn&apos;t make the cut as the top six. However, there are some honorable mentions that deserve to be named at the very least. If you need something extremely niche and are interested in expanding your options even more, here are a few noteworthy extras to consider.</p>

<p>A niche tablet with limited functionality may seem too rich for your blood, but wait until you write on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">ReMarkable 2</a>. This is the best premium tablet built for writing, setting the industry standard for stylus sensitivity and feel. It's really expensive, which is why I didn't deem it worthy enough to rank among the top six E Ink tablets. However, it's a good product in itself.</p></p>

<p>An E Ink tablet with a color display for less than $300? No, you're not dreaming. The cheap and cheerful Bigme B751C Color makes this possible, getting you a 7-inch E INK Carta 1200 display with a stylus, Android 11, and a microSD slot at an agreeable price. The UI isn't as smooth or intuitive as Onyx Boox, but the low price demands some compromise.</p></p>

<h2 id="the-best-all-around-e-ink-tablet-is-multifunctional-2">The best all-around E Ink tablet is multifunctional</h2>
<p>After staring at bright screens day in and day out, your eyes really need a break. The best E Ink tablet not only provides relief but also allows you to carry out various tasks. Pick one based on your specific needs. If you intend to read basic ebooks, an entry-level e-reader should be fine. But, if you intend to do more like drawing and taking notes, take your use cases into consideration before making a final choice.</p><p>The Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the best E Ink tablet owing to its fabulous soft colors, extremely sleek and lightweight build, and multitasking capabilities. It isn&apos;t limited to just being an e-reader, but if you want, you can use it for that purpose. But if need be, you can also use it to take down notes, sketch some lovely drawings, or underline passages of text.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s also not forget that you get native optical character recognition with the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro, enabling you to convert your handwriting into digital text in real-time, whether it&apos;s to use the search bar in the Google Play Store or to use the search function in your handwritten notes. This alone is a remarkable feat for any decent tablet with a stylus.</p>
<p>The Tab Ultra C Pro accommodates office use as well as home use. You don&apos;t have to sacrifice battery life or connectivity. It even has stereo speakers and a mic, which no other electronic ink tablet on this list offers. What&apos;s even more brilliant is its ability to run almost any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android app</a>. You can actually use it as a full-fledged tablet for most tasks related to reading and writing. The Tab Ultra C Pro pushes the boundaries of an E Ink tablet in the best sense, which is why it is the best one you can buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>A top OnePlus executive has confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> will debut in China next month, featuring the latest high-end mobile processor.</p><p>Traditionally, OnePlus drops its flagship phones in December for the Chinese market, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-earlier-fall-launch-rumors">things are changing this year</a>. Louis Lee, OnePlus China’s president, announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/Ow9ZyvUb7" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 13 is set to launch a bit ahead of schedule—this October (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/09/oneplus-13-release-date-performance-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Along with the surprise October launch, Lee also shared some juicy details about the upcoming handset. It’s going to run on the newest flagship processor with a custom design from the same team behind cutting-edge PC chips. This means a new dual-core setup that&apos;s set to blow away the competition and set new industry standards, according to a machine translation for Lee&apos;s post.</p><p>That’s likely the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, set to be revealed in October. With the timing aligning so neatly, it’s almost a sure bet that the OnePlus 13 will be the first phone to flaunt this new powerhouse.</p><p>Anyway, unlike its predecessor, which saw the light of day in December 2023 and went global in January of this year, the next-gen device is making its debut much earlier.</p><p>The upcoming Qualcomm processor features custom Oryon CPU cores, the same tech that was used in its Snapdragon X PC chips.</p><p>According to Lee, the OnePlus 13 might be able to handle the demanding graphics of Genshin Impact at a high refresh rate of 120fps.</p><p>Rumor has it OnePlus&apos; next contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> will up its camera game with three 50MP sensors on the back, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">including one with 3x optical zoom</a>. Plus, it’ll keep teaming up with Hasselblad for that extra photography flair.</p><p>Notably, this camera system echoes the stellar setup on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra, so expect some top-notch photography.</p><p>Earlier leaks have already given us a sneak peek at the OnePlus 13’s features. We’re looking at a revamped camera design, a huge 6.8-inch 2K screen, and a hefty battery over 6,000mAh.</p><p>No matter what the final specs are, we won’t have to wait long to find out since the launch has been moved up by a couple of months.</p>
