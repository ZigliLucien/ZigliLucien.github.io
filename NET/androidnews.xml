The Galaxy Ring is now on sale in the country, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/rings/galaxy-ring/galaxy-ring-titanium-black-size-10-sm-q500nzkainu/">costs ₹38,999 ($465)</a>, $65 more than what it retails for in the U.S. To put things into context, the Galaxy Ring costs ₹2,000 ($25) more than the LTE-enabled variant of the 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, which can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/watches/galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch7-44mm-green-lte-sm-l315fzgains/buy/">bought for ₹36,999 ($442)</a> right now.</p>

<p>I don't really understand who Samsung is targeting with its smart ring, and while the Galaxy Ring marks the brand's introduction into a new segment, I don't think the brand is likely to find many takers in India. The Galaxy Ring costs too much in the country, and there's also the small matter of it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">not being a good product</a>. Samsung says the cost of its products are determined by marketing after due research, but the fact remains that the Galaxy Ring has a hefty premium over its rivals.</p><p>Indian customers tend to be tech-savvy in general — a by-product of the population skewing younger — and while Samsung has a massive userbase in the country, there's just not enough on offer with the Galaxy Ring to entice many buyers. The smart ring is able to track daily activity and sleep, but the accuracy of the data is in line with a budget fitness band, and doesn't measure up to regular smartwatches — the Galaxy Watch 7 does a much better job at just about every metric.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key differentiator of the Galaxy Ring is that it's an "invisible" wearable; it's not as cumbersome to wear as a smartwatch while still delivering useful health and activity metrics. If Samsung came out with the Galaxy Ring two years ago, then it would have been a different situation, because as it stands, there are better products that offer the same features and don't cost anywhere as much.</p><p>I'm partial to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>. I wore the smart ring through most of 2024, and while fitness monitoring is inconsistent, it consistently delivered usable insights. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/in/">coming in at ₹25,469 ($305)</a> as of writing, it significantly undercuts the Galaxy Ring. Noise is a dominant brand in India's budget wearable segment, and it has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/noise-luna-ring-review">Luna Ring</a>; it isn't particularly great, but if all you need is a smart ring that shows activity data, it is a decent choice — and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.lunazone.com/products/luna-smart-ring">just ₹21,999 ($263)</a>.</p><p>Both products have their shortcomings, and if you want a smart ring with accurate activity monitoring, Amazfit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Helio Ring</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://in.amazfit.com/products/amazfit-helio-ring">available in India for ₹24,999</a> ($300). My colleagues did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-ring-hr-accuracy-test">extensive testing of smart rings</a>, and the Helio Ring's heart rate measurements proved to be the most consistent of the lot.</p><p>Samsung touts the seamless integration with other Galaxy devices, but right now, you don't get much in the way of features. And while the brand positions AI as a differentiator, it doesn't do enough with the basics to make it stand out.</p><p>It's telling, then, that the Galaxy Ring is sold out in sizes eight through 13 just a few days after availability — Samsung likely brought a very limited inventory of smart rings to the country. It's clear that smart rings are set to become a new revenue driver for the brand, and I'm crossing my fingers that a second-gen model of the Galaxy Band does more to justify the asking price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There&apos;s no shortage of choice if you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS</a>, and you don&apos;t have to rely on conventional HDDs either — all-flash NAS servers are gaining momentum, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">F8 SSD Plus</a> is a terrific showcase in this area. But what if you need a portable option, one that&apos;s tailored to work on the go?</p><p>You can get an SSD enclosure, slot in a drive, and connect that to your phone, and while that is a decent alternative, you don&apos;t get much in the way of features. That&apos;s where UnifyDrive&apos;s UT2 comes in; the NAS is designed to be a truly portable solution, and it comes with the ability to back up photos and videos from your phone, easily make that data accessible on your home network, and even back up SD cards.</p><p>While UnifyDrive is a new entrant in this category, the UT2 gets a lot right from the get-go, and having used the NAS for just over a month, I think it is a great choice if you need a reliable way to back up data while traveling.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-pricing-and-availability"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZCUAen8iugHAdNYHvDxjJQ" name="unifydrive-ut2-11.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 back view with M.2 slots covered" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCUAen8iugHAdNYHvDxjJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive is crowdsourcing the UT2, with the NAS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1945743381/ut2-redefining-portable-storage-solutions">available on Kickstarter</a>. The UT2 is slated to retail for $599 when it starts general availability, but during the crowdfunding phase, you can pick it up for $399 — a $200 discount. The project has received $695,062 in funding as of writing, and UnifyDrive notes deliveries will start going out from November 2024.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-design"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4MzKB7tPs8h8uGCABnPpmN" name="unifydrive-ut2-7.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 profile view highlighting the design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4MzKB7tPs8h8uGCABnPpmN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive did a good job with the design of the UT2, and the NAS has a design that&apos;s similar to an external HDD — albeit bigger. There&apos;s a silicone case that gives much-needed protection to the chassis, and the diminutive design means the UT2 doesn&apos;t weigh much, coming in at just 350g.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Xhrh82ExS4JDpPf3Kc6xGN" name="unifydrive-ut2-9.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 side view showing vents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xhrh82ExS4JDpPf3Kc6xGN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a vent on the side to deliver passive airflow to the innards, and the UT2 can hold two M.2 2280 SSDs. The drive slots are located on the underside, and the drive cover has a slotted design to prevent overheating. The design is refreshingly utilitarian, and the size along with lightweight nature of the UT2 makes it highly convenient to take anywhere. It is roughly the same dimensions as a 20000mAh power bank, but doesn&apos;t weigh as much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JDowSSaNg7XojYmbZfhgnQ" name="unifydrive-ut2-13.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JDowSSaNg7XojYmbZfhgnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the size, you get an exhaustive selection of ports. The UT2 comes with a dedicated USB-C port to power the device and charge the internal battery, and there&apos;s a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port along with HDMI 2.1 connectivity. The HDMI port is a great addition, as it allows you to connect the NAS to a TV — UnifyDrive even bundles a remote with the UT2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7gksUvRwaCKXStCNJHbpmP" name="unifydrive-ut2-12.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 showing connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gksUvRwaCKXStCNJHbpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side, you get a USB-C port, CFexpress slot, standard SD card slot, and a USB-A port. The connectivity gives the UT2 a sizeable advantage over traditional external drives, and the fact that you can add up to 16TB of total storage — 8TB in each M.2 slot — makes it highly enticing. I didn&apos;t see any usability issues with the UT2; the NAS doesn&apos;t overheat even under load, and the silicon cover does a great job protecting the chassis.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-features"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KM4GU5CrgjBKHEuPmKrcmL" name="unifydrive-ut2-2.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL showing device stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KM4GU5CrgjBKHEuPmKrcmL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UT2 has a decent set of features, and what I like the most about the device is the ability to easily back up SD cards with a single button. Just slot in an SD card, hit the PlugBackup button twice, and it will start backing up the contents of that card. It is a nifty use case, and one I utilized extensively in the month I tested the UT2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hTudYenb8RvKwDg7VUJJnM" name="unifydrive-ut2-4.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL with device M.2 details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTudYenb8RvKwDg7VUJJnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can set up the UT2 with the UnifyDrive app on Android, and it has a clean design and comes with a ton of useful features. Considering UnifyDrive is a new entrant, I figured it would have a basic mobile utility, but that isn&apos;t the case at all. You can easily access the data on the NAS, back up photos and videos on your phone to the NAS, monitor system and memory use, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uBbc6ad2ob5sKaVbV3n2KM" name="unifydrive-ut2-3.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL showing available utilities" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBbc6ad2ob5sKaVbV3n2KM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The exhaustive control is a definite edge, and UnifyDrive deserves credit for getting this right on the initial try. Similar to every other NAS server, you can access the data via SMB — this is how I moved data to and from the NAS with my Windows machine — and there&apos;s a flash drive mode that effectively turns the UT2 into an external drive.</p>
<p>In flash drive mode, data is partitioned into exFAT so it can be readable as a drive on Windows and macOS machines, and what&apos;s great about this mode is that you can set the amount of storage you want to be accessible. Again, this is a feature that&apos;s thought out well, and you get all the other usual connectivity options to access data on your home network, including DLNA, WebDAV, NFS, and so on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GBJ2S6LFBFpTynuohzA6eS" name="unifydrive-ut2-5.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 built-in battery settings on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBJ2S6LFBFpTynuohzA6eS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The UT2 comes with a built-in battery that safeguards data; it automatically kicks in when you remove the power connector, and you can set shutdown limits. The battery lasts under 90 minutes, and that&apos;s more than enough if you need to transfer photos during a shoot.</p>

<p>UnifyDrive didn&apos;t leave anything out when it comes to the hardware, and the UT2 is powered by a Rockchip platform that has four Cortex A76 cores combined with a quartet of A55 cores clocked up to 2.4GHz. There&apos;s a Mali-G610 that has six shader cores, and 32GB eMMC flash memory. You get 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM, but it is soldered, and there&apos;s no way to increase memory down the line.</p><p>The dual M.2 2280 slots are based on the Gen 3 standard, and UnifyDrive bundled two 500 WD SSDs with the package for testing — the retail bundle doesn&apos;t include any storage. I didn&apos;t run into any issues when transferring data to the built-in SSD, and I got bandwidth similar to that of other all-flash NAS devices I tested.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7N7KzZdNTRuivxffCR8jHP" name="unifydrive-ut2-6.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 NAS next to Pixel 9 Pro XL showing device stats" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7N7KzZdNTRuivxffCR8jHP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port is a welcome addition, and it allows you to slot in the NAS in a home setting with ease. There&apos;s also Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and you get the option to set up the UT2 as a hotspot. It holds up well as an external drive when using the flash drive mode, and as I mentioned before, the ability to back up SD cards with the press of a single button is just convenient.</p><p>There are several features missing; UnifyDrive is adding a feature that lets you back up the contents of the NAS to a cloud server, and a built-in music player and e-reader aren&apos;t available as of writing.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS" name="terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-3.jpg" alt="TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus side view with logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqXWNTysQbC7cyBpB2THdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>UnifyDrive has a unique product in the UT2, and there isn&apos;t another NAS that does quite as much and is designed to be portable. If you need a good all-flash server to use in your home, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">TerraMaster&apos;s F8 SSD Plus</a>. It has eight M.2 slots, 10GbE connectivity, and better software features. But you don&apos;t get any portability with the NAS.</p><p>If you need a way to back up data on the go, an external SSD is still the best way, and I recommend Crucial&apos;s X10 Pro. I used this drive for the better part of a year now, and it has been reliable.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-unifydrive-ut2-should-you-buy-it"><span>UnifyDrive UT2: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UXoiQFBVqVnMnmwxHWJRcT" name="unifydrive-ut2-14.jpg" alt="UnifyDrive UT2 connectivity and power ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UXoiQFBVqVnMnmwxHWJRcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a portable NAS to back up your phone data</li><li>You need a reliable way to back up SD cards</li><li>You want a NAS that doubles as an external drive</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a robust feature-set</li></ul>
<p>The idea of a portable NAS is highly alluring, and to its credit, UnifyDrive delivered the basics. The UT2 makes it easy to back up data, and the inherently portable design gives it a definite edge. You get all the connectivity options you could ask for, and the hardware itself is powerful — rivaling that of home-based NAS devices.</p><p>The biggest differentiator is its ability to back up SD and CFexpress with a single button, and the built-in battery allows it to be used on the go without any hassle. It holds up just as well as a home NAS thanks to 2.5GbE connectivity, and if you need an all-flash server that you can use on the road to back up photos and videos, the UT2 is a great overall choice.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has officially announced the "Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition."</li><li>It features a 6.5-inch cover screen, along with an 8-inch inner display, while being both thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</li><li>Pre-orders are set to kick off in South Korea on October 25, with a starting price of 2,789,600 won (~$2,035).</li><li>It's currently unknown whether the Z Fold Special Edition will come to more markets.</li></ul>
<p>Just a few days ago, Samsung finally acknowledged that it was set to release a new foldable phone. And now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition has been officially announced.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ea%b0%a4%eb%9f%ad%ec%8b%9c-z-%ed%8f%b4%eb%93%9c-%ec%8a%a4%ed%8e%98%ec%85%9c-%ec%97%90%eb%94%94%ec%85%98-%ea%b5%ad%eb%82%b4-%ec%b6%9c%ec%8b%9c-2">press release (translated)</a>, Samsung wastes no time in pointing out the improvements between this model and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The Z Fold Special Edition is both thinner and lighter than its predecessor, as it&apos;s "1.5mm thinner and 3g lighter." However, those aren&apos;t the only two improvements that Samsung has made. </p><p>The cover screen and main display are both larger, coming in at 6.5-inches and 8-inches, respectively. As a result, both screens are also now a bit wider, which is something many hoped Samsung would implement with the Z Fold 6. Especially considering how other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> have adopted the wider cover screen, making it less cumbersome to do anything besides scroll social media or quickly reply to messages. </p>

<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-gets-a-launch-date">Z Fold Special Edition</a> is powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, it features 16GB of RAM, as opposed to 12GB. This comes as little surprise given the influx of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that we&apos;ve seen introduced in the past year, as it should offer a bit more performance and reliability when using those features.</p><p>Samsung has yet to share the entire list of specs for the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition but has one more trick up its sleeve. The outdated 50MP sensor from the Z Fold 6 has been replaced by a 200MP wide-angle lens, "supporting more vivid and clear photos and videos."  </p><p>Seeing as this is a "Special Edition," Samsung is opting to go with only one color option — Black Shadow. The company says that the combination of "the striped pattern and metal/glass materials provide a modern and sophisticated design."</p>

<p>There are a few things that Samsung didn&apos;t mention about its latest device, such as whether it will still support an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen</a>, along with any potential battery improvements. We&apos;ll likely have to wait until the phone becomes available for purchase before learning everything about this model. </p><p>In terms of price and availability, the Z Fold Special Edition is priced at 2,789,600 won (~$2,035), and pre-orders are set to kick off on October 25. There is a catch, however, as it appears that Samsung is only selling this phone in the company&apos;s home country of South Korea. </p><p>There&apos;s no mention or indication as to whether it will see a global launch or even arrive in other markets. </p>

They're fantastic, seamless options for passive health data, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">surprisingly decent at step counts</a> if you ignore the false positives from gestures. But for fitness tracking, pretty much every brand we've tested has given less-than-accurate results, to put it mildly.</p><p>So when Oura sold its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> as a better fitness option, with its Automatic Activity Detection and improved real-time HR data during workouts, I bullied our Oura reviewer into going for a run and working out to test this claim for himself.</p><p>Our managing editor Derrek Lee is building a real collection of smart rings now, with the Oura Ring 4, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2</a>. I asked him to work out while wearing each, compared against smartwatches that we've tested with reliable optical heart rate accuracy, and see how close the smart rings came to a proper result.</p><p>I also slipped on my Ultrahuman Ring Air to see how it performed, while including the fitness test we performed during our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring review</a>. Here's what we learned!</p>

<h2 id="why-testing-smart-ring-accuracy-is-so-hard-2">Why testing smart ring accuracy is so hard</h2>
<p>Before I show the results, I'll point out that this test won't be as detailed and graph-happy as my previous fitness tests, like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap fitness watch accuracy test</a> or my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Garmin v. Coros v. Polar flagship</a> showdown.</p><p>Why? Most smart ring apps (besides Amazfit's Zepp Health) don't have the tools to export heart rate graphs for specific workouts, like you can with established fitness watch brands. We tried to export Oura's GPX files from Derrek's Strava account and it made my usual HR graph tool <em>crash</em> every time I tried to upload it.</p><p>Plus, some of these smart rings don't even let you trigger a manual workout unless it's a specific type, like walking or running. For some brands like RingConn, we had to trick the app by saying Derrek was "running" during a gym workout to have it save his heart rate data. Without a workout mode, smart rings don't sample your heart rate frequently enough for the results to be at all helpful.</p><p>Point being, I'm mostly making these comparisons based on heart rate averages and eyeballing HR graphs from slapdash manual workouts. But don't worry: It's still enough data to show how middling most of these smart rings are for fitness.</p>
<h2 id="testing-smart-ring-heart-rate-accuracy-during-workouts-2">Testing smart ring heart rate accuracy during workouts</h2>
<p>For this smart ring fitness accuracy test, Derrek ran once and completed four gym workouts, wearing two watches — the Garmin Venu 3 and Pixel Watch 3 — and three smart rings from Amazfit, Oura, and RingConn. These were the results:</p>

<p>Without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">proper chest or arm strap</a>, I can't say for certain whether the Venu 3 or Pixel Watch 3 was more accurate for Derrek; the Venu 3 did very well in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">my review</a> compared to a COROS band, while I gave the Pixel Watch 3 a "B" for accuracy in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">its review</a>, generally extremely accurate but struggling in the 160+ bpm range. Still, you can see that both match each other fairly closely, as a benchmark for what wrist-based optical sensors typically offer for accuracy.</p><p>Now compare these three smart rings' massive gap in results. You'll see that only the Amazfit Helio Ring is consistently accurate — especially if we flip a coin and assume Google is more accurate than Garmin here. Its averages are very much on point, and while its max-HR data falls short, it's not <em>as</em> underestimated as Oura or RingConn.</p><p>It's not perfect, of course. You can see in the two heart rate graphs below that it falls well short of Garmin for an extended stretch once Derrek's heart rate reaches certain heights; in the second graph, it's always close but tends to show small valleys where Garmin peaks. But overall, it's closer than I expected from any smart ring.</p>

<p>Oura doesn't do badly for low-aerobic workouts in the 100–130 range, but the higher Derrek's heart rate climbed, the more difficulties the Oura Ring 4 had. In the last workout, the heart rate chart showed a massive 60–70 bpm gap for most of the workout.</p>

<p>RingConn's stats are so far off that Derrek speculated that the issue might be that he was forced to wear it on his ring finger instead of his usual index finger (he only has so many fingers, after all), leaving it too loose for a proper reading. That might explain the issue, so we can give RingConn a tentative pass here, while still keeping the data for now.</p>

<p>I will point out that if you wear a smartwatch too loosely or too tightly, your results will be skewed, too...but not <em>this</em> much. It goes to show how important a smart ring's fit is for proper results.</p>
<p>Nick and I own the Galaxy Ring and Ultrahuman Ring Air, respectively, with no other smart rings. So our tests are more straightforward, showing how they compare against our smartwatches of choice.</p>

<p>Nick already wrote about the Galaxy Ring's fitness struggles in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">review</a>: The Pixel Watch 2 and OnePlus Watch 2 averaged 170 and 169 bpm during a hard Spartan Race; the Galaxy Ring averaged under 150 bpm, randomly splitting the race across two activities.</p><p>As for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, it still lists its Workout Mode as in Beta about half a year after I finished my review, and the results are still wonky. Unlike other smart rings that severely underestimate your active heart rate, Ultrahuman told me my heart rate average was 182 bpm for a track workout when Garmin said it was 168 bpm. A couple of days later, it told me my average during a light run was 153 bpm; Garmin registered 143 bpm and said 153 bpm was my <em>max</em>.</p>
<h2 id="does-smart-ring-fitness-accuracy-matter-2">Does smart ring fitness accuracy matter?</h2>
<p>As I said from the beginning, most athletes won't buy a smart ring specifically for workouts. Runners and cyclists want a watch for its GPS and screen data, and while you can lift weights while wearing a smart ring, it can distract from your grip and get scratched up unless you attach a silicone cover.</p><p>Still, even if people don't expect a smart ring to be perfect, they want <em>ballpark</em> accuracy so they can keep track of burned calories. And since brands like Oura and Ultrahuman try to estimate your VO2 Max or Cardio Capacity, it's important that they do so with accurate data instead of inadvertently misleading people.</p><p>I came into this test assuming that the new Oura Ring would sweep away the competition, but you know what they say about assuming! Instead, it's the Amazfit Helio Ring that won the hardware accuracy contest. And since Amazfit recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-gets-permanent-price-drop-and-free-subscriptions">discounted it to $199</a> and made its pricey subscriptions free, the Helio Ring has become more appealing.</p><p>On the other hand, the Helio Ring has unresolved problems like the limited number of sizes (three), short battery life (four days), and lack of automatic workout detection. You might still prefer an Oura Ring with its middling accuracy because you don't have to manually start a workout in the app every time you run or lift weights.</p><p>In other words, all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> have work to do on the fitness front, but maybe they're close enough for everyday athletes not to mind the accuracy gaps. Either that or they'll just keep using their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> instead and only use smart rings for health and sleep data.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google recently made Chrome for Android even better on the accessibility front. Now, you can listen to web pages while doing other things, thanks to a nifty upgrade for the "Listen to this page" feature.</p><p>This update, which was first announced last month as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-september-2024-feature-drop">September Android Feature Drop</a>, makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">fan-favorite browser</a> more user-friendly and accessible. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/chrome-listen-page-background-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Chrome 130 is now bringing background playback support for the "Listen to this page" feature to Android users.</p><p>The background playback feature first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-on-android-to-support-background-playback-for-read-aloud/" target="_blank">popped up</a> in June after a low-key rollout, and it was kept under wraps as an experimental flag. Before this update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome for Android</a> would only read web pages aloud when the app was open. You could switch tabs, but if you left the browser or locked your screen, the audio would stop if Chrome wasn’t in the foreground.</p><p>The latest update finally tackles this issue. Now, the browser will keep playing audio even if you turn off your screen or switch to another app. When you do switch, the article will show up as a media player in your notification panel, complete with easy play/pause and 10-second skip/rewind buttons.</p><p>On top of that, the media player in your notifications will highlight the article's headline and website. If you want to tweak the playback speed or change the voice, you’ll have to hop into the playback widget within Chrome itself.</p>

<p>As always, you can adjust the audio speed to fit your vibe. There’s a bunch of voice options to pick from, too.  Plus, you can set Chrome to highlight the text as it reads and scroll through the content, so it’s easy to keep up.</p><p>Just like the name implies, Listen to this page uses text-to-speech to read articles and web pages out loud in Chrome. When you turn it on, a handy mini-player shows up at the bottom of the screen for easy access.</p><p>You can quickly access the feature from Chrome's three-dot menu. If you use it a lot, you can add a handy shortcut right by the address bar. Just head to the Toolbar shortcut settings in Chrome and choose "Listen to this page."</p>

Google also surprised us by releasing both the Android 15 update <em>and</em> the October Pixel Feature Drop at the same time.</p><p>With that, we can enjoy even more features than what we initially expected. Although this isn't a roundup of everything new in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, we've already done that, these are the 9 features that I've been enjoying since receiving the update.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-app-archiving"><span>App Archiving</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RyVW86LVFbXfiXJYAUPhfK" name="app-archive-notifications-pixel-9-pro.jpg" alt="Amazon app archive notification on Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RyVW86LVFbXfiXJYAUPhfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know you have a problem when you see an interesting app you want to try out, only to realize that you have already downloaded it. I deal with this more often than I'd like to admit. Another part of the problem is that I tend to run out of space fairly quickly, but I don't want to delete any apps from my phone.</p><p>Android 15's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-built-in-app-archiving-feature">App Archiving feature</a> is something that I never really thought I would have a use for, but it's become rather indispensable. The best part is that this feature isn't limited to just apps from the Play Store. Instead, you can archive almost any app on your phone, regardless of whether it was downloaded from the Play Store or from a third-party repository like F-Droid.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-tap-passkey"><span>One-tap Passkey</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1294px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="k9ZrK3dDpFXtoVCxoho7TW" name="1password-existing-users-gain-passkey-support-android.jpg" alt="1Password is rolling out passkey support for all existing users on Android 14 and above." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9ZrK3dDpFXtoVCxoho7TW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1294" height="728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 1Password)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I haven't had the greatest experience with Passkeys, as I still prefer relying on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a> with codes being generated by my password manager. Part of the problem has been the less-than-seamless experience whenever logging into a Passkey-enabled account.</p><p>For the most part, Android 15 has solved a bit of this for me, as signing in with a Passkey now only requires a single tap. Sure, it's only one less step than before, but when you're trying to quickly sign into something, the wasted time adds up.</p>

<p>Recently, I was able to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-saw-the-northern-lights-for-the-first-time-thanks-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">Northern Lights for the first time</a> thanks to using Astrophotography mode on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. However, one of the frustrations with using this at any time, and not just trying to capture a specific event, is that the conditions needed to be <em>perfect</em> in order for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> to be activated.</p><p>Previously, the only options were to either turn it off or set it to "Auto," which was fine when your Pixel decided to let you use it. Thankfully, that's no longer a problem with Android 15, as you can now manually enable it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-home-controls-on-the-lock-screen"><span>Home Controls on the Lock Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've written more than a few words about how I believe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> was released as a public beta test for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-not-nest-hub-replacement">redesigned Nest Hub</a>. Android 15 adds further credence to that idea, thanks to the new Home Controls screen saver. When activated, all of my Google Home toggles and controls are just <em>there</em>.</p><p>Hopefully it's not a bug, but this is also an option on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, which came as a nice surprise. Another surprise is that I'm able to swap out Google Home for my Home Assistant dashboard, which gives me even more control over my smart home. Not to mention that you're able to customize Home Assistant to your liking, and aren't limited to just controlling your "favorites."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-pin-the-taskbar"><span>Pin the Taskbar</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.68%;"><img id="bUZqn9PmE8qP4UKF2mAY6j" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-multitasking-bar.jpg" alt="Taskbar on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUZqn9PmE8qP4UKF2mAY6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1667" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who loves tablets and foldable phones, I was rather surprised when the Pixel Fold didn't include the ability to pin the Taskbar. This is something that Samsung introduced back with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>,and is also an option with the OnePlus Open. Despite that, it's not currently an option on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> for reasons that I can't explain.</p><p>Android 15 should solve that problem once it makes its way to more tablets and foldables. On either the Pixel Tablet or Google's foldable phones, slowly swipe up to make the taskbar appear, long-press it, then tap the toggle to "Always show Taskbar."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-go-from-the-big-screen-to-the-small-screen"><span>Go from the Big Screen to the Small Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N" name="continue-using-apps-settings-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Continue apps on cover screen settings panel on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCjLTjsmraBP7RKK4F4x7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although I've been using foldable phones since the Galaxy Z Fold 2, one feature that I constantly forget about is being able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-samsungs-continue-apps-feature-between-your-galaxy-phone-and-tablet">continue using an app</a> from the inner screen on the cover screen. It's one of those things that can come in handy when you want but isn't a "defining" feature of the user experience.</p><p>Nevertheless, it's also something that wasn't available with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> on the Pixel Fold, despite being an option on Samsung's foldables and the OnePlus Open. On Android 15, it can be enabled under the "Display & touch" settings, and from there, you can choose to always have apps appear, perform a swipe-up gesture, or turn this off entirely.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-keeping-apps-together"><span>Keeping apps together</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk" name="split-screen-apps-on-pixel-9-pro-fold.jpg" alt="Split-screen multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPAY9T9qMoxUh4BjGcnUMk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't believe it took Google this long to bring App Pairs to its Pixel devices, but I'm sure glad it's here. Using two apps side-by-side is already incredibly helpful, as it lets me use something like Chrome on one half and Keep or Obsidian on the other.</p><p>However, it was rather annoying not being able to save that combination and use it later. Once Android 15 is installed on your foldable or Android tablet, open two apps side-by-side, then swipe up to reveal the app switcher. From there, tap the <strong>Save app pair</strong> button, and a new icon will appear on your Home Screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-gemini-improvements"><span>More Gemini improvements</span></h2>

<p>As Google continues to improve Gemini, one thing that I've been hoping for is deeper integration between apps. The latest update does just that, as it's now possible to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and ask it questions about items within the Pixel Screenshots app.</p><p>Although it's probably not something that I'll use on a regular basis, I'm just happy to see more functionality being added to Gemini.

<p>As someone who owns almost as many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> as smartphones, switching between them has been quite a pain. Previously, I'd have to jump into the Settings app, head into the Bluetooth menu, and then select the headphones that I want to switch to.</p><p>Android 15 makes life easier, in this regard, courtesy of the updated Quick Settings tile. Now, I can just tap the toggle and pick from the list of available headphones. This is great for when I want to go from using my over-ear headphones at my desk to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p>

<p>These are just a handful of the new features that are now available with the stable release of Android 15. There are so many more that might appeal to others, even if they don't really resonate with how I use my phone on a daily basis.</p><p>If you just received the update, I highly recommend diving into the Settings app. Just take a look at all of the different screens, panels, and toggles, so that you can better feel for what your phone is actually capable of.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3">Manifest v3</a> rules for Chrome Extensions seem to have everyone up in arms because the popular ad-blocker extension Ublock Origin was pushed out. Of course, social media and discussion groups are full of comments stating this was the purpose of the changes, and since Google is an ad company of course they want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">ban all ad blockers</a>. neither is true.</p><p>It's also not true that Ublock Origin doesn't work; I'm using it right now even though I was told it doesn't function. What is true is that Chrome extensions have some new rules to follow, which Google says are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/improving-security-and-privacy-for.html">designed to increase security and privacy. </a>Nobody believes them.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, Manifest v3 is a response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dataspii.com/">DataSpii</a>. DataSpii was described as a catastrophic data leak from Chrome and Firefox users who had certain extensions installed that were able to stay within the old set of rules but harvest user data ranging from Tax Returns to credit information. It was pretty bad.</p><p>Changes like preventing remote code from downloading or running and changes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest">WebRequest API</a> make it much more difficult for this to ever happen again. It will happen again but not for the same reasons or in the same way. Again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">not everyone agrees</a> that these changes are helpful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="B2pW9JhqxFB2Rvf5yoo9Gh" name="best-chrome-extensions-2020-hero.jpg" alt="Best Chrome Extensions 2020 Hero" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2pW9JhqxFB2Rvf5yoo9Gh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unless you write Chrome extensions, none of this matters to you. Your concern is that extensions you've come to depend on may stop working. That hasn't happened yet, but it might.</p><p>I mentioned that I'm still using Ublock Origin without any issues; I simply had to turn it back on in Chrome's settings. Because this goes against Google's perceived best security practices, I won't tell you how to do that, but you can easily Google the answer and do the same. I think this is one of those times where if you didn't know how to manage extensions yourself, you're better off using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en">Ublock Lite</a> anyway. That's not me being elitist (flipping a toggle on a settings page is hardly elite behavior), but I think some people are better off not messing with things. You know people like this if you aren't one of them yourself, and there is no shame in it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.93%;"><img id="S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV" name="ublock" alt="Extension management" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7hegeBbXDGL6rmLzBtsAV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="410" height="217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the changes that prompted all of this — they were necessary... at least some of them. It's hard to believe that Google was OK with any extension running outside code that was never reviewed as long as it did, but it happened. I wanted to understand how extensions worked a while ago, so I wrote a couple of very complicated ones to display Photospheres stored in Google Photos and depended on the fact that I could host scripts that ran remotely. I don't have the same experience as someone who builds extensions regularly, but I know enough to understand why some of these changes are a good idea.</p><p>Will this kill off the next great idea? Maybe. I can't see the future, but if an idea comes along that would break the rules, someone could still write it for Firefox or Microsoft Edge. If Google continues to allow older extensions to run, users could install the unpackaged version in Chrome using developer mode. I wouldn't let this stop me from developing something I wanted to share with the world, even if very few people would ever be able to use it.</p><p>Ad blockers are a must. I know I work for a company that loves to place ads everywhere, but I would advise you never to browse the web without the protection of an ad blocker and a tracking cookie blocker because not only is the experience bad, but it can also point you towards malware. Don't do it. Use Ublock Lite and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Privacy Badger</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ghostery-tracker-ad-block/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en" target="_blank">Ghostery,</a> and you'll be glad you did. Install them, use the default settings, and turn them on if nothing else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN" name="Pi-4-logo.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFm38nhC7it8P3mYHaHFZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to go a step further, use a fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nordvpn.com/features/threat-protection/ad-blocker/">VPN that blocks ads</a> or build your own hardware-based device like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-ads-pi-hole-raspberry-pi">Pi-Hole</a>. Or heck, do all three if you want. Just don't surf the web without some sort of insulation against the ads. You could even switch browsers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">use Firefox</a> because almost every website supports its engine with no issues.</p>
<p>What not to do is pay attention to things that tell you the sky is falling. It's not. This is a case where another tech company is doing something that hurts developers or forces them to do extra work. We see that every day and should be glad that developers are willing to do that work and continue to provide the tools we need.</p><p>Focus that energy and outrage on the fact that it's 2024, and Chrome for Android <em>still </em>doesn't support extensions, which is far worse.</p>

Users will be able to experience full-color illustrations with faster page turns and better image quality than a traditional Kindle.</p><p>For readers who like highlighting things, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition will also allow users different color highlighter options, which should spice up your reading a bit and help organize your thoughts.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is available for preorder now and will ship on October 30.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is finally rolling out Circle to Search on some of its phones months after the feature was a Samsung and Pixel exclusive.</p><p>Google's powerful AI assistant, which first launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series in January, quickly made its way to Pixel phones and other Galaxy models. Earlier this year, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-coming-to-more-android-phones-in-october">teased that the feature would soon roll out to more Android devices</a> by October 2024.</p><p>In September, Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/googles-circle-to-search-might-soon-break-out-of-its-pixel-and-galaxy-bubble">made waves by launching its first devices</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature. Not long after, Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">revealed plans to bring the feature to its Magic V3 foldable and Honor 200 series</a>. Now, Motorola is jumping on board too.</p><p>While Motorola’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-is-redefining-the-mobile-experience-with-new-experiences-powered-by-google/" target="_blank">press release</a> confirmed that Circle to Search is coming to select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Moto devices</a>, it left out one key detail—exactly which models will get the feature.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Motorola to confirm which devices will support the AI feature, and we’ll update the article as soon as we get a response.</p><p>Since other brands have been selective with Circle to Search, it’s probably safe to say that only a handful of Motorola models will get it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">2024 Razr</a> foldables look like strong contenders, but we might see some inconsistencies in how this feature rolls out across Motorola’s lineup.</p>

After identifying the object, it instantly pulls up relevant search results.</p><p>Along with Circle to Search, Motorola announced that select devices will also support Rich Communication Services (RCS), Gemini Live, and the new AI features from Google Photos.</p><p>This rollout comes shortly after Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">introduced a new proof-of-concept that merges Large Action Models (LAM) with Moto AI's capabilities</a>, allowing your phone to understand your surroundings and tackle complex tasks just by having a natural conversation with it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You've come to the right place if you need to know how to set the IPD on Meta Quest 3S. Setting the correct inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is one of the key pillars of having a good VR experience. When your IPD is set incorrectly, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It can also make it difficult to slice blocks accurately in Beat Saber because your brain can't deduce the proper distance between objects.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>'s IPD adjustment method is quite different from other VR headsets on the market, so we've put together this guide to help you find your ideal IPD preset as well as some hidden tricks to enable additional IPD settings. If you have a Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2), these steps will also work for that headset.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-ipd-2">How to measure your IPD</h2>
<p>In order to measure your IPD, you'll need two things: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Westcott-Non-Shatter-Ruler-Inches-13862/dp/B00309RVJ6/">ruler with millimeter markings</a>, and a mirror. Any ruler will work so long as it has millimeter markings, but you will want a hard ruler instead of a flimsy tape measure to ensure accuracy.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While looking in the mirror, <strong>close your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight into the mirror at your right eye <strong>with your right eye</strong>.</li><li>Hold the ruler just below your eye and center the <strong>zero marker</strong> on your right pupil.</li><li><strong>Close your right eye</strong> and <strong>open your left eye</strong>, making sure to not move the ruler.</li><li>Look into the mirror at your left eye <strong>with your left eye</strong>.</li><li>Look straight and <strong>note the millimeter distance</strong> that matches up to the center of your left pupil.</li></ol>

<p>For example, my IPD is 66mm. The average IPD sits around 63mm, but can range between 55mm and 72mm (or higher) depending on the person.</p>

<p>Now that you have your IPD measured, you can accurately set the IPD on your Meta Quest 3S. You'll do this by physically sliding the lenses closer or further apart from one another. The Meta Quest 3S features three presets for IPD adjustment: preset 1 is 58mm, preset 2 is 63mm, and preset 3 is 68mm. By default, the Meta Quest 3S ships at IPD preset 2, which covers the average IPD.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Determine which preset works best for you using the measurements you wrote down earlier.</li><li>The closest preset is <strong>58mm.</strong> The middle preset is <strong>63mm.</strong> The furthest apart preset is <strong>68mm</strong>.</li><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray cover </strong>on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong>, or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2 id="what-if-my-ipd-doesn-t-match-the-presets-on-meta-quest-3s-2">What if my IPD doesn't match the presets on Meta Quest 3S?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB" name="Meta-Quest-3S-lenses-angle" alt="Looking at the lenses inside a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5TbKFZYw8FCZsRWoQQGNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If your IPD isn't exactly 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm, don't worry. Meta has designed the lenses on the Meta Quest 3S to help fit a range of IPD, but while one of those presets will fit nicely for most people, some folks will find they need a setting in between.</p><p>The trick is to gently move the lenses between presets and stop somewhere between the preset point.</p>
<ol start="1"><li>While holding the Meta Quest 3S, <strong>grab ahold of the gray plastic</strong> on the outside of one lens.</li><li>Gently push the lens in toward the other to <strong>lower IPD</strong> or push them apart to <strong>raise IPD</strong>.</li><li>Try to <strong>push just past</strong> preset 1 or preset 2 to get a more accurate IPD.</li><li>If you're having trouble pushing past, try pushing the lenses inward <strong>from a higher IPD preset</strong> instead.</li></ol>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S still only supports a maximum IPD range of 58-68mm, but using the spaces between presets can help folks who have IPD between the numbers. For instance, someone with an IPD of 60 or 61 might try the space between preset 1 and preset 2. Someone like me who has an IPD of 66 can try the space between preset 2 and preset 3 for a more comfortable experience.</p>
