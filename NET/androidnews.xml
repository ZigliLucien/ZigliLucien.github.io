The proof is in the pudding with these AMVR Quest 3 controller grips that are mainly designed to add grip and a hand strap, making it fast to change out the battery or use another Quest 3 controller accessory temporarily.</p><p>The secret is in the Quest 3 controller&apos;s ingenious battery door design which clips in and is only released with the press of a button. AMVR Quest 3 controller grips slot in place of the standard controller battery door, adding a lovely grippy texture and easily adjustable hand straps to make throwing objects in VR easier.</p><p>The hand straps are quickly adjustable via a velcro backing, and the ribbed texture on the grip surface helps keep hands cool even during long sweaty play sessions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>.</p>

<p>The original release of this controller grip was defective but AMVR quickly replaced those with a refined version that doesn&apos;t break easily. I&apos;ve been using them for months and have yet to find any structural issues, so I&apos;m confident that the original problems have been fixed.</p><p>My favorite part about these grips is how simple it is to remove them when necessary. You won&apos;t be changing out batteries very often since the Quest 3 controller battery life lasts weeks on end, but I often play Walkabout Mini Golf with friends and love putter accessories like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">HelloReal Putter</a> or this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Attachment-Compatible-Accessories-Controller/dp/B0CP1MH1J6/">AMVR Quest 3 golf club</a>.</p><p>Both require you to remove the grips to fit snugly inside the club attachment, and it&apos;s nice to just pop the grips off with a single button press and slide the controllers into the golf club.</p>

<p>AMVR also sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Protector/dp/B0CJF9QKZ5/">another controller grip</a> that completely covers the controller, if you prefer that. These are also good and add a similar hand strap to make throwing easier, but require more work to take off in case you want to use other accessories.</p><p>For me, though, simple is best. That&apos;s why I prefer the regular AMVR Quest 3 controller grips and why I call them one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. Of all the ones I&apos;ve tested so far, this is my favorite way to play.</p>

<p>For years, the Garmin Forerunner 245 was Android Central&apos;s #1 pick thanks to its reliable health and location tracking, along with tools like Garmin Coach that keep you on the right training path. Then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> took its place with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-vs-245">key upgrades</a> like heart rate variability, all-systems multi-band GNSS, and new widgets like a Morning Report and Race Widget that made training planning easier.</p><p>I bring up these watches first because the Garmin Forerunner 265, our pick for the best runners watch, is only a "prettier 255," as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">my review</a> described it.</p><p>You&apos;re getting the same experience for $100 extra, in terms of analyzing your form, performance, and heart health to help recommend your future workouts and recovery times. Both are fantastic devices, and when you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-vs-255">Forerunner 265 vs. 255</a>, the latter has 95% of the same tools.</p><p>So why do I recommend the Forerunner 265? Because the 416 x 416 AMOLED display is significantly more readable than the memory-in-pixel (MIP) displays on most running watches. The 265 is beautifully bright and ensures using your watch indoors isn&apos;t an eye-straining chore. It also lowers the battery life compared to bulkier Forerunners, but 20–24 GPS hours is still above average.</p><p>We also appreciate its one exclusive upgrade over the 255: Training Readiness. An update to the Body Battery stat, it uses HRV status, sleep data, and acute load to measure your muscles&apos; recovery time in addition to your body&apos;s overall energy. So you&apos;ll never be told to run when your body is sore, just because you slept well.</p><p>Ultimately, this is one of the most comprehensive watches for self-guided runners to improve their PRs and VO2 Max scores. The Forerunner 965 is better, but the 265 has a slightly more reasonable price and has all the core tools most runners need.</p>

<p>Shopping for the best running watch doesn&apos;t automatically mean you need to spend a fortune. The Amazfit Cheetah Pro comes with core features like built-in GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, sports apps, energy monitoring, and stress tracking. It trades off features like NFC, but it has all the essentials for a much lower price than most running smartwatches.</p><p>As our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Cheetah Pro review</a> explained, the lightweight Amazfit smartwatch packs plenty of value for money. You get extremely accurate GPS tracking, Alexa onboard, the ability to answer calls on your wrist thanks to the mic and speakers, as well as local music storage. The wearable can last for around two weeks on a single charge, so the battery life is excellent.</p><p>Apart from all the necessary health and fitness tracking sensors, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro also comes with the brand&apos;s proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-amazfit-zepp-coach">AI Zepp Coach</a>. Just like any decent Garmin watch, it uses AI to create a recovery plan and helps you understand how much rest time you need between workouts.</p><p>If you want to go even cheaper, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-round-vs-cheetah-pro">Amazfit Cheetah Round</a> is a stripped-down version of the Cheetah Pro with almost the same features. It&apos;s a decent cheap alternative to consider.</p>

<p>Most people are happy enough with a watch that lasts one day under normal circumstances, while last-gen running watches often only lasted 10-20 hours with GPS tracking enabled, or relied on solar panels to last longer. The COROS APEX 2 can last a whopping 45 hours per charge, ensuring it&apos;ll never die on you even if you start a workout with low battery levels.</p><p>COROS is a popular brand among many runners, and in recent years it has developed significant software tools like an EvoLab for measuring training effect and recovery time and a Training Hub for getting training plans to improve your times. If you&apos;re only familiar with Garmin watches, you shouldn&apos;t sleep on the APEX 2, which gives the Forerunner 265 a run for its money (no pun intended).</p><p>It has a titanium frame and sapphire glass, giving the APEX 2 a more premium appearance than most plastic-heavy running watches (like most Garmin watches). Otherwise, I appreciated that it has both a touchscreen and digital crown for whichever type of navigation you prefer, though some runners will prefer Garmin&apos;s specific Up and Down buttons to a dial.</p><p>The APEX 2 has blood oxygen and ECG detection — though you can only spot-check this information rather than run it continuously. And it uses all-systems GNSS tracking, meaning it relies upon multiple satellite systems at once to detect your positioning more exactly, in case your signal is blocked from a specific direction.</p><p>Technically, the better option for battery life is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">COROS APEX 2 Pro</a>, which lasts a whopping 75 hours per charge and offers other "pro" upgrades like increased storage and dual-frequency GPS tracking. But we recommended the APEX 2 over the Pro in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">review</a>, noting that it&apos;s a better deal for its lower price point. COROS lowered the APEX 2&apos;s price after launch, making it $100 less than the Forerunner 265 at full price. </p>

<p>When we first reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Garmin Forerunner 955</a>, we called it the "best runner&apos;s watch, period." Since then, the Forerunner 265 and 965 have complicated the discussion. I&apos;m currently reviewing the Forerunner 965, which (like the 265) is a more expensive 955 with an AMOLED facelift. Keep that in mind when you&apos;re making your choice; but until that review goes live, the 955 is still my recommendation.</p><p>The Forerunner 955 is a bigger but more polished version of our former top pick, the Forerunner 255. Its bulky design comes partially from its impressive battery (42 GPS hours is nearly unmatched, aside from the COROS APEX 2 Pro) and a 1.4-inch MIP display. </p><p>I especially loved its Training Readiness perk during my review period, but now Garmin is bringing the tool to other Forerunner and Instinct watches. Still, the Forerunner 955 has other exclusive features, starting with a real-time stamina bar that shows your estimated energy left so you don&apos;t overtrain. It also tells you how quickly you&apos;re acclimating to high heat or altitude, taking that data into account for workout suggestions.</p><p>It has a whopping 32GB of storage for both music and maps — including preloaded topographical maps, golf and skiing maps, and room for uploaded GPX maps, which more adventurous runners will find incredibly useful. You can see Strava Live Segments on your wrist during a run, or if you choose a route in advance, the Climbpro feature will preview what kind of elevation gain to expect moving forward. </p>

<p>Most of the best running watches put much more stock in running coaching and health data than traditional "smartwatch" features that require a battery-guzzling processor. But some runners really don&apos;t want to compromise on smarts and will accept a shorter battery for better functionality. In that case, pay close attention to the Samsung Galaxy Watch series.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic</a> sport an Exynos W930 chipset with 2GB of RAM for silky-smooth performance and app support that most other runners&apos; watches can&apos;t offer. That includes Wear OS apps like Strava, Adidas Running, Nike Run Club, and so on; you can directly access these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> instead of having to export data to them from apps like Garmin Connect.</p><p>Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic watches have a gorgeous super AMOLED display with a touch bezel for scrolling through menus, with a physical rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. And they all share a bevy of health sensors that measure everything from your heart&apos;s health and rhythm to your overall body composition (aka fat and muscle percentage) and blood oxygen.</p><p>You get the same all-day battery life on both Watch 6 series devices as their battery specs are the same. Where other Wear OS watches and the Apple Watch could die after just a few hours of GPS tracking, the Galaxy Watch 6 is much more dependable to handle that, continuous HRM, music storage, and so on without instantly dying. Unfortunately, the tradeoff for this battery life is that it&apos;s hard to get past just how heavy this watch is as a runner used to lighter devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> we&apos;ve tested, giving you plenty of perks <em>outside</em> of fitness to enjoy, while still giving plenty of perks for casual runners striving to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Some people run for the joy of running; others because it&apos;s the simplest way to get your heart and body healthier. If health is your main concern, or if you spend as much time in the gym as hitting the pavement, you may want to opt for a Fitbit instead. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> is the more affordable watch, or you could switch to a tracker like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-charge-5-review">Charge 5</a> instead. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit</a> for health tracking is the flagship Fitbit Sense 2.</p><p>The Sense 2 comes with one of the widest ranges of health sensors available, tracking your heart rate, rhythm, and variance, blood oxygen, and skin temperature. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>, you&apos;ll get various reports on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a>, overall health, stress levels, health trends over the last 90 days, possible issues like fevers or AFib, and other useful tools and scores.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2 review</a> explains the many perks that come with this model, starting with the attractive "squircle" design with AMOLED touchscreen and the new side button that replaces the finicky capacitive button of the original Sense. Its reliance on a touchscreen makes it less reliable than button navigation when your fingertips get sweaty, but it&apos;s undoubtedly a lighter, more attractive watch for casual wear outside of runs. And you&apos;ll get good everyday mileage out of tools like tap-to-pay, Amazon Alexa integration, and even Google Maps support.</p><p>In terms of fitness features, you get essentials like heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, automatic exercise recognition, on-screen workouts, and female health tracking. And you&apos;ll love Active Zone Minutes, which shows the time you spend in fat burn, cardio, or break heart-rate zones.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any super-advanced features here as far as running is concerned, and the six-day battery life doesn&apos;t match other options on this list. Plus, it only has 5 hours of estimated GPS tracking, well below the other options on this list — plenty for casual runners who won&apos;t run longer than an hour or so, but not enough for all-day tracking.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose-the-right-running-smartwatch-for-your-needs"><span>How to choose the right running smartwatch for your needs</span></h3>
<p>When shopping for the best running watch, there are several factors to consider, including your battery life needs, feature preferences, and budget. Most dedicated runners will find the Garmin Forerunner 265 to be their best option, whether you prioritize price and battery life or display quality and the latest software. Regardless, Garmin watches give you great running guidance at no extra charge.</p><p>Before you choose your running watch, make sure that you&apos;re committed to using that software to amp up your running performance and endurance. Otherwise, you may just want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">traditional smartwatch</a> until you&apos;re sure you are committed. A Galaxy Watch gives you the essentials, and lets you export data to popular third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> where you can get useful maps and analysis. </p><p>Not everyone needs a watch that lasts for weeks, since it could mean missing out on smarter tools or more attractive designs. But if you want something on the other end of the spectrum, anything from a COROS to a Fitbit could give you the health and fitness focus that you want.</p>

They also tested how the LLMs did when removing specific capabilities like memory or deductive reasoning, to see how it affected the results. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3SDTM62CYLaRU24BVSqPP9" name="Google-Werewolf-GDC-2024-panel-3.jpeg" alt="A slide during the GDC 2024 panel "Simulacra and Subterfuge: Building Agentic 'Werewolf'".

<p>The Google engineering team was frank about the experiment&apos;s successes and shortcomings. In ideal situations, the villagers came to the right conclusion nine times out of 10; without proper reasoning and memory, the results fell to three out of 10. The bots were too cagey to reveal useful information and too skeptical of any claims, leading to random dogpiling on unlucky targets.</p><p>Even at full mental capacity, though, these bots tended to be too skeptical of anyone (like seers) who made bold claims early on. They tracked the bots&apos; intended end-of-round votes after each line of dialogue and found that their opinions rarely changed after those initial suspicions, regardless of what was said. </p><p>Google&apos;s human testers, despite saying it was a blast to play Werewolf with AI bots, rated them 2/5 or 3/5 for reasoning and found that the best strategy for winning was to stay silent and let certain bots take the fall.</p><p>As Friedhoff explained, it&apos;s a legitimate strategy for a werewolf but not necessarily a fun one or the point of the game. The players had more fun messing with the bots&apos; personalities; in one example, they told the bots to talk like pirates for the rest of the game, and the bots obliged — while also getting suspicious, asking, "Why ye be doing such a thing?"</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7eWLrETnF2gn7QvuSVfN98" name="Google-Werewolf-GDC-2024-panel-4.jpeg" alt="A slide during the GDC 2024 panel "Simulacra and Subterfuge: Building Agentic 'Werewolf'".

<p>That aside, the test showed the limits of the bots&apos; reasoning. They would give bots personalities — like a paranoid bot suspicious of everyone or a theatrical bot that spoke like a Shakespearean actor — and other bots reacted to those personalities without any context. They found the theatrical bot suspicious for how wordy and roundabout it was, even though that&apos;s its default personality.</p><p>In real-life Werewolf, the goal is to catch people speaking or behaving <em>differently than usual</em>. That&apos;s where these LLMs fall short. </p><p>Friedhoff also provided a hilarious example of a bot hallucination leading the villagers astray. When Isaac (the seer bot) accused Scott (the werewolf bot) of being suspicious, Scott responded that Isaac had accused the innocent "Liam" of being a werewolf and gotten him unfairly exiled. Isaac responded defensively, and suspicion turned to him — even though Liam didn&apos;t exist and the scenario was made up. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s AI efforts, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, have become smarter over time. Another GDC panel showcased Google&apos;s vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gcd-2024-google-pushes-devs-toward-genai-living-games">generative AI video games</a> that auto-respond to player feedback in real-time and have "hundreds of thousands" of LLM-backed NPCs that remember player interactions and respond organically to their questions. </p><p>Experiments like this, though, look past Google execs&apos; bold plans and show how far artificial intelligence has to go before it&apos;s ready to replace actual written dialogue or real-life players. </p><p>Chen and Friedhoff managed to imitate the complexity of dialogue, memory, and reasoning that goes into a party game like Werewolf, and that&apos;s genuinely impressive! But these LLM bots need to go back to school before they&apos;re consumer-ready. </p><p>In the meantime, Friedhoff says that these kinds of LLM experiments are a great way for game developers to "contribute to machine learning research through games" and that their experiment shows that players are more excited by <em>building</em> and teaching LLM personalities than they are about playing with them. </p><p>Eventually, the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">mobile games</a> with text-based characters that respond organically to your text responses is intriguing, especially for interactive fiction, which typically requires hundreds of thousands of words of dialogue to give players enough choices. </p><p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> with NPUs capable of AI processing could deliver speedy LLM responses for organic games, that could be truly transformative for gaming. This Generative Werewolf experiment is a good reminder that this future is a ways off, however.</p>

<p>Whether it&apos;s a review unit or a Chromebook I&apos;ve purchased for myself, the first thing I do after signing in is to make sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-update-chromeos">ChromeOS is up to date</a>. Your Chromebook should automatically do this whenever it&apos;s connected to Wi-Fi, making periodic checks and downloading available updates so you don&apos;t have to. But when you first get a ChromeOS device, you want to make sure you have access to all the latest features from the get-go.</p><p>Really, it&apos;s something that I recommend doing, no matter what kind of device you just picked up. </p><p>This way, I don&apos;t have to worry about trying to use a feature that I was using before, only to find that it&apos;s not there because the software is outdated. This also goes for any Android apps, so I fire up the Play Store and install any potential updates that are in waiting.</p>
<h2 id="review-my-apps-and-extensions-2">Review my apps and extensions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uEQBAr4qFKJnokD7EuzAGS" name="lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-productivity-launcher-16x9.jpg" alt="App Drawer on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEQBAr4qFKJnokD7EuzAGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing you might have learned about me over the years, it&apos;s that I love installing and messing around with different apps. The same goes for Chrome extensions, albeit to a lesser extent. </p><p>I mean, Chrome already eats up all of my RAM as it is, and I don&apos;t need it getting worse. That being said, I go through my app drawer and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-manage-apps-your-chromebook">uninstall any apps</a> that I no longer need. What&apos;s the point of taking up space if it&apos;s something I&apos;ll never use? However, you should also be sure to remove or install Chrome extensions so that you can get the most out of your browsing experience.</p><p>Again, reviewing installed apps is something you should do on any device, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, which often come preinstalled with plenty of bloatware.</p>
<h2 id="linux-is-a-must-have-2">Linux is a must have</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozhw2qkcVbGRtMbTypuYTC" name="linux-pixelbook-go-hero-1-16x9.jpg" alt="Terminal app open on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozhw2qkcVbGRtMbTypuYTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to the fact that a Chromebook is really just a Linux laptop, Google makes it incredibly easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">install and run Linux apps</a>. In doing so, this gives me access to more powerful applications than what I would find on the Play Store or on the web. One such example is being able to install GIMP for editing photos or Obsidian for writing articles and taking notes.</p><p>And don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s actually much easier than it sounds.</p>
<h2 id="switch-to-a-different-channel-2">Switch to a different channel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V6RYcJF9T2zXqpCzTiZ9z" name="chromebook-plus-framework-laptop-chromebook.jpg" alt="Chromebook Plus upgrade on the Framework Laptop Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V6RYcJF9T2zXqpCzTiZ9z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the next section, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-switch-your-chromebook-developer-channel">switching from the Stable channel</a> on your Chromebook is <em>not</em> something that I recommend everyone else do. And by this, I mean the Beta or Dev channel, which provides access to new or upcoming features or those that might still be early in development. Part of why I do it can be blamed on my masochistic mentality when it comes to being on the "bleeding edge" of apps and software. </p><p>At the same time, doing so opens the doors for me to see and mess around with new features that might end up trickling down into the Stable build of ChromeOS. But again, it&apos;s not for the faint of heart, and one bad update could leave you with a mountain of frustration.</p>
<h2 id="tinker-with-flags-2">Tinker with flags</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gioRoE5fmvDKcF4ky9cxi4" name="google-chrome-flags-hero-landscape.jpg" alt="Chrome flags on Chromebook Duet and Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gioRoE5fmvDKcF4ky9cxi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, this one takes a bit of trial and error, but I <em>love</em> looking through the never-ending list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-flags-chrome">ChromeOS flags</a>, which are often the ways that you access many of the hidden, in-development features before they become more publicly available. It&apos;s definitely a "your mileage may vary" kind of situation, as some features could work while others might not. </p><p>Plus, depending on what Channel you&apos;re on, flags might appear that give us a glimpse at future ChromeOS features. At the same time, a really cool feature could show up only to be taken away with the next update, so you should always take what you see with a grain of salt.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-phone-hub-2">Set up Phone Hub</h2>

<p>I cycle through just about as many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> as I do Chromebooks. Because of that, it&apos;s a pretty good assumption that I&apos;m using a different phone by the time a new Chromebook arrives. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-phone-hub-on-chromebooks">Phone Hub</a> is an essential part of my daily workflow, and I need to make sure it&apos;s ready to go when I am.</p><p>Being able to view anything that comes through my phone from my Chromebook saves me time and helps me stay focused on whatever I&apos;m doing. Not to mention, recent updates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> make it incredibly easy to transfer files and photos back and forth without waiting for them to be uploaded to Drive or Photos.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-cloud-storage-2">All the cloud storage</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1992px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="SGSWmPTwbz8AvRz9TGpWT" name="Google Drive for desktop on Acer Chromebook Spin 514.jpg" alt="Google Drive for desktop on Acer Chromebook Spin 514" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGSWmPTwbz8AvRz9TGpWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1992" height="1121" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of my biggest complaints about Chromebooks, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-models-now-available">Chromebook Plus</a> models, is that there just isn&apos;t enough built-in storage. Obviously, these are supposed to be cloud-first computers, but after setting up Linux and installing Steam, it&apos;s just not enough. Maybe it&apos;s mostly a "me" problem, and that&apos;s fine, but there are bound to be other Chromebook owners who feel my pain.</p><p>However, I&apos;m also very thankful that Google makes it possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-microsoft-office-chromebook">use OneDrive</a> in addition to Google Drive. Between those two cloud storage solutions, I essentially have access to 4TB of storage on top of whatever size hard drive the Chromebook has. It&apos;s not a perfect solution, but it&apos;s still something.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-perks-2">Check for perks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3tMMQomu3yf3AKXqzigGVj" name="acer-chromebook-spin-713-kitchen-table-16x9.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 713 on table with Chromebook Perks landing page open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tMMQomu3yf3AKXqzigGVj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the time, your new and shiny Chromebook comes with quite a bit more than whatever&apos;s in the box. Through the Explore app, there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ll find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-are-google-chromebook-perks">a few freebies</a> that are included. Most of the time, there will be a perk for three months of YouTube Premium or an additional 100GB of cloud storage through Google One. </p><p>But occasionally, something even better will come through the pipeline, such as a free GeForce Now trial or a discount code for a new app. At the very least, it never hurts to at least check and see what you could get for free.</p>
<h2 id="install-steam-2">Install Steam</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4QcDu3mvgq8BstXcdCwPBD" name="framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review-hades-steam-up-close.jpg" alt="Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition playing Hades on Steam with SteelSeries controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4QcDu3mvgq8BstXcdCwPBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know that this doesn&apos;t really make much sense, given that I can just fire up GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass to play a lot of my favorite games. However, even more than a year after being officially released, I still can&apos;t get over the fact that I have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/play-steam-games-chromebook">Steam on my Chromebook</a>, which is a great way to play games on a machine that obviously wasn&apos;t built for it.</p><p>No, I still can&apos;t play games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Helldivers II. Thankfully, there are still enough great games that <em>will</em> run on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. And for those that don&apos;t, well, that&apos;s where cloud gaming services come into play.</p>

<p>We all might have our own gripes about Chromebooks and ChromeOS as a platform. But, there&apos;s no denying that it&apos;s continued to grow in both form and function. If you had told me five years ago that there would be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/frankenstein-framework-chromebox">Chromebook with interchangeable parts</a>, I probably would have laughed at you.</p><p>What makes this evolution even more incredible is that it was done without Google releasing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/see-ya-later-pixelbook-2">updated version of the Pixelbook</a>. Instead, Google is putting the hardware development into the hands of different laptop makers. However, at its core, Google is still steering the ship with ChromeOS.</p><p>If you just purchased your own Chromebook, hopefully my first steps can help guide you in setting up your machine just how you like it.</p>

<p>As Qualcomm just announced the Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 for the masses, OnePlus has finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/ace-3v">introduced</a> a device featuring the same chipset, dubbed the OnePlus Ace 3V.

A 5500mAh battery powers the OnePlus Ace 3V, and it supports 100W super-fast charging.</p><p>On the design front, OnePlus has opted for a full-glass design by featuring a curved glass design on the rear. The back panel further appears different from the previous Ace/Nord phones with a new camera visor. It equips a primary 50MP Sony IMX882 sensor accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens. These cameras support 4K video at 60/30fps. The punch hole on the front carries a 16MP selfie shooter. </p><p>The punch hole display on the front is an AMOLED panel measuring 6.74 inches.

Go pick up a TicWatch Pro 5 before the sale ends on March 25th and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYS4KJV6"><strong>you&apos;ll save an outstanding 35%</strong></a> on your purchase, a discount that returns the watch to its lowest price <em>ever</em>. </p>

<p>The TicWatch Pro 5 is great for folks who love a big smartwatch, with a reliable Snapdragon processor, up to 80 hours of battery life, and a comprehensive suite of reliable health and fitness tracking technology. You also get the popular Essential Mode feature to conserve battery life and a Gorilla Glass construction with 5ATM/IP68 protection, basically ensuring that this watch will keep on ticking no matter where you are. </p>
<p>Pick up the TicWatch Pro 5 during the Amazon Big Spring Sale and you'll get a straight 35% off. That's the biggest discount that the smartwatch has ever received from the retailer!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYS4KJV6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="75a8f34d-6320-4281-aaab-bb04fc4b8b71" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349.99" data-dimension48="$349.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want a big smartwatch with military-grade durability and outstanding battery life. </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you have small wrists; you want Google Assistant or the latest Wear OS updates. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the TicWatch Pro 5 is "a beast of a smartwatch", combining excellent Wear OS performance with a clever design and battery life to stunning effect. There&apos;s a rotating crown with haptic feedback that is simply a joy to use, and the Pro&apos;s "Essential Mode" means that you&apos;ll still be able to utilize the watch&apos;s basic functions when it&apos;s low on juice. That feature alone could have earned the TicWatch Pro 5 a spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, but the bulky frame and lack of Wear OS 4 integration have given us considerable pause.</p><p>Still, if you&apos;d like a larger watch with multiple days of battery life and all of the software features you could ever need, the TicWatch Pro 5 is a great choice, especially when you pair it with a massive 35% discount.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung announces it has rebranded One UI&apos;s old "Game Launcher" on Galaxy phones to "Gaming hub for mobile."</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-gaming-hub-for-mobile-discover-and-play-instantly-on-galaxy-phone/">press release</a>, the rebrand brings Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Android phones</a> closer to the Gaming Hub users will find on its smart TVs and monitors. The Gaming Hub gives users access to "Instant Plays," which is a feature the original launcher had since it was available.</p><p>Samsung highlights the feature, stating mobile gamers will find "immediate access" to titles without downloading them. Instant Plays is still in a "limited" beta with a few select games for those in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Moreover, the Korean OEM states its mobile game streaming hub supports native Android APKs, existing in-game monetization models for gaming publishers, and cloud-based solutions for developers.</p><p>The hub&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/gaming-hub/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">official page</a> details familiar features, such as the ability to manage downloaded games, alerts for exclusive gaming perks, and coupons.</p><p>Samsung discussed furthering its ambitions in streaming mobile games for Galaxy users at the Gaming Developer Conference (GDC 2024). The company&apos;s corporate vice president, Jikhan Jung, stated, " Our vision for Gaming Hub for mobile is to provide an all-in-one gaming platform optimized for Galaxy owners that makes playing and discovering games much easier without downloading and waiting."</p>

<p>Samsung first announced its original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub">Gaming Hub</a> for larger displays during CES 2022. The game-streaming discovery platform for smart TVs and more supports Xbox, GeForce Now, Utomik, and Amazon Luna. Users can seamlessly connect a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub#:~:text=SAMSUNG%20GAMING%20HUB%3A-,SUPPORTED%20CONTROLLERS,-(Image%20credit%3A%20Nicholas">supported gaming controller</a> to stream popular games to their TVs without needing a console.</p><p>While this may not be mentioned, Galaxy users who are hopping into the Gaming Hub should still find controller support.</p><p>Samsung didn&apos;t specifically list anything new arriving for its Gaming Hub for mobile rebrand. However, the hub notably piggybacks off some AI gaming software for curated recommendations on its home screen. Perhaps there&apos;s more in store as the company continues to "innovate" on its game-streaming platform.</p>

<ul><li>A recent Google Keep version shows the company's plans to introduce a revamped toolbar to the app.</li><li>The floating, pill-shaped toolbar takes up less space and offers users three options: create a note, a list, and a drawing or picture note.</li><li>While the new toolbar takes up much less space, it will also remove a couple of options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s notetaking app, Keep, has started a test involving a redesigned bottom bar for users.</p><p>As detailed by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Keep-New-Bottom-Toolbar.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), Google is seemingly dropping the bottom UI toolbar in Keep in favor of a floating, pill-shaped alternative (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/google-keep-floating-bottom-bar/">9to5Google</a>). The latest test was discovered in Keep&apos;s recent 5.24.102 version. Surfacing the bar in Keep&apos;s code on Android showcased the new bar&apos;s three options: open a new note, create a list, and create a drawing or picture note.</p><p>This toolbar supposedly utilizes your Android phone&apos;s Dynamic Theme, meaning it will feature your desired color palette. The deep dive also showed that the plus icon for starting a new note features a neat animation when tapped.</p><p>While the new bar could be seen as a way of taking up less space on your display, Google has removed a couple of options alongside that. AssembleDeBug noted that the floating bar no longer contains options for voice notes, nor is there a dedicated photo button.</p><p>It&apos;s speculated that Google has popped both options inside the additional options menu (plus icon) when in a newly created note. The pill-shaped bar notably affects Keep in Landscape mode, as the test shows users should experience more content and less toolbar obstruction</p>

<p>Google went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">down a similar road</a> with its messaging app Chat last November. The company rolled out a UI redesign for the app, revamping it with a floating, pill-shaped toolbar with several shortcuts. Users were able to quickly dive into their home panel, direct messages, spaces, and mentions.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is the second test Google has been spotted working on for Keep in recent times, with the first involving AI. In February, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">started a test</a> to bring Gemini-powered features to Keep in the form of a "Help me create a list" feature. Similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>," Keep&apos;s version is said to assist users in creating lists for shopping, things to do, and packing.</p><p>The app&apos;s code showed that users will eventually find a floating "help me create a list" button at the bottom of a new note. Users can then write a prompt detailing what they&apos;d like the AI bot to do. While it was suggested that users give "more specifics" to help the AI, personal information should be kept out of it.</p>

<ul><li>Information has leaked about which cores MediaTek could pack into its upcoming Dimensity 9400 flagship SoC.</li><li>Rumors suggest it could offer Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores, but its exact CPU layout is still unknown.</li><li>Previous rumors detailed its early benchmark scores, which saw MediaTek's chip beat Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 in one of the two tests.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information on MediaTek&apos;s upcoming response to Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 has leaked, showing us how the competition might shake down.</p><p>According to Digital Chat Station (DCS) on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O637drBmr">Weibo</a>, MediaTek&apos;s next flagship SoC may feature Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/dimensity-9400-could-give-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-a-hard-time-as-more-details-about-the-chipset-surface/">WCCFtech</a>). DCS didn&apos;t go into detail about the chip&apos;s CPU layout, though there is some speculation.</p><p>The publication suggests the Dimensity 9400 could feature five X5 cores, three X4 cores, and four A7xx cores. We&apos;re still left wondering what speeds the Dimensity 9400 could clock in at.</p><p>The Weibo post concluded with rumors about MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC. DCS states the chip could offer a "super-large" Cortex-X4 at 3.4GHz. The chip may also launch in May.</p><p>If the rumors are true, it seems as though MediaTek is ditching the idea of efficiency cores for its flagship Soc — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">like last year</a>. However, the chip could offer further leaps over its predecessor, considering the speculation behind the inclusion of X5 cores. The Dimensity 9300 delivered four Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>Previous rumors about the upcoming flagship chip suggest it will be built off a 3nm process instead of the last-gen&apos;s 4nm process. Moreover, early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">leaked benchmark results</a> suggest it could outperform Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. It was rumored in February that the Dimensity 9400 achieved a 2776 score on the single-core test and a score of 11,739 on the multicore test.</p><p>It&apos;s wise to take these results with caution until we know officially during the chip&apos;s official launch. Qualcomm&apos;s chip is expected to debut featuring its stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Oryon cores</a>, so that&apos;s another aspect to be aware of.</p><p>Meanwhile, MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-optimizes-dimensity-chips-for-gemini-nano">recently optimized</a> their Dimensity 9300 and 8300 chips for Gemini Nano&apos;s capabilities in conjunction with Google. While the former was designed with generative AI in mind, further tuning ensured Google&apos;s latest AI model could work seamlessly on devices with the previously mentioned chips.</p><p>Considering this, perhaps we can expect more AI influence in MediaTek&apos;s upcoming reveal. The company isn&apos;t expected to debut its Dimensity 9400 chip until later this year, potentially in October.</p>

With this change, Samsung has introduced a split progress bar to show that the update is going on seamlessly.</p><p>Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman chimed in and shared some insights on X (formerly Twitter), noting that those who own Samsung&apos;s newest mid-range model are noticing this feature.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung may have finally implemented seamless updates on their Android devices! When updating the new Galaxy A55 5G, users have noticed that the software update screen now shows a "downloading and installing" as well as "verification" steps.

<p>After checking out the software update screen, users noticed two stages of installation: the "downloading and installing" phase and the "verification" phase.</p><p>This means that you won&apos;t have to wait for ages as your phone installs system updates anymore. Your device will quietly install the update in the background, and all you&apos;ll need to do is restart your phone to apply it. It&apos;s a bit like what Google&apos;s been doing with its Pixels since the very first model.</p><p>Normally, when you download and install an update on a Samsung device, you need to restart your phone to finish it. And while that&apos;s happening, you&apos;re stuck not being able to use your device until it&apos;s all sorted.</p><p>However, it looks like some Galaxy A55 users were able to keep using their phones while the update was downloaded quietly in the background.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s adoption of seamless updates is not entirely a surprise. Back in 2022, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-working-on-seamless-updates-one-ui-6">Samsung executive spilled the beans</a> and confirmed that the company was cooking up plans to roll out seamless updates. It now looks like the company has finally made it happen.</p><p>What&apos;s really interesting is that Samsung decided to debut this feature on one of its mid-range phones instead of saving it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Galaxy models</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>While it looks like seamless updates are up and running on the Galaxy A55 now, Samsung hasn&apos;t rolled out this feature to all its devices just yet. However, there&apos;s a chance the South Korean tech giant might introduce it to other models through future updates.</p>
