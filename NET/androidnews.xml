                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It&apos;s typically pretty easy to find Mint Mobile deals that&apos;ll lower your phone bill, but now that T-Mobile&apos;s acquisition has been finalized, what does it mean for the MVNO&apos;s popular BOGO offer? Fortunately, at this time, no Mint Mobile offers have changed. If you switch to Mint Mobile from Verizon or AT&T and sign up for any three-month data plan, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/best-value-wireless/"><strong>the carrier will still give you a second identical plan for 100% free</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Bring your number over from AT&T or Verizon and sign up for any three-month data plan, and Mint Mobile will hook you up with a second identical plan for 100% free. This BOGO offer will apply to any of Mint's plans, including the Unlimited tier (currently just $45 for three months). <strong>The acquisition by T-Mobile shouldn't have any effect on this deal. </strong></p>
<p>All of Mint's data plans are powered by T-Mo's vast 5G network, plus you get unlimited talk and text, free calls to Mexico and Canada, a free mobile hotspot, and much more. You're also only paying for three months of wireless service. If you decide you don't want to stick with Mint after that time, simply cancel your account and you'll only be down $45. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/best-value-wireless/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ab32f7a5-8d99-48d7-9ba0-9d24b36b787b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Buy one plan, get a second plan FREE at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Buy one plan, get a second plan FREE at Mint Mobile">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>All data plans are eligible for the deal — including the Unlimited plan — and since all of Mint&apos;s plans are just $15 per month for the first three months (for a limited time), this means that you can cover TWO users with excellent coverage for three months and only pay $45 upfront. Seriously. </p><p>Will other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> be subject to change now that T-Mobile officially owns the MVNO? It&apos;s possible, but you probably have a while before the carrier implements any dramatic changes. After all, the carrier has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-completes-mint-mobile-acquisition">made it pretty clear</a> that it has no plans to change its $15/month plan any time soon, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>Ready to switch to Visible? Join the Verizon-owned carrier and use the code GOOGLE during checkout and you'll score a whopping $240 discount on the Pixel 8, no trade-in required. A bunch of other Pixel devices are also included in the deal, so take a look at the <a href="https://www.visible.com/shop/smartphones/google"><strong>official promo page</strong></a> to find the right phone for you. </p>
<p>Despite falling behind when compared to the latest offerings from Samsung and OnePlus, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> remains a great choice if you want a versatile flagship with loads of cutting-edge features. You get a stunning OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, plus the efficient Google Tensor G3 chipset and some of the best camera tech on any Pixel phone to date. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/shop/smartphones/google-pixel-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="92490e51-a507-45a7-a9cb-16475a5b4a3f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 8 128GB: $699" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 8 128GB: $699">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Even before launching these new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-buyers-guide">Visible deals</a>, the Verizon-owned carrier had spent the last few months adding some pretty awesome updates to its service. The Visible Plus plan has been expanded to include additional international perks and a faster mobile hotspot, plus new members can now pay for either plan annually to receive some additional savings.</p><p>The best part is that the prices on both of Visible&apos;s plans haven&apos;t changed a penny, so you still get to enjoy all of the same benefits that made the company one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">our favorite wireless carriers</a>. </p><p>The Visible Basic plan starts at $25 per month while Visible Plus will set you back $45 per month. Both plans include unlimited talk, text, and data from Verizon, plus you get a free spam filter, the aforementioned mobile hotspot, and unlimited talk and text in Mexico and Canada. Paying for the more-expensive Visible Plus plan will get you everything above along with unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries, 5G Ultra Wideband data, and more. </p>

<p>Yes, you might have a dilemma here. If you&apos;ve read our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-vs-mint-mobile">Mint Mobile vs. Visible guide</a>, you&apos;ll know that Mint and Visible are two of our favorite carriers if you want reliable, straightforward wireless service for cheap. Mint is (now officially) owned and powered by T-Mobile, while Visible is entirely under the banner of Verizon. </p><p>Just like Visible, Mint Mobile is currently running a great deal on the Google Pixel 8 that comes with six months of free wireless service when you buy a six-month plan. </p><p>Which offer is better? It&apos;s ultimately going to depend on your needs and whether your area has better coverage from T-Mobile or Verizon. It&apos;s a tough decision, but no matter who you choose, you&apos;ll be getting an outstanding smartphone and wireless service from one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> in the biz. </p>

<p>Google is rolling out a useful feature for its Phone app that lets users express their quirky creativity in a new way.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4025?single">Google News</a> on Telegram, the company is starting to roll out "Audio Emojis" in the Phone app. Users will be able to toggle the feature in the app&apos;s settings. From there, Google describes the feature as one that can help users "express emotions and moods with sounds like applause, laughter, sad, trombone, and more."</p><p>When enabled, users can call their friends and family and start experimenting with the new sounds. On the Phone app&apos;s call screen, there will be an option to expand the Audio Emoji&apos;s row of faces above the default toolbar.</p><p>Six emojis will be present, and tapping one will play its appropriate sound and a quick animation on the screen behind the UI.</p><p>Google is rolling out Audio Emojis for the Phone app today (May 2). However, it seems that the feature is arriving first in the app&apos;s beta version. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2024/04/30/google-phone-gets-audio-emoji/">DroidLife</a>, Audio Emojis have been spotted on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> running version 128.0.6 of the beta Phone app.</p><p>So, it seems users on a wider scale will have to wait a little while longer before it arrives on the stable version. It should become available through a Play Store update.</p>

<p>The Phone app&apos;s latest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-audiomoji-reactions-spotted">was spotted a couple of times</a> before, going from the "sound reactions" moniker to "Audiomoji" before today. The feature&apos;s most recent appearance in the app&apos;s code showed evidence of the six reactions Google is beginning to roll out for beta testers.</p><p>Meanwhile, it was spotted that Google could be working on a way to let phone users easily transfer their calls<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-voice-to-video-call-one-tap-action"> to Meet</a>. A few users spotted the option to initiate a video call, indicating Google&apos;s testing of the feature. When initiating, the phone call will continue while the video call "rings" in the background until the other user accepts. </p><p>If that user isn&apos;t on Meet, Google seems to create an invite for you to send them.</p>

<p>Snapchat highlighted a long-awaited feature that is still in the works while rolling out several new additions to its app today (May 2).</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-features-may-2024">Newsroom post</a>, Snapchat is preparing to bring an edit button to messages. The feature is known as "Editable Chats," which will let users correct a mistake in a message within five minutes after sending it. While exciting, the post states the edit button is "coming soon" and will arrive for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-plus-launch">Snapchat Plus</a> subscribers before everyone else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1063px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MpfEwBSyJ3N5aLtxgxheqU" name="snapchat-edit-messages-teaser.jpg" alt="Snapchat teases that an edit button will soon arrive for messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpfEwBSyJ3N5aLtxgxheqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1063" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Snapchat)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These next few features are rolling out on Snapchat, beginning with "Emoji Reactions." The company states that users can now react to anything on the platform with any emoji they desire. Previously, users could react through their Bitmoji, so this expanded array of options should be handy.</p><p>Speaking of Bitmoji, the post adds that the personal little avatars can now benefit from AI. All users need to do is give the AI a quick description of what they&apos;d like their Bitmoji to wear, and it will do the rest. Snapchat states users can give descriptors like "vibrant graffiti" or "skull flower" to the AI.</p><p>After, users can tap on what they like to edit before saving it on their Bitmoji.</p>

<p>Map reactions have made their way into the latest update as Snapchat looks to incite conversations between friends sharing their location. The Snap Map will now display a row of suggested emojis above a friend&apos;s location box at the bottom. Tapping will send it over, alongside a quick animation. The plus icon is available, just in case users are looking for the perfect emoji to send.</p><p>AI continues to slide into Snapchat, and this time, it&apos;s through a new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.snapchat.com/lens/a07c83f0bd2846fb93c636d33140273c?type=SNAPCODE&metadata=01&lang=en-US">90s AI Lens</a>." The feature works similarly to a filter, however, tapping the 90s AI lens <em>after </em>snapping a photo will apply the unique effect.</p><p>Lastly, AI reminders are rolling out. Snapchat states users can lean on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snap-my-ai-openai-chatgpt">My AI</a> whenever they need to remember something in a direct chat or a chat with a friend. Telling the AI to set a reminder for a certain day and time will prompt the bot to create a countdown.</p><p>After acknowledging it, My AI will display a quick banner highlighting the date, time, and who&apos;s involved.</p><p>As the features begin to roll out,  Snapchat indicated that the edit button would take a little longer; however, the company did not give a timeframe for seeing it.</p>

Homey adds that users can find Moods in the "Home" tab under "Favorite Moods" or within the "Devices" tab of the mobile app. Similarly, users can begin controlling their light via the web.</p><p>When creating a Mood, users can select the lights they&apos;d like to use in a room. The Homey app then allows users to customize the colors that&apos;ll be displayed when that Mood is used.</p><p>Additionally, Homey features a selection of pre-made lights within categories like "Modern" and "Chill."</p><p>Homey product owners can even kickstart a Mood through Flow. The post reiterates that your custom lights will activate when arriving home, pressing a button, or when a sensor picks you up. The company teases "more flexibility" when combining Moods with Flow.</p><p>For example, if "Movie Night" is a Mood theme, Homey states Flow will activate your lights, close the curtains, and turn the TV on.</p>

<p>Moods also fully supports voice assistants like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Homey suggests that users re-sync their devices with the AI helpers before giving them a command. For example, users can say, "Hey Google, sync my devices," before telling it to "start Movie Time."</p><p>Homey&apos;s Moods are available today (May 2) for users on its free and Premium tiers. Users should ensure that their Homey app has been updated to version 8.2 or later to utilize Moods. The post states that Homey Pro gets in on it, too, so long as owners are willing to produce a €10 fee to unlock Moods "later this year."</p>

<p>Another competitor in the &apos;ring&apos; seems to be against Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Ring. Zepp Health, the health technology company, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zepp-health-announces-us-launch-date-for-amazfit-helio-ring-302131194.html">announced</a> on Wednesday that the Amazfit Helio Ring is set to launch on May 15, either as part of a bundle with the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review"> Amazfit Cheetah Pro</a> or<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review"> Amazfit T-Rex Ultra</a> or as an independent purchase via the official Amazfit website in the United States. </p><p>Unveiled at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-launch-ces-2024">CES 2024,</a> the Amazfit Helio Ring is lightweight and measures 2.6mm thick. Its built-in sensors monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, and sleep. Amazfit says the ring will use this data to help analyze performance and provide a &apos;readiness&apos; score within the Zepp app.</p><p>"At Zepp Health, we&apos;re empowering athletes with elite-level performance and recovery analysis right at their fingertips," said Wayne Huang, CEO of Zepp Health.</p><p>The Zepp App, Huang said, will seamlessly integrate data from the athlete&apos;s smartwatch and their Amazfit Helio Ring, giving users complete access to all their insights in one place. </p><p>"It&apos;s not just about monitoring; it&apos;s about leveraging every bit of insight to push boundaries, unlock potential, and redefine athletic excellence," Huang added.</p><p>The Amazfit Helio Ring will be priced at $299.99.

However, Zepp Health says additional sizing and general availability to other markets will follow soon.</p><p>Amazfit is also set to offer this ring in bundles; when paired with their smartwatches, the ring will be priced at $149.99.

I had been knee-deep in Starcraft for the past year and wasn’t ready for how mind-blowing and genre-defining Homeworld would become to 3D space RTS titles. Imagine my elation, then, when Homeworld: Vast Reaches was announced for the Meta Quest.</p><p>Homeworld VR takes the same brilliant gameplay and strategies from the original and perfectly translates them into VR but carefully redesigns the UI to be simple yet powerful. Commands to multiple groups can be issued instantly, and a clever pause system channels Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by letting you take a breather to strategize and build before the enemy comes in for the kill.</p>

<p>The story takes place between Homeworld 1 and 2, helping fill in the gaps for fans of the story. The entire experience is fully voice narrated with an excellent and believable cast, too, just as you would expect from any mainline entry in the series. I’ve long imagined what Homeworld would feel like in VR, and Homeworld: Vast Reaches finally brought my imagination to life in a way I didn’t expect would ever happen.</p><p>Better yet, it&apos;s available right now on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7777435315609988/">Meta Horizon store</a> with a $10 launch discount and is even making its way to SteamVR later this year.</p>
<p>But it&apos;s not the only big franchise that&apos;s made the jump to VR recently, much less this year. Series like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin&apos;s Creed</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/among-us-vr-review">Among Us</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/resident-evil-4-vr-review">Resident Evil 4 VR</a> made waves in 2023 and 2022, while other PC gaming favorites like Medieval Dynasty and Tropico just made their first debut in VR on the Meta Quest platform.</p><p>And coming up, we&apos;ve got the likes of Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s: Help Wanted 2, Alien: Rogue Incursion, Metro Awakening, and Zombie Army VR, and even a Meta Quest 3-exclusive entry <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3">into the Batman: Arkham series</a>.</p><p>So many great series are making the jump to VR and aren&apos;t afraid to change things up a bit to fit the paradigm better. It&apos;s encouraging for folks who might be overwhelmed with the number of indies and bespoke titles on the platform, and the general quality of releases like Homeworld: Vast Reaches only further helps justify the need for a VR console designed to help people play VR games in a far less friction-filled way than ever before.</p>

<p>Homeworld was one of the first 3D games I can recall nailing the navigational aspect of three-dimensional space. But what the flat-screen series excelled at, the VR version of Homeworld perfected. There’s an incredibly natural feeling about looking around and grabbing to move in virtual space.</p><p>In many ways, the control scheme apes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-best-new-quest-2-game-of-2023-wont-even-cost-you-a-dime">Gods of Gravity</a>, my other favorite VR space RTS game. Grabbing in the void of space with the grip button on one controller will let you pull yourself along through space exactly as you would expect it to. Likewise, grabbing with both controllers at the same time and using a “pinch” or “separate” motion will zoom in and out, changing the scale of your ships.</p><p>This makes it simple to quickly zoom out, issue several quick commands, and then zoom way in to get a closer look at the action. You can also use the right stick to quickly teleport between groups of ships, making it easy to zoom around the battlefield with little effort.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>What the flat-screen Homeworld games excelled at, the VR version of Homeworld perfected.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Homeworld VR is a game that thrives for players who can micromanage effectively, and it’s a skill you’ll need to develop if you want to play on any difficulty other than easy. In fact, strategy is one thing this game does better than probably any other VR strategy game I’ve played to date. It’s really difficult, and I had to play many missions over and over again until I figured out a strategy that worked for the scenario.</p><p>This isn’t a forgiving game, and you won’t be using quick checkpoints to reverse mistakes. Resources are limited in each area, and you’ll feel the desperation of the crew as it hyperspace jumps from sector to sector just trying to survive another day.</p><p>In many ways, it reminds me a lot of Battlestar Galactica, as each jump tends to feel more and more desperate as the enemy constantly hunts you down and drains your fleet of its resources.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Homeworld: Vast Reaches is optimized for Quest 3 from day one.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unlike a lot of other VR games launched this year, Homeworld: Vast Reaches is optimized for Quest 3 from day one. Graphics are sharp and clean, textures look excellent, and the high-res skyboxes make space feel as infinite as it should.</p><p>Furthermore, the mixed reality mode lets you swap out that skybox for the room you’re in instead. It was a little distracting for my tastes, but this is a game that feels best when you’re walking around the room, traversing space with your own two feet as if you were a giant god.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jXbs6uvZ5fYz5ttcqXvpek" name="homeworld-vast-reaches-mixed-reality-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Looking at an asteroid field in a living room while playing Homeworld Vast Reaches on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXbs6uvZ5fYz5ttcqXvpek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The mixed reality mode is impressive, letting you walk around in a giant galactic playspace.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Enabling the mixed reality mode and sizing the map to your play space gives it the feel of a giant zero-gravity playground. It’s incredibly cool and unique among other space games I’ve played on the system.</p><p>As with the original two Homeworld games, there are no multiplayer options in Homeworld VR. For that, you’ll probably want to check out Gods of Gravity, as it’s built for multiplayer space battles. Plus, that game is free to play, so there’s no cost for entry.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The entire experience is fully voice narrated with an excellent and believable cast just as you would expect from any mainline entry in the series.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I’m fine with the developers focusing on single-player content for this release. The voice acting, story quality, and well-balanced scenarios tell me that this title has been meticulously crafted to fit perfectly in between the existing mainline games. It’s a huge win for VR gamers as it delivers yet another full-fledged gaming experience with the magic that comes from experiencing a game in VR.</p><p>There’s nothing quite like being inside a game like Homeworld VR, especially when it’s as intuitively designed as this game is.</p>
<h2 id="too-much-compromise-2">Too much compromise?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NLyzmcA9h4DoLuK7xEwfWY" name="homeworld-vast-reaches-official-screenshot-03.jpg" alt="A close-up of ships in battle in an official screenshot of Homeworld Vast Reaches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NLyzmcA9h4DoLuK7xEwfWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Farbridge)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest downside to Homeworld: Vast Reaches at launch is the length of the game. The story mode spans 11 missions, each of which will likely only take around 20 minutes to complete. That means you&apos;ll probably finish the game in normal mode in under three hours. The developer says the game is more than 5 hours long, but this seems like it must include playing through multiple difficulty settings.</p><p>While this seems like a dreadfully short amount of time for any game — especially one that normally retails for $30 — there&apos;s a silver lining to be found. Homeworld VR launches on the SteamVR version that&apos;s set to launch a little later this year, which will include "improvements and expansions made for Steam that will come to Quest as well."</p><p>In other words, the current Quest version can be thought of a bit like an early access model. Thankfully, there&apos;s a promise of more content to come shortly, but it&apos;s still a tough buy-in in its current short state unless you&apos;re a fan of the series or RTS games, in general.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Quest release of Homeworld VR is a bit like an early access version, promising more content to come later this year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That makes me wonder what we should expect from two major AAA games coming to the Quest 3 later this year. Games like Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus and Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2 delivered AAA-level gameplay depth, but many players seem to shy away from some of the longer single-player games in favor of shorter experiences based on sales for both titles.</p><p>Both Alien: Rogue Incursion and Batman: Arkham Shadow have huge expectations to live up to, but there&apos;s no telling which avenue each developer is considering right now.</p><p>Will they go the route of Assassin&apos;s Creed and Asgard&apos;s Wrath and offer dozens (or hundreds) of hours of gameplay, or stick with the short-but-sweet type of game that Homeworld VR currently is? It&apos;ll certainly be interesting to find out, but regardless of the length, I&apos;m glad we&apos;re getting so many amazing AAA-tier experiences in VR.</p>

Taking hide and seek to the next level, Prop Hunt tasks players with disguising themselves as various items (or props) in an environment—stuff you&apos;d find in a multiplayer game map. It&apos;s so popular that it&apos;s gone on to spawn tons of imitators, including from the likes of Fortnite. But Mannequin isn&apos;t just a cheap imitator. Bringing this premise into VR infuses this winning setup with engaging originality.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/adAL6sKB8Z4?start=1" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>We at Android Central have been excited about Mannequin since it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-news-of-the-week-september-15-2023">first announced last year</a> and ahead of its launch in the App Lab, I had the opportunity to play Mannequin with some of its developers before launch. Throughout my hour-or-so demo of the game, I played as both a human agent and one of the invading alien Mannequins and explored a pair of the maps that will be available in the game at launch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The world of Mannequin has been invaded by eponymous aliens with the ability to freeze humans and disguise themselves as frozen humans at any point.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The world of Mannequin has been invaded by eponymous aliens with the ability to freeze humans and disguise themselves as frozen humans at any point. Their goal is to freeze both of the human agents without getting shot or caught or to take down all three power stations on the map. Each map is packed with identical-looking frozen humans who&apos;ve been spawned in random places. Trying to blend in, you can freeze in place as a Mannequin at any point and in any pose as you lurk in disguise, waiting for an unassuming agent to pass by.</p><p>Both your pose and positioning when you freeze matter here. Not only will an unnatural pose give you away, but it&apos;s also important that you take the frozen humans&apos; positions into account when you get ready to strike. While you&apos;re frozen, you can still look around freely, too, which makes it easier to take a tough but convincing pose without turning your back to the enemy. You can also perform a dash while frozen or while moving around. The dash is on a short cooldown time, so you&apos;ll need to strike carefully or hope that your prey has bad aim.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c5bYYA7FqrUXwiC2BS3Hr4" name="MQ_Screenshot_ShootingUp.png" alt="A screenshot from Mannequin VR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5bYYA7FqrUXwiC2BS3Hr4.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fast Travel Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tasked with hunting down the Mannequins, Agents are equipped with a sensor that reveals any aliens within a certain area and a gun that senses nearby aliens and vibrates when pointed in their general direction but doesn&apos;t explicitly reveal them.</p><p>The gun only starts loaded with a few rounds and shooting a civilian target will cause it to jam, making sure that you&apos;re not just firing around willy-nilly. But if you&apos;re a little trigger-happy, you can refill your weapon at the same stations that the Mannequins are trying to shut down, creating a reason to defend these chokepoints with incentives beyond just eliminating the alien threat.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Agents must take down the aliens but have to use special tools to identify them — or be clever enough to spot the ruse among the frozen humans.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Players in either role have a chance to revive a downed teammate, but doing so might put them at risk of being found out or eliminated by another player. The way these teams are balanced lends an engrossingly tense pace to each match, with just a few interactions determining each round.</p><p>Neither side felt over or underpowered, either, and I had a great time playing as both though I think I preferred to play as a Mannequin because of how fun it was trying to find believable poses.</p><p>I had a great time checking out Mannequin. On top of being an already creative take on the genre, it&apos;s a premise that truly works best in VR: posing with full control of your limbs elevates both the challenge and interactivity by making it a bit harder to strike a convincing pose.</p><p>In kneading these mechanics into an already winning recipe, Mannequin shows a lot of promise. And based on a few hints from the developers during my session, I&apos;m all-but positive that Fast Travel Games have big plans for Mannequin&apos;s future. If they play their cards right, I&apos;m certain Mannequin could wind up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best games on Quest</a>. But for now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7028027297235918/">download Mannequin</a> through the Quest&apos;s App Lab starting today. </p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out passkeys to its Advanced Protection Program.</li><li>The news was unveiled during the World Password Day celebration, marking a year since passkeys were introduced across Google's services.</li><li>Google is also collaborating with various industry players to extend cross-account protection, sharing security notifications across platforms to enhance overall user security.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that it&apos;s bringing passkeys to its Advanced Protection Program, which aims to keep high-risk users safe, just in time for the upcoming US elections and amid growing cyber threats.</p><p>The announcement was made during the World Password Day commemoration, a year after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-next-major-phase-of-passkey">rolled out passkeys as a password alternative across its services</a>. It&apos;s part of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-m108-passkey-support">broader effort to replace passwords with passkeys</a>, which require only biometric data to unlock your device.</p><p>Google&apos;s Advanced Protection Program aims to shield certain users who face the biggest risks of getting targeted by cyber attacks, including campaign workers, candidates, journalists, and human rights activists, among others.</p><p>In the past, signing up for the program meant you had to hook up hardware security keys as a second factor to prove it&apos;s really you logging into your account. Today&apos;s announcement means that soon, you&apos;ll have the choice to sign up using any passkey alongside your hardware security keys.</p><p>You&apos;ll even get to decide whether to use just your passkeys or pair them with a password.</p><p>Google has also shared a few stats alongside this expansion. As per the company, passkeys have been used over 1 billion times across over 400 million Google accounts. In just the last year, big names like Amazon, 1Password, Dashlane, Docusign, Kayak, Mercari, and Shopify have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/upgrade-to-passkeys-on-pixel-with-google-password-manager">jumped on the passkey train</a>.</p><p>On top of all that, Google is teaming up with even more players in the industry to boost cross-account protection, ensuring billions of users stay safe wherever they roam online.</p><p>With this initiative, Google "shares security notifications" about any sketchy activities on your Google account with other apps and services you use, even if they&apos;re not from Google. This way, those apps and services can beef up security using Google&apos;s intel to keep all your accounts under lock and key.</p><p>According to the search giant, this is super important because cybercriminals usually start with one door to try to access the rest of your precious data.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> is one of my favorite phones of the year; it has considerable camera upgrades from last year, a gorgeous design that stands out, powerful hardware, and interesting software features. So when Honor announced it was making a Porsche Design variant of the device, I was obviously interested.</p><p>I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-review">Porsche Design Magic V2 RSR foldable</a> when it debuted, and it had plenty of unique design characteristics that made it distinctive — even more so than the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, which isn&apos;t a bad phone to look at by any measure. With the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR, Honor is turning things up a notch, delivering what is possibly one of the best phones of 2024.</p><p>The Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has custom styling and is available in interesting color choices, and it comes with 1TB of storage and 24GB of RAM, which is just overkill. I used the device as my daily driver for over two weeks, and here&apos;s why I think it is the best version of the Magic 6 Pro.</p>

<p>Honor unveiled the Magic 6 RSR Porsche Design on March 18 in China, and the phone made its debut in the U.K. on May 2. The phone is also headed to the Middle East, Malaysia, and Germany in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Magic 6 RSR is available in a single variant that has 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and it costs £1,599 ($2,004) in the U.K. That&apos;s considerably more than its retail price of 9,999 RMB ($1,380) in China, and a sizeable premium over the standard version of the Magic 6 Pro, which is available for £1,099 ($1,378) in the U.K. Honor is running a deal right now that discounts the device by an additional £250 ($313), bringing the cost down to £849 ($1,064). That said, the standard model has 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="y9CzwT4dQVVUxYnbR6YaZF" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-magic-6-pro-1.jpg" alt="Back view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR next to Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9CzwT4dQVVUxYnbR6YaZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is the biggest point of differentiation with the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR, and there is a lot to go over. The standard Magic 6 Pro has a pillow camera island (Honor&apos;s words, not mine) that looks great in its own right, and with the Magic 6 RSR, the brand went with a new design that stands out much better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QgQgtnCEhkMTsbJFRH6tJE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-camera-island-hand.jpg" alt="Camera island view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgQgtnCEhkMTsbJFRH6tJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera module uses Porsche&apos;s "iconic hexagonal structure" that evokes the "essence of precision and high-performance characteristics of sports cars." The camera island is made out of titanium, and it contrasts well with the glass back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pFERLMXh9NMC5sMtFAuiGF" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-magic-6-pro-.jpg" alt="Back view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with angled view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFERLMXh9NMC5sMtFAuiGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is available in two color variants — Agate Grey and Frozen Berry — and while I wanted to take a look at the grey model, the pink Frozen Berry variant stands out much better. Honor says the color "exudes a sense of boldness and fearlessness, adding an element of exclusivity to the device." I don&apos;t know about the fearlessness, but the color is definitely bold, and it grabs quite a lot of attention. And on that subject, the same color extends to the mid-frame as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yNmetwN3KPkJZXCDRnJHzE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-ir.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR IR blaster against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNmetwN3KPkJZXCDRnJHzE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I don&apos;t like about the design is that the glass back has a glossy coat, and it is a smudge magnet. If anything, the vegan leather of the standard Magic 6 Pro feels much better to hold and use. The glossy texture continues on the sides too, and Honor should have used a matte coating on both variants.</p>

<p>Although I don&apos;t like using cases with my phones, the glossy back of the Magic 6 RSR necessitates one, and Honor bundles a minimal leather case in the package that does a terrific job. The case makes it significantly easier to hold the device, and it has a much better feel — Honor should have used this at the back as standard. And yes, the case has Porsche Design branding highlighted prominently, and there&apos;s even needless stitching along the middle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AzMbono9g3oGVLbnEDZg3D" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-back-angle.jpg" alt="Angled view showcasing back of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMbono9g3oGVLbnEDZg3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, the other unique design trait is the flyline at the back that creates a wedge, and it immediately differentiates the device. There&apos;s Porsche Design branding for good measure, and while I wasn&apos;t initially sold on the color, I&apos;ve grown fond of it in the two weeks I used the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="r46Qkm5rkUkNbQ2phsU5eG" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-side-view.jpg" alt="Angled view of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r46Qkm5rkUkNbQ2phsU5eG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is still heavy at 237g, but it has good weight distribution, and the curvy profile means it is easy to hold. It retains IP68 ingress protection — a must-have feature on a device that costs over $2,000 — and while the in-screen module sits a little lower on the screen, it isn&apos;t particularly awkward to access.</p><p>On the whole, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has all the accouterments you&apos;d want in a custom variant, and it is different enough to the standard Magic 6 Pro that it has its own visual identity.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-hardware-and-screen"><span>Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR: Hardware and screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HwdUP8VLAegGj8LzPySfaE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-home-6.jpg" alt="Home page of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HwdUP8VLAegGj8LzPySfaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not going to talk too much about the hardware as the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR is nearly identical to the standard Magic 6 Pro in this regard. It has the same 6.8-inch 120Hz OLED panel that goes up to 5,000 nits in HDR content, and there are absolutely no issues in daily use. </p><p>The panel gets bright, has outstanding color vibrancy and contrast levels, and there&apos;s a decent amount of customizability. What&apos;s different is that Honor is using a dual-layer OLED that guarantees panel longevity, and while the screen is just as bright as the regular variant, it will stay that way a lot longer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yxdHMq9xSLVy4FW6KhDdPG" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-selfie-cameras.jpg" alt="Selfie cameras of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yxdHMq9xSLVy4FW6KhDdPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 2800 x 1200 resolution isn&apos;t quite as high as the QHD+ panels that you get on most other phones in this segment, but it holds up well for all daily usage scenarios. Honor eschewed Corning and went with its own NanoCrystal Shield coating, and it does a good job protection the phone — it took a tumble onto a tiled surface a week after I started using it, and came away unscathed. Incidentally, I decided to use a case after that incident (that back really is very glossy).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cNujs6X4DVvQqvh3BgbjcC" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-always-on.jpg" alt="Always-on mode of the Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with phone against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNujs6X4DVvQqvh3BgbjcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor&apos;s always-on mode allows you to have the entire screen awake, including the background — similar to how it works in iOS — or you can switch to just having a clock or a custom style. While the device isn&apos;t quite as bright as its rivals in outdoor use, it shines at media playback, and HDR content in particular is a delight.</p>

<p>As for the hardware, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR is powered by the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> as the standard model, and it comes with 24GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Look, 24GB of RAM is unnecessary on a phone as you can&apos;t really use that much memory, but I like that the phone has 1TB of storage. I tend to take a lot of videos these days, and storage is a real problem; this is one of the reasons why I don&apos;t like using the Pixel 8 Pro and its pitiful 128GB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g5NLCwwVVbH6BzBcovNUTE" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-home.jpg" alt="Home page of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background and angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g5NLCwwVVbH6BzBcovNUTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no issues with the Magic 6 RSR in daily use, and the phone handles intensive gaming without breaking a sweat. I didn&apos;t see any slowdowns on my unit, and even with extended gaming, there was no overheating. Similarly, I didn&apos;t run into any issues with connectivity — the phone had a stable signal throughout.</p>
<p>The only issue with the hardware is the haptic engine — it just doesn&apos;t do anything. This has been an issue on Honor phones for a while now, and even if you enable system haptics, you don&apos;t notice any feedback while using gestures. I was able to manually trigger it while using Gboard, but that&apos;s about it. The vibration motor isn&apos;t active while using the back gesture, navigating the UI, or in any other scenario.</p>

<p>The Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR has the same 5600mAh battery as the regular model, and it uses the same silicon-carbon tech to increase longevity of the battery. You get 80W charging and 66W wireless charging, and there&apos;s 5W reverse charging as well. Honor bundles the requisite charger in the box.</p><p>While I didn&apos;t see any issues with the battery on the regular Magic 6 Pro, that isn&apos;t the case on the Magic 6 RSR. The phone has unusually high battery drain in idle, and it only manages to last a day. It got to as low as 7% with heavy use by the end of the day, and as I don&apos;t charge my phones overnight, I decided to plug it in the next day. However, idle draw is so high that the phone switched off by the time I got up the following day; this hasn&apos;t been an issue on any phone in recent memory.</p><p>Most other phones with 5000mAh battery last considerably longer with the same usage patterns, and while most devices I used in 2024 go up to a day and a half, the Magic 6 RSR is woefully short on all measurable metrics in this area.

<p>We have a dedicated camera review of the Magic 6 Pro, so I&apos;m not going to talk about the cameras too much here. The Magic 6 RSR retains the same camera configuration as the standard model, and that means you get a 50MP main camera with an interesting variable f/1.4-2.0 lens and a 1/1.3-inch sensor. It&apos;s not quite as big as a 1-inch sensors in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, but it takes standout images and videos.</p><p>The main camera is joined by a 50MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens, and a 180MP f/2.6 telephoto lens that shoots at up to 2.5x optical zoom. The camera interface is similar to what you get with most brands, with plenty of toggles, modes, and scenes available. What I like about the Magic 6 RSR is that it is able take images of fast-moving objects incredibly well; I put that to good use to take photos of our ten-month-old baby.</p><p>There&apos;s AI-assisted scene recognition as well, and you get three custom styles — Natural, Vibrant, and Authentic. The Authentic mode has a vignette to it, so I went with the Vibrant mode. And like with most other phones, you get a decent Pro mode.</p>

<p>This goes without saying, but the Magic 6 RSR takes outstanding photos in daylight scenarios. Shots have plenty of detail and good color rendition, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the quality of the resultant shots. The phone does a magnificent job in low-light situations as well, and while the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Find X7 Ultra have a slender edge in this regard, the Magic 6 RSR gets pretty close.</p><p>Like its Chinese rivals, the Magic 6 RSR does a magnificent job with portrait shots. There&apos;s the option to choose from various focal lengths, and you can adjust the bokeh. The one thing to note is that beauty effects are enabled out of the box in this mode, and it is aggressive — you&apos;ll need to disable the mode to get accurate shots.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the phone does a great job with shots going up to 2.5x, and while there is some fringing with the wide-angle lens, it delivers usable shots in all situations. </p><p>While I don&apos;t take many selfies, the few that I managed to take with the front camera had poor color balance and just didn&apos;t measure up to the rear cameras. As a whole, the Magic 6 RSR has one of the best camera packages of any phone today.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CzWgVMo2akEhSReuB85XrF" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-notification-pane.jpg" alt="Control Center of Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR with toggles highlighted against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CzWgVMo2akEhSReuB85XrF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The global version of the Magic 6 RSR comes with MagicOS 8.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and it includes all the AI features that Honor introduced, including Magic Portal. But as I got the Chinese version of the device, I wasn&apos;t able to test the feature; ironically, I got two variants of the Magic 6 Pro thus far, but neither has the global build.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="byin7j4ZRKm3nhtUXGfg8G" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-notification.jpg" alt="Gmail notification on Porsche Design Honor Magic 6 RSR against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byin7j4ZRKm3nhtUXGfg8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As such, there isn&apos;t much to talk about in this section. MagicOS 8.0 is a definite upgrade, and it brings much-needed tweaks to Honor&apos;s phones. That said, issues from previous version of the interface are still intact; long pressing on an app doesn&apos;t pull up the app info, so you&apos;ll have to go into the settings, go to the Apps list, and manually locate the app if you want to change its notification settings.</p>
<p>The overview pane is also in need of an overhaul, and I don&apos;t like the split notification pane with the toggles to one side and notifications on the other. Other than that, the interface itself is fluid, and you get a good amount of customizability. Honor guarantees four platform updates as standard, but the brand isn&apos;t as quick to roll out those updates.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> continues to be my recommendation if you need a flagship that takes the best photos and videos. The 14 Ultra has a gorgeous design in its own right, and it is the only phone I used this year that outshines the Magic 6 Pro in the imaging section. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-Ultra-White-Smartphone-Snapdragon/dp/B0CRFR5BQD">in at £1,299</a> ($1,628), it isn&apos;t affordable by any measure, but it costs less than the Magic 6 RSR, and I like its software better. That said, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra only goes up to 512GB, and there isn&apos;t a 1TB model available.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s the regular Magic 6 Pro to consider. The phone has the same internals as the Magic 6 RSR, and it costs a lot less. You still get terrific cameras, a great design with a leather back, vibrant screen, and incredible hardware. The Magic 6 Pro has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and it is available for as low as £849 ($1,064) as of writing.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You like the look of the Magic 6 Pro and want a custom variant</li><li>You need terrific cameras</li><li>You need a bright AMOLED panel with plenty of customizability</li><li>You need all the extras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best value</li><li>You need multi-day battery life</li></ul>
<p>If you&apos;re considering the Magic 6 Pro and want something that stands out a bit more, the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR may just be the phone for you — provided you&apos;re ready to shell out the premium. The Porsche Design label continues to carry a premium, and while the Magic 6 RSR has double the memory and storage, it costs £500 ($626) more. But if that&apos;s not a consideration, you&apos;ll love what the phone has to offer.</p><p>The design is distinctive, and the hexagonal camera island combined with the color choices allows the Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR to turn heads. I still don&apos;t like the decision to use a glossy coat at the back on the Frozen Berry model, but the bundled leather case solves that issue without obscuring the design too much.</p><p>The rest of the device isn&apos;t too different to the standard Magic 6 Pro; you still get the same terrific cameras, the screen is one of the best around, and it has one of the best hardware packages available today. The battery life isn&apos;t as good as other flagships I used, and the vibration motor doesn&apos;t do much. But outside of that, there aren&apos;t any noticeable issues.</p><p>Ultimately, choosing between the Magic 6 Pro and Magic 6 RSR comes down to pricing; if you don&apos;t mind paying a premium, the Magic 6 RSR is the way to go. It has unique styling and 1TB of storage, and I think this is Honor&apos;s best phone yet.</p>
