<p>These days, the best Android phones under $300 don&apos;t require you to compromise a good experience. As mobile technology gets better and more affordable, you can enjoy features like full 5G connectivity, good software support, and fast charging, all without having to pay a fortune. Know what&apos;s even better? These sub-$300 phones often have some goodies like 3.5mm audio ports and expansion slots, which are no longer found on flagship devices.</p><p>At Android Central, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central">we test dozens of phones</a> per year, including ones that are less expensive or flashy, so our recommendations come with first-hand testing and reviews.</p><p>My top pick is the CMF Phone 1 by Nothing, a $200 phone that feels nothing like a budget pick. Not only does it have a unique modular design, but it&apos;s got a top-class OLED display, cameras you&apos;d normally find on $400+ phones, great software features, and an impressive software update commitment. But Nothing had to compromise somewhere to meet that $200 price point, which means NFC isn&apos;t included.</p><p>That&apos;s why there are so many other picks on this list, because while the CMF Phone 1 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">the only good $200 phone I&apos;ve ever used</a>, some other phones here might fill a particular niche better for you. Ready to spend less and still love the phone you get? Here are the best Android phones you can get for less than $300.</p>

<p>There <em>a lot</em> to love about the Poco X6 Pro, but its design will be the first standout feature you see—especially if you choose the yellow vegan leather version. Plus, fast 67W charging, a great main camera, and lots of features round it out.</p>

<p>The CMF Phone 1 is the most exciting budget phone I&apos;ve ever used. It&apos;s also the only <strong>truly good</strong> $200 phone I&apos;ve ever used and regularly feels more like a $400 phone. The first thing you&apos;ll notice about it, though, is the unique modular design. The back is held on with five removable screws and can be swapped out with several different colors and styles from the company.</p><p>Nothing also released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/12318-cmf-phone-1-a-platform-for-builders">official 3D printing guides</a>, meaning you can make your own accessories and backs or buy one from the 3D printing community! A plethora of unique accessories are hot-swappable via the single large thumbscrew on the bottom right, making it easy to pop on a kickstand, lanyard, or anything else you can dream up.</p><p>Aside from the design, the rest of the phone is simply brilliant. The bright OLED panel up front is not only wonderful to look at in any light but it&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e43pS8h7kzM">incredibly eye-friendly</a>. It&apos;s got the most powerful processor in its price class by far, giving you plenty of power for everyday tasks and surprisingly excellent gaming performance, as well.</p><p>The only reason this phone doesn&apos;t get the award for best camera under $300 is because the Pixel 6a exists, but it&apos;s barely a step down from that phone. Plus, the CMF Phone 1 takes much better portrait photos than the Pixel thanks to the dedicated portrait camera on the back and a better background blurring algorithm than Google&apos;s.</p><p>Finally, Nothing OS is a superb OS that I prefer over most flavors of Android. It not only has a unique dot matrix-like style but also features plenty of fun home screen widgets, great features, and three years of promised updates.

<p>In typical A-series fashion, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G manages to deliver excellent value for money. The smartphone features a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. Sure, the waterdrop-style notch has become a little long in the tooth at this point, but the screen gets pretty bright and works well for everyday usage.</p><p>Powered by the company&apos;s homegrown Exynos 1280 SoC, the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. While these are not top-of-the-line specifications, they&apos;re more than enough for handling tasks like web browsing and some casual gaming. You even get an expansion slot that can take up microSD cards of up to 1TB in size, allowing you to carry pretty much your entire media library in your pocket.</p><p>The smartphone runs Android 14 (with Samsung&apos;s newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6" target="_blank">One UI 6</a> overlay) and will get up to four years of OS updates, as well as five years of security updates. That means you get Android <strong>updates until Android 18</strong>! This excellent update policy alone makes the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G one of the best Android phones in its price range.</p><p>Speaking of cameras, there&apos;s a triple-lens setup at the back with a 50MP primary unit, an 8MP ultra-wide module, and a 2MP macro sensor. The smartphone can shoot some decent images in well-lit conditions, but low-light photos are largely unimpressive. As you&apos;d expect, the macro lens is mostly useless and only exists to pad the spec sheet. Up front, there&apos;s a 13MP unit for all your selfies and video calls. The whole package is backed by a 5,000mAh battery that comes with 25W wired charging support.</p>

<p>If the picture above doesn&apos;t already clue you in, the Poco X6 Pro has looks to kill and the build quality to match. The yellow color looks particularly striking and elegant with its vegan leather back, and the AMOLED display on the front is among the very best you&apos;ll find on mid-range phones, much less in the sub-$300 price class.</p><p>Poco&apos;s choice of a fast processor, plenty of RAM, and fast UFS 4.0 storage mean this phone feels faster than most in its class, giving you plenty of power for multitasking and gaming, alike. The downside is that the processor is a little <em>too</em> powerful to run without a more expensive internal cooling solution, so the phone gets pretty hot during longer gaming sessions.</p><p>Thankfully, that powerful processor doesn&apos;t negatively affect battery life. Quite the opposite, actually! Our reviewer, Harish, said that the Poco X6 featured "standout battery life" with ultra-fast 67W wired charging support.</p><p>The Poco X6 comes with Xiaomi&apos;s HyperOS, built on Android 14, which sports plenty of convenient features, great UI design, and three years of promised updates. That means you&apos;ll see <strong>Android 16</strong> plus one additional year of security updates before you should consider upgrading again.</p><p>Lastly, the main camera is quite good but the remainder of the cameras aren&apos;t worth using at all—particularly that useless 2MP macro camera. We&apos;re still not sure why some companies feel like a 2MP camera is worth putting on any phone in 2024 but we&apos;d recommend just not using it.</p>

<p>For generations now, Google Pixel phones have been lauded for their excellent cameras that take the most consistently-good pictures around. That&apos;s largely in part to Google&apos;s incredible software, which utilizes an intelligent HDR+ algorithm that constantly takes photos, then combines several into one amazing picture automatically.</p><p>If you compare the spec sheet for this phone versus other cameras—even ones on this list—you&apos;ll probably wonder how a 12 megapixel camera could possibly outclass a 50MP or higher sensor. The answer is that Google doesn&apos;t need more megapixels to make a great picture, and that&apos;s all because of what I said in the paragraph above.</p><p>I&apos;ve regularly called Pixel phones the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-best-smartphone-camera-parents-heres-why">best phones for parents and pet owners</a> because of their ability to capture crisp images of objects in motion—in this case, that means the kids and pets that refuse to hold still for a photo.</p><p>But while the camera is best-in-class, you&apos;ll also be pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Tensor G1 processor inside the Pixel 6a. It&apos;s twice as fast as the processor in the Galaxy A25 above and can play games and multitask better because of it. Tensor is known for getting a bit on the warm side, though, so don&apos;t plan to play cutting-edge games for too long at a time.</p><p>The real downside to picking up a Pixel 6a at this point is that Android 15 is the last major OS update the phone will receive, as official OS updates end in July 2025. You&apos;ll still get two more years of security updates, at least, but know that the new features you get next Summer are the last new features you&apos;ll get.</p>

<p>When it comes to displays, few look as good as the one on the Redmi Note 13 Pro. This gorgeous 6.67-inch AMOLED panel features those deep blacks and vibrant colors AMOLEDs are known for, and it punches that second part up a notch with 12-bit Dolby Vision support.</p><p>If you love watching movies on your phone, this is the one to get as that display will deliver the most accurate colors, widest dynamic range, and plenty of brightness to see clearly even in bright sunlight. Better yet, Xiaomi outfitted the display with eye-friendly capabilities including TÜV Rheinland certifications for low blue light, circadian friendly, and even flicker-free thanks to DC-like dimming at high brightness and 1920Hz PWM dimming at low brightness.</p><p>On top of that display is super durable Gorilla Glass Victus, a type of glass you normally only find on phones hundreds of dollars more expensive. And last but certainly not least is Xiaomi&apos;s Wet Touch feature which makes it easy to use the touch screen even when your hands are wet. Try that with your current phone and you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s impossible to accurately type or swipe when water is on the glass.</p><p>While our reviewer Harish wasn&apos;t impressed with the phone when it launched in September 2023, Xiaomi has since updated the phone with Android 14, fixed tons of bugs, and the new lower price all come together to make this a significantly better value than it used to be.</p><p>While Xiaomi was very slow to update this phone to Android 14—seven months after the phone and Android 14 officially launched—the Redmi Note 13 Pro still gets two more years of OS and security updates, though, so Xiaomi has plenty of time to make up for the slow first platform update.</p>

<p>Motorola truly reinvented itself over the past year as it launched not only our favorite foldable phone ever, but also a line of budget-friendly phones that look and feel amazing. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is the perfect example of this, melding a stylus design glad in vegan leather, all while housing a lovely stylus inside the phone&apos;s svelte frame.</p><p>The Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 processor inside isn&apos;t the fastest chip on this list, but it&apos;s still faster than the one found in the Samsung Galaxy A25 near the top of this list. Of course, the main draw of this phone isn&apos;t this performance though, it&apos;s the stylus house inside the body.</p><p>Motorola has a suite of software custom designed to work with the stylus, and although this isn&apos;t an active stylus like you&apos;ll find on more expensive Samsung phones that have stylus support, it&apos;s still nice to have one to jot down quick notes or annotate images and screenshots. Especially since it&apos;s always inside the phone waiting to be quickly used!</p><p>Motorola also upgraded the cameras this year, outfitting it with some surprisingly good image capture including an ultrawide-angle lens. Our reviewer, Derrek, was really impressed with the image quality and specifically lauded the phone for that feature.</p><p>While Motorola ships this one with Android 14 and its excellent Hello UX—complete with all our favorite Motorola gestures like double-chop to activate the flashlight—the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 will only get updated to Android 15, plus three years of security updates to ensure you feel safe online. If you don&apos;t care about tons of updates and want to prioritize a stylus, this is a great choice for under $300.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>While there&apos;s no doubt that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> offer you an unmatched user experience — complete with features like top-tier cameras and wireless charging — these devices don&apos;t come cheap. If you can&apos;t (or just don&apos;t want to) spend thousands of dollars on a flagship phone, we suggest taking a look at one of the many options available under the $300 price point. Sure, these do miss out on some nice-to-have features found in expensive phones and aren&apos;t supported for long, but they cover all the basics, while also having some extras. So, before making your decision, do take a look at what features you need the most.</p><p>Our top choice is the CMF Phone 1, a brilliant pick at just $200 with an option to upgrade the RAM and storage for $80 more. Even at that price, it&apos;s still a better phone than any other on this list, including a bright and beautiful—but also eye-friendly—OLED display, a powerful processor, the second-best cameras on this list, and a unique modular design that you can 3D print parts for. It&apos;s an unbelievably fun phone that blew me away from the moment I tried it.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget about the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G if you&apos;re looking for some serious long-term value. While the processor isn&apos;t the fastest on this list, it has the longest software support promise of them all—5 years! That means it&apos;ll see Android 18 before Samsung drops support, something that no other phone on the list can claim. That&apos;s great if you like to hold on to your phones for a long time.</p><p>Lastly, if we&apos;re comparing affordable phones with those that aren&apos;t so affordable, we can&apos;t ignore the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024). This thing comes with a swanky vegan leather back panel and an integrated stylus that makes it look and feel extremely premium. There&apos;s even NFC support for contactless payments, another feature that&apos;s commonly found in flagship phones.</p>

<p>Testing phones at Android Central involves much more than simply booting up a device to ensure it works. We can use phones with a consumer mindset because <em>we</em> <em>are consumers, </em>in addition to Android enthusiasts and product testers. Unlike some sites that rely solely on benchmark programs and lab tests to verify performance, we use smartphones in real-life scenarios to better understand how a device will perform during normal, day-to-day use. </p><p>This involves personally hitting the streets to see how a phone&apos;s camera will perform during the day <em>and </em>night, and comparing pictures from two devices side by side to see how they differ. Our testing involves running multiple performance-heavy apps simultaneously to see if a phone will overheat or swiftly lose battery life. It involves booting up graphics-intensive games at the highest settings to see if the images will lag or stutter, and it means draining the battery of a phone to zero to test the speed at which it will recharge. </p><p>This barely scratches the surface of every testing metric we apply to each new device, so check out our guide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-we-test-and-review-phones-at-android-central">how Android Central tests and reviews phones</a> to learn more. </p>

<p>Reading your favorite book on an E Ink tablet is much easier on your eyes than a traditional tablet thanks to paper-like E Ink displays. The best E Ink tablets offer a mix of useful features beyond the purpose of just reading. You can use them for all sorts of things such as drawing, writing, listening to audiobooks, and exploring the internet.</p><p>The best E Ink tablet that offers all these features in one unified body is the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro, the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</a>. It has a large and beautiful screen that can display color and has writing functionality that delivers a satisfying pen-and-paper feel. As a bonus, it also has keyboard support! If you love the look and feel of traditional reading and writing mediums, this tablet will surely capture your heart. There are plenty more e-paper tabs out there, but the Tab Ultra C Pro gives you the most value for money and performs consistently well.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in this curious blend of traditional and modern mediums, I&apos;ve rounded off the best options available to you right now. As a certified book nerd slash geek (and proud of it), I have always been a huge fan of E Ink technology. The ability to carry hundreds and thousands of books around in a sleek tablet is the stuff seven-year-old me would have drooled over. Twenty years later, I&apos;m still drooling over the latest mind-boggling e-paper devices. My love for this branch of tech and my experience testing dozens of models from various brands are two very good reasons for you to trust my expertise.</p>

<p>While most E Ink displays tend to focus on doing one thing, the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro does it all. Successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Tab Ultra C</a>, the Tab Ultra C Pro displays 4,096 colors on its 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display, which is unusual for most E Ink tablets. Thanks to the accompanying stylus, you can view in full color and even draw, highlight, or jot down notes in different shades. The Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s touch function for the stylus is powered by Wacom, the company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-drawing-tablets">best drawing tablets</a>. It imitates the traditional blue feel of writing on paper with a pen.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox really took things to the next level by adding more gear under the Tab Ultra C Pro&apos;s hood. This stunningly slim tablet runs Android 12 out of the box so that you can install and use apps from the Google Play Store. It has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of onboard storage, a microSD slot, a 16MP camera, stereo speakers, a mic, a USB Type-C port that supports fast charging, and a set of speakers. Amazingly, the 4,600mAh battery can last for a week or two with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in full use. The Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the complete package; it is almost a full-blown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you want the complete package, you&apos;ll have to pay for it since this tablet isn&apos;t exactly cheap in comparison to "normal" tablets. It also lacks water and dust resistance, which is a bummer, and E Ink displays are famously dim in the sun. We believe you can live with these shortcomings as the combination of features in the Tab Ultra C Pro is just too good. Unlike competitors such as the Kindle Scribe, it provides more value and has so much more to offer.</p>

<p>For many years, Amazon has dominated the e-reader market with its Kindle line of reading tablets, and for a good reason: Kindle e-readers are excellent devices, and their displays have LED backlighting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-11th-gen-review">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">best Amazon Kindle e-reader</a>, which makes it the best E Ink tablet for reading.</p>
<p>The 2021 iteration of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite has IPX8 waterproof certification, so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting it wet. It also has five adjustable LED backlights, so it&apos;s fairly bright in sunlight. Its 6-inch 300ppi E Ink screen is a delight to look at and replicates paper very nicely. Audible integration makes it the perfect companion for lazy beach days when you want to sunbathe with your eyes closed. You can connect a pair of Bluetooth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> and listen to audiobooks in peace.</p>
<p>Amazon introduced many different colors for the Kindle Paperwhite, so you have a lot of variety. There&apos;s 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, which is enough to store thousands of e-books. The battery life is excellent, and you get a USB-C charging port. Amazon sweetened the deal by setting a low price, but you&apos;ll need to spend a little extra cash for the ad-free version. If you&apos;re an avid reader, you won&apos;t be disappointed by the Kindle Paperwhite. Some file formats aren&apos;t supported, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazons-kindle-e-readers-will-finally-support-the-most-popular-ebook-format">Amazon did introduce EPUB</a> compatibility to compensate.</p>

<p>At $500, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C improves on the fantastic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a> by retaining its value-packed features but bumping the display to a colorful one. Onyx Boox tablets beat Amazon, Kobo, and every competitor easily because they all have the Google Play Store and run Android 12.</p>
<p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C has a 10.3-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display that can produce 4096 colors and has excellent contrast and a lovely crispness to it. It comes with a battery-free stylus that registers 4,096 degrees of pressure, and you get native optical character recognition (OCR). This is such a vital feature for any tablet, whether it&apos;s an e-ink device or a full-blown traditional Android or iOS tablet. You also get native OCR or handwriting recognition and conversion with the Note Air 3 C, something even the Kindle Scribe doesn&apos;t offer properly.</p>
<p>Apart from the stylus and excellent e-paper screen, the Note Air 3 C has all the advantages of e-ink tablets and e-readers, as well as a few extras. Its 3,700mAh cell provides weeks of battery life, and it has a USB-C port with OTG support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, support for tons of file formats, speakers, and even a microphone! You can even buy a keyboard case separately to enable typing input.</p>
<p>When looking for a writing tablet with an e-paper display, the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C is easily the winning contender. This is saying something, considering the Note Air 3 C&apos;s foes include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-vs-remarkable-2">Amazon Kindle Scribe and the ReMarkable 2</a>. If you don&apos;t mind the lack of water resistance and the need to buy the keyboard case separately, this is the e-ink tablet to get for $500.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Onyx Boox Palma</a> is more of an E Ink smartphone than an E Ink tablet. It has a compact form factor enabling you to carry it around with you in your pocket. The sub-$300 price tag might feel a bit high for the size, and you could easily get a basic entry-level Kindle for less than half the price. However, no Kindle comes with the Google Play Store, which is only one of the many enticing draws of the Boox Palma.</p><p>The Boox Palma has a microphone, speakers, and all the fancy schmancy connectivity options that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">full-fledged Android tablets</a> have, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The only connectivity feature missing is cellular support really.</p><p>You get Android 11 and the Google Play Store pre-installed, granting you access to millions of apps. And because the device uses a B&W E Ink display, the battery literally lasts for months! The 128GB of native storage is insane, but if that somehow isn&apos;t enough for you, you also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">get a microSD card</a> slot and USB-C OTG support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-thumb-drives">USB-C thumb drives</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to find another handheld e-ink device that&apos;s this capable because honestly, there isn&apos;t one!

<p>E Ink tablet lovers out there on a budget can still get one for a nifty price. The entry-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle (2022)</a> is a budget e-reader sporting a 6-inch 300ppi e-paper display. It doesn&apos;t have many fancy features like a waterproof rating or Sudoku, but it can support a healthy number of file formats and looks brilliant.</p>
<p>It isn&apos;t that bright in sunlight, but the adjustable front light is handy for reading at night. The basic Amazon Kindle has some more no-nonsense specs like 16GB of storage, fantastic battery life, Wi-Fi, and audiobook support. If you don&apos;t want to use the Kindle app, you can transfer files to the Amazon Kindle (2022) e-reader from your PC.</p>
<p>In comparison to almost every other e-paper device out there, the Amazon Kindle is the winner, hands down, when it comes to price. The base model Kindle performs a tad bit slower, and it doesn&apos;t have waterproofing, but it is still the best E Ink tablet for reading on a tight budget.</p>

<p>Onyx Boox has ventured into all corners of the e-paper tablet world, giving us the tiniest of devices like the Boox Palma and the biggest of slabs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-x-review">Onyx Boox Tab X</a>. This gigantic 13.3-inch E Ink tablet doesn&apos;t display color, but the viewing experience is sublime nonetheless. This is the most premium Android tablet with an E Ink display made by the brand.</p><p>I tested the Tab X and was very impressed by its thinness and lightweight build. The tablet is quite literally as slim as a tea biscuit! And this narrow waist does not impede the tablet&apos;s performance in any way. Apart from that, the Tab X comes with all the signature features of Onyx Boox devices such as Android, the Play Store, a speaker, a mic, and a stylus.</p><p>If the 128GB of onboard storage isn&apos;t enough for all your documents, e-books, graphic novels, and apps, then the USB-C OTG feature should help you expand the storage even further. There&apos;s no microSD slot, but that shouldn&apos;t be a big issue all things considered. The one major drawback here is the morbidly expensive price tag. If you can afford it, you won&apos;t have much to complain about.</p>

<p>An E Ink tablet with a color display for less than $300? No, you're not dreaming. The cheap and cheerful Bigme B751C Color makes this possible, getting you a 7-inch E INK Carta 1200 display with a stylus, Android 11, and a microSD slot at an agreeable price. The UI isn't as smooth or intuitive as Onyx Boox, but the low price demands some compromise.</p></p>

The price isn't the best, but the battery life and build quality are excellent.</p></p>

<h2 id="the-best-all-around-e-ink-tablet-is-multifunctional-2">The best all-around E Ink tablet is multifunctional</h2>
<p>After staring at bright screens day in and day out, your eyes really need a break. The best E Ink tablet not only provides relief but also allows you to carry out various tasks. Pick one based on your specific needs. If you intend to read basic ebooks, an entry-level e-reader should be fine. But, if you intend to do more like drawing and taking notes, take your use cases into consideration before making a final choice.</p><p>The Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro is the best E Ink tablet owing to its fabulous soft colors, extremely sleek and lightweight build, and multitasking capabilities. It isn&apos;t limited to just being an e-reader, but if you want, you can use it for that purpose. But if need be, you can also use it to take down notes, sketch some lovely drawings, or underline passages of text.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s also not forget that you get native optical character recognition with the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C Pro, enabling you to convert your handwriting into digital text in real-time, whether it&apos;s to use the search bar in the Google Play Store or to use the search function in your handwritten notes. This alone is a remarkable feat for any decent tablet with a stylus.</p>
<p>The Tab Ultra C Pro accommodates office use as well as home use. You don&apos;t have to sacrifice battery life or connectivity. It even has stereo speakers and a mic, which no other electronic ink tablet on this list offers. What&apos;s even more brilliant is its ability to run almost any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android app</a>. You can actually use it as a full-fledged tablet for most tasks related to reading and writing. The Tab Ultra C Pro pushes the boundaries of an E Ink tablet in the best sense, which is why it is the best one you can buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>A top OnePlus executive has confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> will debut in China next month, featuring the latest high-end mobile processor.</p><p>Traditionally, OnePlus drops its flagship phones in December for the Chinese market, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-earlier-fall-launch-rumors">things are changing this year</a>. Louis Lee, OnePlus China’s president, announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/Ow9ZyvUb7" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the OnePlus 13 is set to launch a bit ahead of schedule—this October (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/09/oneplus-13-release-date-performance-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Along with the surprise October launch, Lee also shared some juicy details about the upcoming handset. It’s going to run on the newest flagship processor with a custom design from the same team behind cutting-edge PC chips. This means a new dual-core setup that&apos;s set to blow away the competition and set new industry standards, according to a machine translation for Lee&apos;s post.</p><p>That’s likely the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, set to be revealed in October. With the timing aligning so neatly, it’s almost a sure bet that the OnePlus 13 will be the first phone to flaunt this new powerhouse.</p><p>Anyway, unlike its predecessor, which saw the light of day in December 2023 and went global in January of this year, the next-gen device is making its debut much earlier.</p><p>The upcoming Qualcomm processor features custom Oryon CPU cores, the same tech that was used in its Snapdragon X PC chips.</p><p>According to Lee, the OnePlus 13 might be able to handle the demanding graphics of Genshin Impact at a high refresh rate of 120fps.</p><p>Rumor has it OnePlus&apos; next contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> will up its camera game with three 50MP sensors on the back, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">including one with 3x optical zoom</a>. Plus, it’ll keep teaming up with Hasselblad for that extra photography flair.</p><p>Notably, this camera system echoes the stellar setup on the Oppo Find X7 Ultra, so expect some top-notch photography.</p><p>Earlier leaks have already given us a sneak peek at the OnePlus 13’s features. We’re looking at a revamped camera design, a huge 6.8-inch 2K screen, and a hefty battery over 6,000mAh.</p><p>No matter what the final specs are, we won’t have to wait long to find out since the launch has been moved up by a couple of months.</p>

You shouldn&apos;t expect a major performance boost or new health sensors. But I can&apos;t stress enough how significant those few changes feel, particularly the new 45mm size and enlarged displays. They feel like two of the final puzzle pieces to make the Pixel Watch 3 an A-tier device.</p><p>This Google Pixel Watch 3 review is more of a collaborative effort than usual. Android Central&apos;s Senior Phones Editor Nick Sutrich and Managing Editor Derrek Lee both received their own Pixel Watch 3s, to pair with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> review units, respectively. So I grilled both on their Pixel Watch 3 perspectives, and I&apos;m including their thoughts alongside my own.</p><p>Even though we&apos;ve each only had a couple of weeks with the Watch 3, our collective impression is pretty consistent: This is a fantastic Wear OS watch that looks as stylish as ever, and the new software perks are a welcome addition. Other Wear OS watches do much better for battery life, but Google&apos;s spec sheet significantly undersells how long the Pixel Watch 3 lasts.</p><p>Did Google do enough to dethrone the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> of the year? Honestly, it&apos;s much more subjective than you might think.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 ships tomorrow, September 10. The Pixel Watch 3 41mm costs $349 / £349 / €399 / CA$479 / AU$579, or $449 / £449 / €499 / CA$599 / AU$749 with LTE support. </p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 45mm costs $399 / £399 / €449 / CA$549 / AU$669, or $499 / £499 / €549 / CA$669 / AU$839. Generally speaking, rivals like Apple or Samsung will charge $30 for a larger display or $50 for LTE support, making Google&apos;s upcharges a bit pricier.</p><p>Google sells the Pixel Watch 3 in 32 countries or territories, compared to 21 countries for the Pixel Watch 2; you can see the supported list at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652073?hl=en">Google Support</a>. Of this list, some countries can only buy the Wi-Fi version, including India. </p><p>With the Pixel Watch 3 4G/LTE version, you get two years of complimentary data, but only up to 500MB before data speeds are capped to 256KB/s until the 1GB max. You&apos;ll need to add the Watch 3 to your carrier to enable standalone voice calling and unlimited music streaming. Google Fi lets you do so for free, while most other carriers will charge a monthly fee before you can add your phone number to it. That same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652073?hl=en">Google Support link</a> shows a list of compatible carriers.</p>

<p>As I said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 3 vs. 2</a> isn&apos;t all that different, but it fixed minor drawbacks that made the Pixel Watch 2 feel last-gen, like updating from Bluetooth 5.0 to 5.3 for better efficiency, adding Wi-Fi 5GHz for faster downloads, speeding up the charging speed a bit, and expanding the thick-bordered display. </p><p>Beyond that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> earned its 4.5/5 review score, and positives like its fast performance and unique, stylish design still hold true a year later. Google didn&apos;t need to make drastic changes to satisfy us, merely to show that they were paying attention to the details. </p><p>So, what&apos;s new and significant that we love about the Pixel Watch 3?</p>
<h2 id="both-google-pixel-watch-3-sizes-look-and-feel-fantastic-2">Both Google Pixel Watch 3 sizes look and feel fantastic</h2>

<p>Google designed Wear OS 3+ to mask the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>&apos;s ultra-thick display border with black-bordered tiles and watch faces. Now, both Pixel Watch 3 sizes stretch near the rounded edge, and not only does it look fantastic, but it fits significantly more information. Not to mention it doubled the display brightness and refresh rate.</p><p>Although Google doesn&apos;t explain this on its Pixel Watch 3 store page for some reason, the 41mm watch display adds an extra 1.7mm in diameter for a subtle but noticeable visual boost. The 45mm Pixel Watch 3 measures 4mm wider (1.43 inches total), and the shift from the old 384x384 resolution to 456x456 is stark.</p><p>Most of the Android Central staff prefers the 45mm size. Andrew Myrick called the 41mm "too dainty" in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3 hands-on</a>, while Derrek Lee called the 45mm "a massive improvement" because of how much more data it can fit on screen. But Nick Sutrich specifically asked for the 41mm because he grew accustomed to a smaller size, and he feels the 1.27-inch model has more than enough space while saving money.</p>

<p>Though I&apos;ve grown accustomed to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>&apos;s vivid 3,000-nit brightness, the Pixel Watch 3 is perfectly serviceable at 2,000 nits. I know I <em>couldn&apos;t</em> have adapted easily to the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, but the 45mm model matches my needs. Wear OS 5 auto-adjusts to the larger display size and squeezes more info into it, which is a nice touch.</p><p>Whichever you pick, the Pixel Watch 3 has a natural comfort to it. The bottom sensor doesn&apos;t jut into my skin, and the 69g/ 2.43oz weight is pretty standard for a proper smartwatch, if not exactly "light." The default Active band has a comfortable fluoroelastomer material; the snap-and-tuck design can tug at your arm hair a bit, but once it&apos;s secured, there&apos;s no worry about wobbling.</p>

<p>There aren&apos;t many Wear OS brands left, but Mobvoi, OnePlus, and Samsung all sell watches that last at least three days per charge. So when Google&apos;s Pixel Watch 3 spec sheet promised the same 24 hours with AOD active, that felt insufficient!</p><p>It turns out Google may be selling itself short. Even with AOD active, my 45mm Pixel Watch 3 has made it for two days, including 2–3 hours of GPS tracking and two nights of sleep tracking with all sensors active. And whenever the battery runs low, I can bring it back up to 50% in less than 30 minutes, enough for another active day.</p><p>I&apos;ll have a more definitive answer on battery life in a month with my full Pixel Watch 3 review, with more testing time. For now, I&apos;m cautiously optimistic.</p><p>Both Nick and Derrek, who wore the Pixel Watch 2 consistently, claim the Pixel Watch 3 is better for battery life, even though the 41mm capacity is unchanged. I suspect this is thanks in part to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5 efficiency updates</a>, particularly the new XML watch face format and the new Hybrid Interface using less energy for tracking health and workout data.</p><p>Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> both cost less, have the same 1.43-inch display size, and last a day or two longer than the Pixel Watch 3; I personally prefer Garmin watches that last weeks at a time. So "long battery life" is relative, and Google&apos;s still behind the pack. But it&apos;s not as bad as I feared, and so far it&apos;s about on par with the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s 40-to-48 hours of capacity.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T7ZTTjGYfLJqgLNv4Cjk88" name="fitbit-premium-sleep-tracking.jpg" alt="Fitbit app showing a sleep score summary, HRV, breathing rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, and other data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7ZTTjGYfLJqgLNv4Cjk88.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m still frustrated that Google has essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">killed Fitbit as a hardware brand</a>, making the Pixel Watch 3 its only future smartwatch option instead of offering longer-lasting Fitbit Sense or Versa models. But I&apos;ll admit that it was smart of Google to steal Fitbit&apos;s sensors and software for its lineup, because it leaves every other brand struggling to close the gap for health insights.</p><p>With my usual disclaimer that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hate wearing a smartwatch at night</a>, I&apos;ve managed to wear the Pixel Watch 3 enough to get a sense of its sleep-tracking accuracy. Its sleep stages and awake periods match my actual sleep patterns, and its health metrics like breathing rate, HRV, SpO2, and skin temperature focus more on averages and variation than on trying to shame or stress you out with "abnormal" data compared to other people.</p><p>The body response and stress management data seems much more responsive to actual stress and agitation than most watches relying solely on HRV. And while I have no signs of AFib issues, I like that it automatically and passively tests for irregular rhythm and high/low HR data, without restricting the results like Samsung does with its Galaxy-only Health Monitor app. The same applies to the Loss of Pulse feature, which will auto-dial emergency services in response to cardiac arrest; while other brands have fall detection, this is a welcome bit of reassurance for elderly buyers.</p><p>Add in Cardio Load and workout recommendations for athletes, and Fitbit is a tempting option, especially since most of its insights don&apos;t require Premium once the 6-month free trial ends.</p>

<p>Google added some intriguing new software tools to the Pixel Watch 3. Covering each would be an article in itself, so I&apos;ll simply summarize the list and then highlight my favorites.</p><p><strong>New Pixel Watch 3 software features: </strong>Morning Brief, Google TV remote controls, Nest Camera controls, Google Home tile, offline Google Maps, Call Assist holds, Ultra Wideband watch unlock, Pixel Recorder tile, Submersion detection, Loss of Pulse, Auto Bedtime mode.</p><p>Of these, several require other Google or smart home devices, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review">Nest Doorbell</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV</a>. In particular, the UWB unlock feature only works with the Pixel 7/8/9 Pro models, the Pixel Recorder app saves on the watch but can only upload recordings to Pixels, and the Hold for Me feature is Pixel-exclusive, too.</p><p>Our Pixel Watch 2 reviewer specifically praised that "Google didn&apos;t hold back certain features if you have a non-Pixel phone," so he might find this shift disappointing. Even though I use a Samsung phone and couldn&apos;t test some of these tools, I didn&apos;t necessarily mind because I liked what I <em>could</em> test or see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-nest-cam-live-feed.jpeg" alt="Nest Doorbell live feed on the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t have a Nest Cam, but Nick Sutrich tested the feature for me, finding it almost as responsive as checking the livestreams on his phone (Bluetooth adds a slight delay). He loves the ease of checking who&apos;s there at any time, in case his phone isn&apos;t on hand.</p><p>Morning Brief is very similar to the Garmin Morning Report I&apos;m used to. It starts out pretty simple with sleep insights, weather, exercise progress, and warnings about out-of-range health metrics. With enough sleep tracking, you&apos;ll start to see daily readiness, target load, and a recommended workout. It&apos;s all quite useful and well summarized, and I only wish you could <em>recheck</em> your brief later — but it vanishes once you&apos;re done.</p><p>I don&apos;t have much of a smart home, but I do find I&apos;m more apt to play with my smart lights now that I can access them quickly in the Google Home tile instead of pulling out my phone. As for Google TV, it&apos;s less convenient than simply using your remote control, but does come in handy in case you lose it.</p>

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">How I test</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">For GPS accuracy, I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, which beat other dual-band GPS watches from COROS, Polar, Samsung, and Apple in previous tests. For testing optical HR accuracy, I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a>, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">compared favorably</a> against a HRM chest strap.</p></div></div>
<p>Google claims the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running" compared to past Pixel Watches. Unfortunately, Google didn&apos;t add dual-band GPS to it, as Samsung did with the Galaxy Watch 7. Some GPS-only watches are more accurate than others, but with Google emphasizing its new Fitbit running tools, I had to put both metrics to the test.</p><p>In my limited timeframe, I took the Pixel Watch 3 out for one normal 10K run, one track workout, and two rucks (aka hiking with weights). Here&apos;s what I learned, starting with heart rate. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.80%;"><img id="jeakeSWkwfQEv3s3gdm68L" name="pixel-watch-3-10k-run-heart-rate-test.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing results from the Pixel Watch 3 and a COROS Heart Rate Monitor connected to the Garmin Forerunner 965." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jeakeSWkwfQEv3s3gdm68L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1680" height="887" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a normal run, the Google Pixel Watch 3 does pretty well for a wrist-based optical HR sensor. It stayed within 1 beat per minute (bpm) of my COROS arm band at most points. Most wrist-based sensors struggle with light artifacts and have difficulty with sudden HR changes, but Google&apos;s algorithm has it step-for-step. Still, its 158 bpm average was one short of both COROS and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, which became a trend.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.77%;"><img id="mmDTDkBzUCwYu5t4ZDczVL" name="pixel-watch-3-10m-hike-heart-rate-test.jpeg" alt="A heart rate chart showing results from the Pixel Watch 3 and a COROS Heart Rate Monitor connected to the Garmin Forerunner 965." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mmDTDkBzUCwYu5t4ZDczVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1680" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Across my 10-mile ruck with plenty of hills and valleys, it showed similar responsiveness, immediately catching my heart rate changes. At the same time, the final bpm average was three short of COROS (134 vs. 131); a few days prior, I did a 6-mile ruck and there was a similar HR average gap between COROS and Google (135 vs. 132).</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 continues tracking HR when you pause, whereas other brands tend to freeze the reading until you restart. That&apos;s why the Pixel Watch 3 workout is slightly longer in the charts above: I didn&apos;t realize I was still "working out." That may be one contributing factor to the HR average being lower.</p><p>Finally, my track workout was a bit of a mixed bag. For each hard lap, Google stayed on track up to about 180 bpm, only to lag behind the COROS band by about 3–5 bpm for 30-second stretches before it started to catch up. For what it&apos;s worth, most mainstream watches I&apos;ve tested struggle with anaerobic tracking, including the Galaxy Watch Ultra, so this isn&apos;t a specific Pixel Watch 3 problem.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s GPS-only accuracy was a bit of a mess, which I feared but expected. You can see in the screenshots above how Google (orange) throws my position all over the place, especially in the wild first example. Most commonly, it&apos;s parallel to Garmin&apos;s dual-band GPS, but significantly off to the side, which leads to losing or gaining distance artificially on turns. After a 10K, it lost about eight-hundredths of a mile, pretty standard for a GPS-only watch.</p><p>For hiking, the wobbly tracking led to massive overestimates on how far I&apos;d hiked. The line itself wasn&apos;t <em>that</em> far off, but on my route a stray line suggests I&apos;m climbing off-trail up hills or down steep cliffs. Where Garmin matched my AllTrails route, the Pixel Watch 3 added an extra 0.25mi and 0.4mi to my 6-mile and 10-mile hikes, respectively.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JFEinvHnr69Bpsq56CYyM8" name="fitbit-premium-create-running-workout.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing how to create a run workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFEinvHnr69Bpsq56CYyM8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, I&apos;d give the Pixel Watch 3 a B for heart rate accuracy — good enough for general calorie and training load data, but not for serious athletes — and a C average for GPS data. It&apos;s a shame, because the new Fitbit running software is a fantastic pivot (if not quite "A" worthy).</p><p>Creating running workouts is very easy once you get the hang of it, with criteria like distance or calories burned. My personal favorite is the Time Trial workout where you set a distance and time to finish it, which adds a sense of urgency. You <em>can</em> make workouts on the watch in a pinch, but adding targets like pace or heart rate zone — or deleting intervals — is far easier in the mobile Fitbit app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i5sqswBcpi6rvm8iUKs6b8" name="fitbit-premium-run-analysis.jpg" alt="Fitbit post-run analysis showing heart rate zones, running form analysis, GPS map, and other data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i5sqswBcpi6rvm8iUKs6b8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fitbit provides a decent amount of post-run data, including running form analysis, heart rate zones, and elevation gain. It <em>doesn&apos;t</em> have some popular tools like running power, aerobic/anaerobic training effect, or sweat loss, but it&apos;s more than enough for casual runners.</p><p>I&apos;m also a fan of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> system, which puts more emphasis on weekly and monthly progress than trying to hit Active Zone Minutes every day (especially when you&apos;re burned out from a hard workout). It&apos;s particularly cool how it&apos;ll track your training load from any task where your heart rate is elevated or you get steps, not just tracked workouts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PSsjoRfekDspxxm3YQmHn8" name="fitbit-premium-cardio-load-and-daily-readiness.jpg" alt="Fitbit app screenshots showing the user's daily readiness and cardio load scores." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSsjoRfekDspxxm3YQmHn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparing its training load against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">other brands&apos; training load</a>, Fitbit puts more stock on a workout&apos;s length than its intensity. I only got 37 cardio load for six hard laps at the track at a 170 bpm average, then 30 for my 30-minute walk home; Garmin gave me over 200 for the track workout, but maybe 10 load for the walk. For my ten-mile hike with 2,300 feet climbed and 20lb. on my back, Google tracked 230 cardio load when Garmin gave me a paltry 110.</p><p>In other words, I&apos;d say that Cardio Load, despite its name, is actually a better indicator of my <em>muscular</em> soreness than Garmin, while Garmin puts more stock on peak/ anaerobic effort and scoffs at low-intensity workouts. You can decide which works better for you!</p><p>Fitbit&apos;s other big innovation is "Target Load," suggesting how much Cardio Load you should get on a given day based on your daily readiness and past workouts. Because you need 7–14 days of consistent sleep data before Fitbit will start making a target, I couldn&apos;t test this just yet. I&apos;ll have more to say with the full review, though I will note that other brands will just default to assuming you slept normally and recommend workouts anyway. I personally would prefer that, even if it&apos;s not as "smart" of a recommendation.</p>

<p>Having polled the Android Central team, we have very few major complaints about the Google Pixel Watch 3. We&apos;d like it to last longer, but that was a longshot with the same CPU and design, since you&apos;d need extra battery capacity. It&apos;s a shame to see more Pixel-exclusive features, but that&apos;s a trend that applies to Apple and Samsung watches, too.</p><p>I got conflicting feedback from Nick and Derrek about the crown. Derrek said the crown haptics "are not as...satisfying, like they&apos;ve been downgraded," while Nick praised the crown as being subtly better than the Watch 2&apos;s. As the tiebreaker, I&apos;ll say that I like using it instead of a Galaxy Watch&apos;s digital bezel, but agree that there are times that it feels a little more unresponsive than I&apos;d like.</p><p>Most of our Pixel Watch 3 complaints pertain to missing features we&apos;d like to see in future Pixel Watch hardware or Wear OS software updates, since it&apos;s essentially the flagship for testing new Android wearable hardware. Here&apos;s what we&apos;d want fixed or improved in future models.</p>

<p>Based on all of the data above, my requests for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> are fairly predictable: It needs to have dual-band GPS, extra LEDs to add better HR hardware on top of the excellent algorithm, and a continued focus on fitness data.</p><p>Specifically, since Wear OS 5 added offline maps for casual navigation, the next step is for Wear OS 6 to allow for people to make and share GPX courses via Google Maps that you can download to your watch for offline navigation. That would be an amazing trick that would intrude directly on Garmin&apos;s territory as the watch hikers rely on for maps and trailheads.</p><p>Google could also move beyond runners — as much as I appreciate the pandering — and add more dedicated workout-building tools for strength training and cycling. At the moment, both Nick and Derrek have said the new running tools don&apos;t affect them much, since they&apos;re not runners, but both are regular gym-goers and would appreciate more focus on tracking reps, muscle maps for exercises, and so on.</p>

<p>As long as Google keeps its edge-to-edge design, the Pixel Watch series may never achieve the same military-grade durability rating as the Galaxy Watch series or other rugged watches. But at the very least, I&apos;d hoped the Pixel Watch 3 would have sapphire glass, like so many other modern smartwatches; its Gorilla Glass 5 layer is fine for basic scratches, but you&apos;ll want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/theres-a-big-problem-with-google-pixel-watch-3-repairs-replacements">Digital Trends</a> reported that the Pixel Watch 3 is essentially unrepairable and can&apos;t be reassembled if you take it apart. If you pay $4/month or $89 for the Pixel Preferred Care program — which isn&apos;t available in every country — you can get it repaired, but Google won&apos;t actually <em>repair</em> it, just send you a new one.</p><p>Even though Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-is-winning-the-right-to-repair-race-with-pixel-9-series-manuals-and-guides">taking right-to-repair seriously</a> for its new phones, that doesn&apos;t apply yet to its smartwatches. And if we&apos;re going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech">call smart rings "disposable tech"</a> because they can&apos;t be repaired, then that applies to this watch, too. Google should make the Pixel Watch 4 repairable, as the Apple and Galaxy Watches are.</p><p>Lastly, Google has confirmed that the Pixel Watch 3 will receive three years of timely Wear OS and security updates. That&apos;s certainly better than Mobvoi or OnePlus offer, but Samsung&apos;s promise of four Wear OS updates has Google beat, and the Galaxy Watch series costs less. It&apos;s a shame that the Google Pixel Watch 3 will lose support in late 2027 when the Pixel 9 will last until fall 2031.</p>

<p>The immediate, obvious Pixel Watch 3 competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. We have a full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Pixel Watch 3 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 guide</a> that exhaustively covers every difference, but here are the main points:</p>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 displays are slightly bigger and have sapphire glass, plus the same brightness and refresh rate.</li><li>Samsung relies on its touch bezel instead of a dedicated crown, which works well enough but isn't quite as precise.</li><li>Samsung has a newer 3nm Exynos chip that's clocked lower but has five cores instead of four; performance is pretty comparable, honestly, but Samsung has a slight efficiency edge, so you'll get more hours out of it.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 has dual-band GPS tracking for better accuracy.</li><li>Both run Wear OS 5, but Samsung offers four years of updates instead of three.</li></ul>
<p>Of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> to consider, we&apos;ll point you to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> if you&apos;re especially concerned about battery life. It&apos;s rated to last three or four days per charge and will get a couple of Wear OS updates, though fewer than Google offers. The software isn&apos;t quite as polished as Google&apos;s, especially for health and fitness, but it&apos;s more efficient; it&apos;s more classically stylish, as well as much heavier.</p><p>If you&apos;re considering the Pixel Watch 3 for its health or running features, you could always consider the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a>, which has the same health sensors and will get the same cardio load tracking. It&apos;s not nearly as smart of a watch, but it lasts six days instead of one-ish and does have a couple of Google apps. Otherwise, runners can look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, another fitness watch with weeks of battery life that lacks sophisticated apps but has in-depth training load and suggested workouts without needing a subscription.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You like your Pixel Watch 1/2 but really want a better or larger display.</li><li>You have a Pixel phone and want the best smartwatch integration for features like call screening.</li><li>You're an athlete excited by the combination of health tracking, workout building, and cardio load.</li><li>You're a Wear OS person who cares more about style than durability.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a smartwatch that consistently lasts more than a couple of days.</li><li>You need dual-band GPS for more dependable results.</li></ul>
<p>The first Pixel Watch took years to arrive, and it showed with its dated CPU and limited feature set. It fixed a ton with the Pixel Watch 2 by adding a Snapdragon chip and a ton of Fitbit sensors, but the display still felt like the achilles&apos; heel. </p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is Google&apos;s strongest wearable entry yet. It&apos;s certainly not perfect, and the company has a ways to go still in key areas. I personally have a hard time getting past the simple fact that they didn&apos;t add dual-band GPS for a watch with so much emphasis on running software. But none of its flaws are deal-breakers.</p><p>While the Galaxy Watch 7 has an objective edge over the Pixel Watch 3 in a few ways, no one can deny that Google&apos;s design just <em>looks better</em>. Style matters for a smartwatch, and I could see plenty of Android fans picking the Pixel Watch 3 for that reason alone.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 comes in two sizes for the first time, while doubling its display brightness and adding a 60Hz LTPO panel for smoother transitions and better battery life while using AOD mode. It comes with six months of Fitbit Premium, but most of its best new tools like Daily Readiness, Cardio Load, Target Load, and custom workouts don't require a subscription. It launches with Wear OS 5 and should receive Wear OS 8 in 2027. Google is racing to catch up with Samsung for wearables, and the Pixel Watch 3 proves that it's closing the gap.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TCL just launched the 50 and 50 Pro NXTPAPER smartphones, both designed to ease eye strain with its new display tech.</li><li>Both phones include a "NXTPAPER key" that offers two modes: Ink Paper for regular reading and Max Ink for a distraction-free experience, promising over a week of battery life.</li><li>Both models feature a 6.8-inch 1080p screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the Pro version has slightly better specs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TCL has unveiled the 50 and 50 Pro NXTPAPER smartphones, both of which aim to cut down on eye strain with TCL&apos;s new display tech. And despite their different names, they share a lot of the same features.</p><p>At IFA 2024, TCL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-announces-revolutionary-smart-devices-and-ai-collaboration-with-microsoft-at-ifa-2024-302239122.html" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the 50 NXTPAPER and 50 PRO NXTPAPER. These hybrids pack TCL&apos;s anti-glare display and a handy reading mode button, blending smartphone and e-reader features into one device.</p><p>The NXTPAPER key has two modes: Ink Paper and Max Ink. Just flip the key to the first position for Ink Paper Mode and push it one notch further for Max Ink Mode. Max Ink is perfect for focused reading, as it turns off notifications but keeps internet, calls, and texts active. TCL says you can expect over a week of battery life in Max Ink mode.</p><p>If this feels like déjà vu, it&apos;s because TCL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-is-bringing-its-innovative-nxtpaper-tech-to-more-phones-and-tablets">rolled out a similar feature on a tablet earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Besides the quasi-E Ink mode, both phones come with a 6.8-inch 1080p screen boasting a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The main difference is that the non-Pro model has a few slightly lower specs.</p><p>Under the hood, both phones draw their power from MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 6300 processor. The TCL 50 NXTPAPER comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, while the TCL 50 Pro NXTPAPER offers a more spacious 512GB. Additionally, both support expandable storage.</p><p>On the back, both phones have a 108MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide, and a 2MP macro lens. The standard model includes an 8MP selfie camera, while the Pro version steps up with a 32MP front sensor.</p><p>The TCL 50 NXTPAPER and 50 Pro NXTPAPER both feature 33W fast charging, NFC, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, and an audio jack. They run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and are guaranteed to receive two OS upgrades and security patches until 2029.</p><p>TCL&apos;s new NXTPAPER phones seem designed for those who crave a less distracting smartphone experience. However, only time will tell if they truly deliver on this promise.</p><p>The TCL 50 Pro NXTPAPER will retail in Europe and Latin America for €299, with optional accessories included. Meanwhile, the TCL 50 NXTPAPER will be available in Europe for €229.</p>

<ul><li>Starting with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6, the Samsung Messages app is no longer pre-installed on Samsung devices. </li><li>Now, the company appears to be prompting users to switch to Google Messages as their default SMS app.</li><li>While the Samsung Messages app is not immediately being discontinued entirely, all signs point to Google Messages being the future messaging app of One UI. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>For better or for worse, using a Samsung Galaxy phone has historically meant living with duplicate default apps. Of course, Google includes default versions of its own apps, like the Chrome browser. On top of that, Samsung might include an alternate app as part of its One UI skin for Android, like Samsung Internet. You’ll notice quickly after switching to a Galaxy phone that there are multiple apps for the same function, and this is far less common on other phones.</p><p>One example is Samsung Messages, which serves as an SMS app in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. Originally, Samsung Messages was set as the default for Galaxy devices, but that changed a few years ago. Even after Samsung started shipping Galaxy phones with Google Messages as the default SMS app, the Samsung Messages app was still pre-installed as an alternative. That <em>finally</em> changed this summer, when the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 released without Samsung Messages pre-installed.</p><p>That move led many to believe that Samsung was slowly preparing to send its Messages app off into the sunset. While an immediate discontinuation doesn’t seem to be in the cards, Samsung does appear to be moving away from Samsung Messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/03/samsung-pushing-galaxy-users-to-google-messages/">9to5Google</a>). As noted by users on social media sites, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1f3mby8/help_please/?share_id=HxVMfIC-v2666UJznaHwH&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, a recent Samsung Messages update is prompting users to switch to Google Messages.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1f3mby8/help_please">Help please</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The prompt pushes users to set Google Messages as their default SMS app. If they choose to give Google Messages a try, their Samsung Messages history can be imported to the new default app. However, some users report that syncing hundreds or thousands of messages can be an excruciating process that results in Google Messages slowing to a crawl in the short term.</p><p>This push is the latest urging Samsung Messages users to try Google Messages. Some people have been moving to Google Messages on their own accord now that it’s the default messaging app for Galaxy devices and One UI. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> support in Samsung Messages can be hit-or-miss, as it’s carrier-dependent. Compared to the full-fledged RCS support in Google Messages, Samsung Messages is lagging behind. Now that Samsung is clearly moving away from the app, it might not ever catch up.</p><p>Between Samsung’s apparent push for Google Messages and Apple’s impending support of RCS, which will work best in Google Messages, there’s good reason to switch. It feels like only a matter of time before Samsung Messages is sunset altogether. For now, it’s worth emphasizing that the app is still kicking and users can still continue to use it.</p>

<p>I have no stake in the Samsung Messages versus Google Messages debate, since I’m primarily a Pixel user. Even on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, I stick with Google Messages as it’s the default. But as a longtime hater of the bloat that typically comes with Samsung’s One UI skin of Android, I’m excited about the possibility of there being one less duplicate application on Galaxy phones.</p><p>After testing all kinds of Android phones from all the biggest manufacturers, Samsung delivers the worst software experience, in my opinion. The number of pre-installed, third party apps you’ll find on stock One UI devices is ridiculous — I shouldn’t have to see the Amazon app on my phone unless I choose to install it. When you consider the duplicate apps, like Samsung Calendar and Google Calendar, or Chrome and Samsung Internet, it all adds up to create a bloated experience.</p><p>I get why Samsung wants to offer its own versions of default apps. It has an ecosystem to support, and it might just be the most versatile ecosystem out there. You can buy a Samsung phone, tablet, watch, earbuds, laptop, and even washing machine or TV if you choose. However, the ecosystem software shouldn’t hamper the experience of using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> as, well, phones. Google makes better versions of many, if not all, of Samsung’s default apps. That makes some of them simply redundant. </p><p>Especially of late, Samsung Messages has been a redundant holdover of the early One UI days. Google Messages is better, and Samsung is pushing users away from its own messaging app because it’s for the best. I hope it leads to Samsung Messages being sunset eventually, for simplicity’s sake. Looking broader, I’d love to see Samsung audit its suite of default and pre-installed applications. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">One UI</a> is the most bloated Android skin out there, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>

<p><em><strong>Peter asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I know nothing about Chromebooks apart from the fact that they are cheaper than laptops. I bank online using a laptop. Can I do that on a Chromebook?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Peter! This is such a good question and something a lot of people wonder about. Almost everything you read about Chromebooks talk about the price and how easy they are to use, especially with multiple users. But a lot of basic questions that are important for people to know before they buy one go unanswered.</p><p>The quick answer for you: Yes! A Chromebook offers a secure way to access your bank&apos;s online portal and the website will look and feel — more importantly it will function — exactly the same as it does on your current laptop using a modern and supported web browser like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. </p>
<p>There are some things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">a Chromebook</a> can&apos;t do. You&apos;re not going to run any software built for Windows or Mac, so engineering and design software probably isn&apos;t going to work. </p><p>You also aren&apos;t going to play any graphics-intensive games so all those AAA titles you see online are designed for a Windows PC or a game console.</p><p>You <em>will</em> be able to do almost everything else though, especially anything you do through a web browser. The browser on a Chromebook is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a>; almost the same Google Chrome you can install on Windows or a Mac.</p><p>The differences are how the operating system interacts with the browser and you&apos;ll find even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">a cheap Chromebook</a> without the greatest specs will outperform most other laptops when it comes to browser responsiveness. The Chrome operating system was built from the ground up with the browser — the tool that most people use most of the time — in mind.</p><p>So yes, you can do your online banking, or anything else you do through the web browser, from a Chromebook</p>

<p><em><strong>Ramon asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Before my Grandpa passed away in 1994 he was working on releasing his own album as a mariachi in Mexico. What now remains are a few cassette tape copies of what that album would have been. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I recently came across my Grandpa&apos;s old cassette tape and all looked up production companies associated with the album. All entities associated no longer exist so I&apos;m assuming I&apos;m not attempting to do anything illegal. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>My question to you is, how can I make this cassette tape into a digital format to allow more of the family to have a piece of it as seven cassette tapes are all that remains? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Ramon! I saw your question in my inbox and had to chuckle because I recently did just what you&apos;re asking about! This is so important because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">streaming services</a> might be easy and filled with popular music but a lot of us have those one-of-a-kind tapes of our lives in action. It sounds like you have a handful of those tapes.</p><p>Converting from a cassette to a digital format like mp3 is easy to do in a few different ways. If you have a computer with an audio interface you can use software to "record" the input into a digital file.</p><p>You can also send the cassettes to services that will convert them for you if you&apos;d like someone else to do the work.</p><p>I found it easy to just buy the right tool. I bought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SEMIER-Portable-Converter-Microphone-Headphone/dp/B0D8H5FH6M">this cassette player and converter from Amazon for about $30</a>. I picked this one because I can record to an SD card versus connecting it to my PC and it works great. Just take a few minutes to read the directions and you&apos;re set.</p><p>I hope you and your family can enjoy all of Grandpa&apos;s music!</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-max-power-bank-review">Major Max</a> is a 20000mAh power bank that&apos;s ideally suited if you have a Samsung phone, and Stuffcool is rolling out a new model dubbed the Major Ultra, going up to 65W.</p><p>Obviously, the big differentiator is that the power bank now delivers 65W of power over the USB PD 3.0 protocol. Of course, that comes with the inevitable price hike, with the Major Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Major-Ultra-Charging-Powerbank/dp/B0D5JKBJTQ/">retailing at ₹3,299 ($39) on Amazon India</a> — the Major Max <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Major-Ultra-Charging-Powerbank/dp/B0D5JKBJTQ/">still costs ₹2,299 ($27)</a>. I think the Major Ultra is by far the better choice considering you get 65W charging as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJEH6pmGJqhhD6HMtYvPLj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-9.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJEH6pmGJqhhD6HMtYvPLj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the Major Ultra is a new variant of the Max, the design is identical. The power bank has a silver aesthetic that looks a little cleaner than the basic design of the Major Max, but there&apos;s a lot of obtrusive text and branding on the device that doesn&apos;t cater to my tastes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YhnRsU7S8LSrMrQMs4rhrj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-8.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhnRsU7S8LSrMrQMs4rhrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Major Ultra has a rectangular design, and you get the same LED indicators that highlight remaining battery level. There&apos;s a power button on the right, and a Micro-USB port on the left; like the Major Max, you can use the Micro-USB port to charge the power bank at up to 18W. I don&apos;t get the utility of the Micro-USB port; if you&apos;re like me, you would&apos;ve switched over to USB-C by now, and it&apos;s unlikely that a majority of Stuffcool&apos;s intended userbase would have Micro-USB cables lying around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DpHvVXfnKgvmLYZWiYYVDi" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-5.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DpHvVXfnKgvmLYZWiYYVDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I don&apos;t have any issues with the design itself, the build quality isn&apos;t quite on par with other power banks. The Major Ultra had one tumble in the month I used it, and the power button dislodged; it&apos;s titled to the side, and is unable to be activated. This isn&apos;t a big deal as the power button doesn&apos;t do much other than indicate remaining battery level, but it&apos;s still annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A9LWGB3yHVJRPUCDsBrM6h" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-3.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9LWGB3yHVJRPUCDsBrM6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Major Ultra comes with one USB-C port and two USB-A ports. The USB-C port is the one that goes up to 65W over the PD protocol, with the USB-A ports limited to 18W. Stuffcool obviously reused the same design as the Major Max, so it went with the same port configuration, but the brand should have offered two USB-C ports — all other 20000mAh power banks I tested in the last 15 months have at least two USB-C ports, and the Ultra is distinctly on the backfoot as a result.</p>

<p>The solitary USB-C port limits the versatility of the Major Ultra, but the power bank has a unique advantage in that it hits 65W over the USB PD PPS standard, making it a fantastic choice for use with Samsung devices. Yes, you get just a single USB-C port, but it delivers a reliable charge, and the ability to use it with Samsung devices is a big deal in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iDL5hamzhP6CN5yfBezvqi" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-6.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iDL5hamzhP6CN5yfBezvqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s also great is that the internal battery charges at 65W; it takes just over three hours to charge the 20000mAh battery, but it is much better than the Major Max. The Major Ultra uses standard USB PD 3.0 power profiles, and here&apos;s a quick rundown:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C in/out (65W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.21A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C PPS (65W Max):</strong> 3.3 - 13.5V/5A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A1/A2 out (18W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.25A (18W)</li><li><strong>Micro-USB in (18W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W)</li></ul>
<p>With two devices connected to the power bank, the USB-C port goes down to 45W, with either USB-A port limited to 15W, going up to a maximum of 65W. I used the Major Ultra over the course of a month to charge the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, and a host of other devices, and I didn&apos;t see any problems with charging. The dual USB-A ports are better suited to charge accessories, and that&apos;s what I ended up using most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xHZsEGB8f6hdRFsshAtZbj" name="stuffcool-major-ultra-7.jpg" alt="Stuffcool Major Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHZsEGB8f6hdRFsshAtZbj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Stuffcool also did a great job with the bundled cable this time around. It goes up to 100W and delivers 20V at 5A without breaking a sweat, and I was able to use it to charge notebooks and other devices with ease.</p><p>Overall, the Major Ultra is a decent upgrade over the Major Max, and it doesn&apos;t cost too much more. It continues to be one of the most affordable choices if you need a 20000mAh power bank with 65W PD charging, and the ability to maximize the charging potential of Samsung phones is an added bonus.</p>

<p>Apple and Google/Fitbit jumped onto the training load bandwagon in 2024, and it&apos;s long overdue. I credit my boosted VO2 Max directly to following my running watches&apos; training load guidance, especially Garmin&apos;s training load focus graph. But no brand does it perfectly, and I&apos;m more than happy to vent about their flaws.</p><p>Some leave their training load data too vague to understand. Some don&apos;t differentiate enough between different <em>types</em> of load. And some put too much weight on your heart rate average when deciding on load instead of your varied heart rates throughout a run.</p><p>I&apos;d love to combine training load elements from Garmin, Coros, Apple, and Fitbit into one ideal training tool that better reflects my <em>actual</em> training effort.</p>
<h2 id="the-training-load-tl-dr-2">The training load TL;DR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="azXfWv3jcyT4i4cGt7sgWo" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-and-Coros-Vertix-2X-training-load-ratio.jpeg" alt="Training load acute/chronic ratio on the Garmin Forerunner 965 and suggested training load on the Coros Vertix 2S." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/azXfWv3jcyT4i4cGt7sgWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For people who have no idea what I&apos;m talking about, training load is an arbitrary number calculated by your minutes of activity multiplied by your heart rate effort level. </p><p>A 30-minute zone-2 or 3 run might net you 60 points of training load (aka 30 x 2), while a steady two-hour walk might only give you 40 points (120 x 0.33). A 15-minute track workout might net you 150–200 points, depending on your effort.</p><p>Different brands calculate load with similar methods but their own multipliers and unique heart rate zones. I ran a 10K wearing four watches today and got training load scores of 130, 140, 160, and 220 despite near-identical HR and GPS data. As I said, the number is arbitrary. </p><p>Why does it matter, then? Because they compare your acute load — your added-up score across a week of workouts — against your chronic load — four weeks of workouts — and see how they compare. You always want your recent acute load to match or beat your long-term chronic load. It doesn&apos;t matter if your load total is 200 or 1,000, only whether it&apos;s a better number than it was last week or month, without being <em>so</em> much higher that you hurt yourself overtraining.</p>
<h2 id="what-garmin-gets-right-and-wrong-about-training-load-2">What Garmin gets right (and wrong) about training load</h2>
<p>Like other brands, Garmin tells you if your acute load is "optimal" to get fitter, with a training load ratio comparing your weekly total and monthly average. What I especially need, though, is "training load focus."</p><p>Under Training Status on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, I can find a graph that splits my four-week load into three categories: <strong>anaerobic</strong>, <strong>high aerobic</strong>, or <strong>low aerobic</strong> workouts. </p><p>Conventional running wisdom is that you can&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a> by running hard every time. You need "conversational pace" workouts in lower heart rate zones to improve base fitness (low aerobic), plus max-effort sprints where your body can&apos;t gain oxygen fast enough and burns muscular energy instead (anaerobic).</p><p>Garmin&apos;s graph yells at me every time I have a low aerobic or anaerobic "shortage," so I make a point of varying my training load types, whereas <em>other</em> brands might simply encourage you to gain as much load as possible. It&apos;s helped me improve my VO2 Max from 46 to 51 in the past year or so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="U3pXHuZNHzEGV3gxV4N2p5" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-and-Coros-Vertix-2X-training-load.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 and Coros Vertix 2S showing how much training load I earned across a 10K run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3pXHuZNHzEGV3gxV4N2p5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">All of Garmin's load went to high aerobic.

<p>My one (major) complaint with Garmin training load focus is that it puts <em>way</em> too much stock on heart rate <strong>average</strong>. If I run three miles in my zone 2 heart rate zone (HRZ), I usually get about 60 low-aerobic load. Today, I ran three miles in zone 2 and three miles in zones 3–4; in the end, <em>all</em> of that load went directly to high aerobic.</p><p>Every run "is analyzed from start to finish to determine the *primary* category into which it falls," the Garmin Forerunner team explained to me. They do "split the load within an activity into anaerobic and aerobic, but we will not further split it into high and low aerobic."</p><p>When I asked if they would "consider calculating and splitting up load focus based on mile splits or other criteria," I received the rather terse response, "We have considered it."</p><p>Their reply made me less than optimistic, but in an ideal world, Garmin <em>would</em> split up training load in smaller increments instead of focusing on the average. That way, I could jog for a few miles and then end with a high-aerobic mile for fun without worrying that it&apos;ll drag the average up enough to cancel out my earlier restraint.</p><p>I&apos;m also skeptical about how well Garmin&apos;s aerobic/anaerobic split works, for what it&apos;s worth. I ran a half marathon last month where I was mostly in zones 3/4 but consistently hit 90%+ my maximum heart rate for most of the last 30 minutes. I got <em>no</em> anaerobic training effect at the end, only high aerobic.</p>

<p>My ideal training load system would use the guts of the Garmin experience. I still love its training load focus and daily suggested workouts that adjust based on whether you need more anaerobic or low-aerobic load. I&apos;d just "borrow" some things from Coros, Apple, and Fitbit/Google.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:604px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.09%;"><img id="x4N9eTDV6zGdTsjyff23wW" name="coros-evolab-activity-training-load-breakdown.jpeg" alt="A weekly activity breakdown showing how much of a run was easy, medium, or hard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4N9eTDV6zGdTsjyff23wW.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="604" height="369" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>With my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS Pace 3</a> or Vertix 2X, I don&apos;t have to worry about averages. Each run splits the training load into three categories: easy, medium, and hard. So, when you look at the four-week intensity distribution graph, you know it&apos;s accurate. You also get more specifics with the monthly Pace Zone Distribution graph, which splits exact load totals across each heart rate zone.</p><p>What holds me back from using COROS more often is the lack of guidance. I like how Garmin marks the "optimal" easy/hard training load I should have and adjusts workout suggestions accordingly, whereas COROS lets independent runners figure that out for themselves. I&apos;ll admit I need the extra help.</p>

<p>I can&apos;t talk specifics about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a>, the brand-new system being added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> and other Fitbits, until I can review the watch. Talking <em>exclusively</em> about what Google revealed publicly at its Made by Google event, I <strong>love</strong> that Fitbit calculates load based on both "logged workouts" and "general activity."</p><p>Every other fitness watch brand only tracks training load if you&apos;re "training." But Fitbit doesn&apos;t distinguish; you can get training load any time your heart rate elevates above the norm, regardless of the activity. Some people might prefer having more control over training load, but others will like being validated for sweaty everyday tasks or walking their dog for 10 minutes. Little things add up.</p><p>As for Apple, I haven&apos;t had a chance to test its new 7- and 28-day training load graphs yet; they look promising and accessible for casual athletes, if a bit short on the numbers Garmin and Coros offer.</p><p>What I do like about Apple is how you can manually change your training load impact by rating the workout intensity from 1–10. I&apos;ve been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-phone-isnt-built-to-handle-hiking-and-im-sick-of-it">doing more hiking</a> recently, and Garmin tends to lowball my training load for hikes because my heart rate is fairly steady, even if my muscles are getting sore from the hills and valleys. I wouldn&apos;t mind being able to bump up (or down) my load numbers when I feel like the auto-generated number isn&apos;t perfect.</p>
<hr>
<p>No <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> gets things perfect with training load. Each has its strengths and disadvantages. And frankly, I&apos;d rather have an imperfect training load tool than no load at all! The fact that more brands are implementing it means that we&apos;ll see more innovation across the board as they, <em>ahem</em>, "borrow" from one another.</p><p>For now, I&apos;m going to keep using Garmin, but I&apos;ll have to keep using my workaround: End a run when I&apos;m done with one workout type, and then immediately start another run at high aerobic or anaerobic. Maybe one day, Garmin will let me relax on monitoring my HR average so closely.</p>

Samsung is one of the best brands in this category, and its T5 Evo SSD is a great choice if you need plenty of storage on the go. The 4TB T5 Evo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDJXZ19/">down to just $199 on Amazon</a>, and that&apos;s a fantastic deal — the drive usually sells for over $300.</p><p>Now, the T5 Evo isn&apos;t the fastest SSD around, but with reads/writes of 460MB/s, it is magnitudes better than a regular HDD. The best reason to pick up the drive is the value; you&apos;re just shelling out $50/TB, and that&apos;s a downright bargain. If you need a faster SSD to use with your notebook, Samsung&apos;s T7 Shield is my recommendation, and right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE2T0R-AM/dp/B09VLJ7VBM/">2TB model is just $149 on Amazon</a>.</p><p>Want an SSD that&apos;s masquerading as a regular USB drive?

<p>The Tube T31 is a good choice if you want an external SSD to connect to a gaming console in addition to your notebook. It transfers data at 1,000MB/s , and the rugged design ensures long-term durability. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b9255a2c-a9c4-4b0f-9341-a2c5a9a1bbf0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>You can&apos;t go wrong with any of these SSDs, and if you just want plenty of affordable storage, the T5 Evo is the go-to choice. It connects over the USB 3.2 Gen 1 standard, and while it excels at storage, it maxes out at 460MB/s, and that&apos;s less than half of what you get with most other external SSDs. It&apos;s still four times higher than mechanical drives, and the smaller size combined with 4TB of storage and rugged design makes it a strong contender — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDJXZ19">particularly at just $199</a>.</p><p>If you need blazing-fast transfers, you should just get the Samsung T7 Shield. The best-selling SSD uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2 protocol, and with transfers of 1,050MB/s, it is among the best in this category. You get a durable design with IP65 ingress protection, and you can connect the drive to your phone and transfer photos and any other data you want to back up with ease. Obviously, you don&apos;t get as good a value as the T5 Evo, but the 2TB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-Photographers-MU-PE2T0R-AM/dp/B09VLJ7VBM">still a great choice at $149</a>.</p><p>Lastly, the Tube T31 gets my vote because of the design and what it brings to the table. The SSD looks like a regular USB drive, but you still get transfers of up to 1,000MB/s, and it is also based on the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard. It&apos;s the obvious choice if you want to use an external SSD with a gaming console alongside your notebook, but as there&apos;s just a USB-A port, there isn&apos;t a way to connect it to your phone. If your use case revolves around gaming and notebook use, the Tube T31 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-1000MB-External-Compatible/dp/B0CQZCWHTQ">standout choice at $79</a>.</p>
