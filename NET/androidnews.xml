                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Quest v64 update began rolling out on Monday, April 8.</li><li>Meta promises that Quest 3 passthrough will have "higher resolution" with better "color, exposure, contrast, and dynamic range."</li><li>Other Quest 3 improvements include external mic support, a lying-down mode, and an improvement to casting.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of the main Quest 3 perks over other headsets is its full-color passthrough. While we liked how it worked out of the box, we&apos;ve noticed an immediate improvement since updating our headsets to the Quest v64 update — and we&apos;ll show you footage.</p><p>Announced on Monday, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v64-update-passthrough-improvements-external-microphones/" target="_blank">Quest v64 update</a> was designed to "improve the perceived resolution for passthrough by optimizing the passthrough pipeline," according to Meta. In practice, it&apos;s meant to make it easier to read "phone notifications and other small text," so you can check your messages without removing the headset. </p><p>At the same time, the Quest v64 update changed the "camera processing pipeline" to "improve color, exposure, contrast and dynamic range in passthrough." Meta says this makes color fidelity closer to real life and reduces "graininess in lower light conditions."</p><p>My colleague and fellow VR nerd Nick Sutrich donned his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> and recorded passthrough footage after downloading the update, which you can see in the embedded video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lLuM3CWn4Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Overall, the quality looks great, and it&apos;s easier to see text on phone or TV screens than before. That said, we did notice some obvious object warping when it moves. Your hand doesn&apos;t warp as you move it, but the room around the edges of your hand does warp slightly. </p><p>Since the Quest v64 notes don&apos;t mention this, we assume this is something you&apos;ll have to get used to! With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro</a> competing for VR fans&apos; love, this update is clearly designed to make the cheaper headset closer to the high-res Vision Pro in passthrough quality.</p><p>Beyond passthrough, the update supports external mics connected via the USB-C port if you enable it in Experimental Settings. Unlike other accessories like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-keyboard-and-mouse-oculus-quest-2">keyboards or mice</a>, you won&apos;t be able to connect one over Bluetooth. This change came after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-patches-quest-3-mic-issues-after-3-months">Meta fixed Quest 3&apos;s internal mic issues</a> in a previous update. </p>

<p>While the Quest v63 update added support for playing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a> while lying down, the Quest 3 was left behind. Now, with v64, Quest 3 owners can enable "Use Apps While Lying Down" in Experimental Settings, then lie down and hold the Oculus button to change their perspective. </p><p>We recommend looking into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5655932521164368/" target="_blank">Pillow</a>, a Quest app designed before Meta&apos;s lying-down update with cute experiences like stargazing, meditation, and bedtime stories. Ironically, the developer Lucas Rizzotto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/_LucasRizzotto/status/1773559728951730426" target="_blank">complained on Twitter/X</a> that the v63 update broke his app, but he appears to have fixed it prior to v64.</p><p>The last major feature update ensures that if you remove your Meta Quest headset while casting to a TV, the headset will "keep the stream alive" instead of going black. Now you can take a break or pass the headset to someone else without having to reset the casting settings — especially useful for those unfamiliar with VR!</p><p>Considering Meta temporarily removed casting from Quest before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/chromecasting-is-officially-back-on-meta-quest">bringing casting back this January</a>, it&apos;s nice to see that Meta is continuing to improve the feature, rather than letting it languish.</p>

<ul><li>Poetic sent us four alleged Google Pixel 8a cases, including rugged and non-rugged case models.</li><li>The case shape matches up with leaks, showing a slightly smaller phone with rounded corners.</li><li>One case includes a MagSafe ring on the back, meaning Google likely hasn't adopted Qi2 wireless charging with its new phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve seen the leaks for months, and now we&apos;ve got our hands on what could be the first batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> cases from Poetic. These cases give us a proper idea of what the Pixel 8a should look like if Google unveils the new budget-priced phone at Google I/O 2024 next month, as we anticipate.</p><p>While the two rugged case models are great for folks who need extra protection, I&apos;m particularly interested in what the other two case models reveal. The Poetic Neon Pixel 8a case showcases substantially rounder edges than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> has. As I noted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro review</a>, rounded corners make phones much nicer to hold one-handed.</p>

<p>If the Pixel 8a has rounder corners, it would make the phone feel slightly smaller. Indeed, the Poetic Neon case suggests that the Pixel 8a could be ever-so-slightly smaller than the Pixel 7a, as I&apos;m not able to fit a Pixel 7a into Poetic&apos;s Pixel 8a case.</p><p>Poetic&apos;s case designs seem to match up nicely with several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8a-spotted-in-google-fi-advertisement">Pixel 8a design leaks</a>. Many times, case manufacturers can get ahold of "dummy" phone models before a phone&apos;s release, allowing them to design cases based on early designs. As such, there&apos;s always a likelihood that the final phone design could differ from what&apos;s on offer here.</p><p>Either way, we hope Google doesn&apos;t ditch the camera bar design on this phone as it looks like they might on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-to-opt-for-8-dot-2-inch-foldable-screen">Pixel Fold 2</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the inclusion of a MagSafe ring on the Poetic Guardian MagSafe Pixel 8a case tells me that the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2 wireless charging standard</a> is still not ready for prime time. Or, at the least, Google may not be willing to fork over any extra R&D for a budget-minded phone.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about Poetic&apos;s Pixel 8a cases, but the company did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p><p>The Pixel 8a is rumored to retail for around $500 but is rumored to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-higher-price">a bit of a price hike</a> over the Pixel 7a. Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-pixel-7a-deals">best Pixel 7a deals</a> will get you that phone for hundreds less than the rumored Pixel 8a price.</p>

<p>Sign up for Straight Talk Wireless' Silver Unlimited plan ($45/month) before April 14th and the Verizon-owned MVNO carrier will hook you up with a Galaxy A15 5G for only 99 bucks. The A15 was already pretty cheap, but if you were planning to make a change to your wireless service anyway, this deal takes affordability to a whole new level. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15</a> just hit the market last December, so I was pretty surprised to see this offer come down the pipeline so soon. Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">MVNO deals</a>, the eligibility requirements here aren&apos;t too difficult to achieve, either. The Silver Unlimited plan starts at just $45/month per line and you get unlimited talk, text, and data provided by Verizon, along with 10GB of hotspot data and unlimited talk and text in Mexico and Canada. All of those perks AND a slick Samsung device? Sign me up.</p><p>Sure, the Galaxy A15 5G may not be the most impressive Android phone that you&apos;ll ever use, but when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">phones under $200</a>, it&apos;s an absolute game-changer. You get a vibrant 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate straight out of the box, plus fast 25W charging, surprisingly-decent cameras, and four years of OS updates guaranteed. There&apos;s also a microSD slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack, two specs you won&apos;t see in many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> nowadays. </p><p>This Straight Talk Wireless deal may not be for everyone, but if you want cheap wireless service bundled with a cheap device, it doesn&apos;t get much better than this. </p>

<ul><li>Google has announced the debut of "Gemini in Android Studio," which removes the old "Studio Bot" in favor of more AI.</li><li>Through Android Studio Jellyfish (preview version), users can text with Gemini, asking it for tips on coding and more.</li><li>Google has included a Generative AI start-up template based on Gemini's API so users can quickly add AI-powered app features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is moving ahead with its "next chapter" of the Gemini era by introducing the AI&apos;s Pro model in Android Studio.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, Android Studio supports Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Gemini 1.0 Pro model</a>. Gemini has taken over the old "Studio Bot" that developers found during the platform&apos;s introduction in 2023. The company states that AI should help app developers create their products "faster" and "easier." Those developing apps through Android Studio will find a host of features, beginning with "Ask Gemini."</p><p>Google states Gemini can understand "natural language" from users&apos; text queries. A chat window will be available to developers so they can type their questions to Gemini. The company adds that you can ask questions such as "how do I add camera support to my app?" and "What&apos;s the best way to get location on Android?"</p><p>The article states that Gemini will remember what users have asked, opening up the possibility of asking follow-up questions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:533px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.57%;"><img id="JBddEx37cmMPuj5uVYCxkD" name="google-gemini-in-android-studio-text-prompts.jpg" alt="Google Gemini in Android Studio lets developers ask the AI questions for coding assistance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JBddEx37cmMPuj5uVYCxkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="533" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI-powered code "completions" is another feature Gemini brings to the table. The AI is said to offer ideas on how developers can complete "multi-line" pieces of code. Additionally, users should also discover suggestions for code comments and ways to add documentation to their strings of code.</p><p>Gemini in Android Studio comes packed with its own "Generative AI app" starter template. This template is based on the Gemini model&apos;s API so users can quickly plug AI-powered features into their apps. The API supports image and text inputs alongside summarization, translation, and more capabilities.</p><p>Google states those interested can find this API template in the Canary release channel for Android Studio. Head over to <strong>File > New Project > Gemini API Starter </strong>to get going.</p>

<p>Privacy is a talking point with AI, and Google states Gemini in Android Studio was designed to keep your code between you and the bot during that session. It states that "by default," Gemini&apos;s responses are based on your conversation history with it. Users are given the choice of whether or not they&apos;d like to submit additional information for "customized responses."</p><p>Moreover, Gemini in Android Studio is only available after developers log into their accounts and enable it. Google reiterates that it will continue to stick with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">AI Principles</a> to ensure user safety with its software.</p><p>Gemini is available beginning today (Apr. 8) in its Android Studio Jellyfish preview version in over 180 countries. Google reiterates that developers can utilize these tools at no cost, however, that will change at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Sony debuted the halo-style headstrap design with the original PSVR, and while it made slipping the headset on and off quite easy, the ergonomics didn&apos;t work for everyone. Over the years, companies like BoboVR have tweaked the design for the better, modifying the angle of the straps, adding an extra hinge for enhanced comfort, and keeping the headset from sagging with a brilliant top "strap" design.</p><p>The BoboVR M3 Pro uses a dual hinge design to ensure the perfect fit no matter your head shape or size. The side straps adjust via a convenient wheel on the back — an industry-standard design most headstraps use — and you can adjust the angle of the headset easily by tilting the Meta Quest 3 up or down thanks to the mid-hinge.</p><p>The headstrap slides onto the side rails of the Quest 3 instead of clipping on, a design that I far prefer because it feels safer to remove when you need to. Plus, you can easily slide it further in or out to accommodate different head sizes.</p><p>The back is padded in comfy, PU leather pads that are removable via Velcro connections and easily cleaned. BoboVR even includes a pack of hexagonal grippy pads that help keep the headset steady for folks with longer hair.</p>

<p>As you&apos;d expect from a halo-style strap, most of the Quest 3&apos;s front-heavy weight is evenly distributed between the back of your head and your forehead. BoboVR improved upon this design by adding two clever pads for the top of your head which adds both a new weight distribution point, plus keeps the headset from sagging if you don&apos;t have it on super tight.</p><p>Some other slight design tweaks — plus design changes between the Meta Quest 2 and 3 — also keep it from wobbling like the BoboVR M2 Pro did. In fact, the wobble is the main reason I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/geekvr-q2-pro-review">GeekVR Q2 Pro</a> on my Quest 2 over the BoboVR M2 Pro.</p><p>There&apos;s still a slight headset wobble if you quickly flick your head but I can&apos;t think of an actual scenario where this happened to me outside of testing <em>for</em> wobble. You&apos;ll find that there&apos;s even less wobble when pairing it with something like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/amvr-quest-3-facial-interface-review">AMVR Quest 3 face pad</a>, as well.</p>

<p>If you happen to be like me and love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a>&apos;s open visor configuration — that means not using a face pad at all — the BoboVR M3 Pro is a pretty excellent way to work while wearing a Quest 3.</p><p>It&apos;s mildly awkward to use it like this and you&apos;ll need to adjust it to find the sweet spot. Plus, unlike the Quest Pro, you really shouldn&apos;t move around much unless you enjoy constantly resetting the headset position to get back to the lens sweet spot.</p><p>That&apos;s not the headstrap&apos;s fault — we&apos;d ideally need a face pad that has an open bottom and sides for proper weight distribution — but it&apos;s still possible to use the Quest 3 without a face pad with this headstrap in some circumstances.</p><p>Even with a facepad, though, the BoboVR M3 Pro doesn&apos;t reduce the FoV like the M2 Pro did. Some of that has to do with better lenses on the Quest 3 but the other part is that it&apos;s easy to adjust how close it is to your face thanks to BoboVR&apos;s dual hinge design.</p>

<p>Lastly, BoboVR&apos;s brilliant magnetic battery packs are easily swapped out and rechargeable via a USB-C connection. They emit an audible beep when successfully attached, so you don&apos;t have to wonder if the headset made a successful connection.</p><p>The batteries have four LEDs on the front that light up to show the battery percentage in 25% increments. Tapping the single button on the battery will light these up and let you know how much is left at a glance.</p><p>You can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-Charger-Station-Ultra-Thin-Magnetically/dp/B0B1W9B4PN/">second battery plus a charger</a> for $39.99, and each battery adds about two extra hours of battery life to the Quest 3. The packs take around an hour and a half to fully charge, which means you can hot-swap packs to your heart&apos;s content as you play, especially when you use BoboVR&apos;s charger.</p><p>Plus, if you already own another BoboVR headstrap, those batteries are interchangeable with this headstrap.</p><p>BoboVR might have other headstrap options — both cheaper and more expensive — but the BoboVR M3 Pro is the best overall solution from the company. It won&apos;t cost you an arm and a leg and the advantages over the company&apos;s cheaper headstrap are worth the price.</p>

And that means sometimes conducting meetings virtually over Zoom or another video conferencing service. Even though we might not be ready to head to the office, we still want to look our best. Part of that includes having the right camera angle and business-appropriate attire (from the waist up, at least!) and having a favorable background and good lighting.</p><p>The best ring light for laptops is not a ring at all but rather shaped like a rectangle. The Lume Cube Broadcast Lighting Kit offers adjustable brightness and soft lighting. It can run from its extended built-in battery or via USB, making it ideal for working from home and on the go, and you even get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">tripod</a> included in the box.

<p>The shift towards the work-from-home paradigm post-pandemic means that we all participate in video calls a lot more than we ever did. So many people worry about having a suitable background when making video calls from their laptops or shooting videos but forget about another important factor: lighting.</p><p>When it comes to lighting, there are lots of ways you can make it better, including webcam lighting. However, one category, in particular, is ring lights, and it&apos;s totally worth investing in.</p><p>The best ring lights are a simple way to enhance the lighting, so your face looks natural and soft without harsh lights or darkened tones. And while the best ring light chosen in this guide isn&apos;t technically shaped like a ring, it functions in the same way as the others. It offers some really great features that put it a cut above the rest, including adjustable brightness from 1% up to 100%. You can also adjust the color temperature from warm orange to cool white and use the built-in frosted lens and white diffuser to create further soft and professional-looking light flattering to the face.</p><p>Shipping with a computer mount, the Lume Cube Broadcast Lighting Kit has a suction cup on the end to easily affix to any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">laptop</a> and a desktop computer or virtually any flat surface. Lume also includes a standing mount and a light diffuser if you want a soft glow. The built-in extended lithium-polymer battery lasts for up to 14 hours, but you can also plug it in via USB to use external power if the battery is running low.</p><p>Sure, it&apos;s more expensive than some of the others. But if you are doing a lot of video calls and meetings, vlogging, or other activities that require great lighting with your laptop, it&apos;s a no-brainer investment. If you&apos;re on a budget, though, or have less frequent lighting needs, any of the other options are worth considering.</p><p>Once you&apos;ve grabbed the best ring light for your home office needs, be sure to pick up a few handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">tips and tricks for Google Meet</a>. Decent hardware isn&apos;t always enough to get the best video conferencing experience; software is important too.</p>

Unfortunately, I&apos;ve never seen a total eclipse, and I had to miss out on this one, too, but plenty of other people got to see one today as one passed through parts of the United States. One friend wasn&apos;t lucky enough to see the total eclipse since he lives in California, but he still took some pretty cool photos with his Pixel, while one Android Central writer also managed to get a cool image with his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>With my friend being in California, he could only capture the eclipse from an angle, with most of the sun still present. However, you can clearly see the moon peaking through the corner, covering about one-quarter of the sun. And despite capturing a partial view of the eclipse, I&apos;m still quite impressed with how the photos came out from his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>According to my friend, he used the Pixel 7 Pro and captured the images at 5x optical and then at 30x. To protect his lens, he took the photos through the lens of some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses">cheap eclipse glasses</a>, similar to the pair we recommended, and a 100mm photographic filter.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Nick Sutrich, who is closer to the path of totality, also got a pretty great photo of the eclipse from his Pixel 8 Pro. The image below was taken at 30xzoom, similar to my friend&apos;s Pixel 7 Pro, and you can see the moon covering most of the sun except for a sliver on the side. That said, there was a bit of cloud coverage where he&apos;s at, which obstructed the image a bit, but the result is spectacular nonetheless.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, cloud coverage was a problem for many Android Central staff. That includes myself, although I wouldn&apos;t have been able to see much from Seattle, WA, anyway.</p><p>I did manage to get a pretty <em>okay</em> photo of the 2023 annular solar eclipse, which I took using my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra at full zoom. It&apos;s extremely grainy, and clouds were trying to ruin the experience, but I&apos;m still happy with the result, as it&apos;s the closest I&apos;ve gotten to witnessing a total eclipse.</p>

<p>As Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand points out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/taking-eclipse-photos-with-phone">taking a photo of an eclipse can be easy</a>, so long as the timing and weather are right (darn clouds) and you have the right equipment, like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-tripod">phone tripod</a>. Hopefully, some of you were able to take some pretty cool images of the eclipse with your smartphones and use the appropriate gear to protect your lenses.</p>

<hr>
<p>Shortly after Nothing confirmed two earbud products this year, a newly surfaced leak suggests pricing and other specifications.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-nothing-ear-leak">Android Headlines</a>, the Nothing Ear is poised to be the "higher-end" device of the two devices launching later in April. Design-wise, the buds don&apos;t divert much from the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a>, which launched last year. Leaked imaging suggests users will see the same transparent design on the earbuds with the stabilizer stem to help keep it in your ear.</p><p>The leak adds that the upcoming "Ear" buds will feature ANC (active noise cancellation), dual connection, and an IP54 waterproof rating.</p>

<p>The case appears largely the same, as well, from the supposed product photos. It appears that Nothing has fully colored the inside of the case instead of featuring spots of transparency like its predecessor. Moreover, the leak suggests the company has dropped the "Ear case" from the side of it.</p><p>The publication purports the case will say "Nothing," indicative of more branding changes for its audio devices. Listening time will supposedly land users at around 7.5 hours with ANC off, backed by 33 hours, courtesy of the case.</p><p>Nothing will allegedly price the Ear at €150. Estimations put the device debuting at around $162 in the U.S., but this price will likely change as Nothing works out the figures. The device may hit the market sporting two colorways: white and black.</p>

<p>The Nothing "Ear a" is the second product launch the company confirmed last Friday (Apr. 5). The design of the (assumedly) cheaper buds mirrors its higher-end sibling alongside its rumored features. However, there is a difference with the charging case. The alleged photos suggest the "Ear a" case will be much smaller as the company looks toward a rectangular aesthetic.</p><p>The buds are seemingly placed much closer together inside the case, as well.</p><p>The publication states that there&apos;s a slight difference in battery life as the "Ear a" buds will supposedly climb to 8 hours of listening time. Rumors add that the charging case will provide 38 hours of additional energy.</p><p>The "Ear a" is rumored to pick up the same white and black colorways as its sibling, as well as a yellow hue. Speculation states this yellow colorway is part of an "eco-friendly" design approach by Nothing.</p><p>The "a" moniker of the second Ear product suggests it will reside on the cheaper side of Nothing&apos;s products, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>. With that, rumors speculate the device could launch at or below €100, which is roughly $108.</p><p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-ear-a-confirmation">confirmed the upcoming launch</a> of the newly announced "Ear" and "Ear a" last week. The company stated devices are the "ultimate iteration of Nothing audio" as they push ahead for what&apos;s next. Nothing has notably dropped the number from its product name, signaling its new focus on what it&apos;s delivering and the user experience.</p><p>Consumers should expect Nothing to reveal both new devices on April 18.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung vastly improved the photo editing features of Galaxy phones with the combined release of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> and One UI 6.1. Many of these tools are software-based and bundled with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, a suite of features available on recent Samsung Galaxy flagships that uses generative artificial intelligence, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>. However, Samsung is also working on photo editing features that don&apos;t require AI. One such feature is borrowed from Photoshop, and it&apos;s the Magnetic Lasso. </p><p>With version <strong>3.4.21.41</strong> of the Samsung Photo Editor app, the company is adding Magnetic Lasso to the Object Eraser tool (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-photo-editor-object-eraser-gets-magnetic-lasso/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). For those who haven&apos;t used the feature in Photoshop, it makes selecting the area of an image you want to erase easier. Previously, you could have the Samsung Photo Editor app try to detect the subject automatically. After tapping the portion of the image that contains the object you want to erase, the app could create a rough outline of the area that should be erased. Another option is to manually draw an outline of the subject.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever used an automatic object selection tool, you probably know these are far from perfect. They often either select too much of an object or leave things out. When trying to erase an unwanted part of an image, this isn&apos;t acceptable. Manually selecting an object with an Object Eraser isn&apos;t ideal, either. Your finger isn&apos;t a precise enough pointing device to do so accurately, so getting a good result is unlikely. </p><p>Magnetic Lasso is a hybrid option that lets you draw a "lasso" around your subject. When you release your finger, the lasso will snap to the subject&apos;s outline. This gives the Object Eraser a good idea of exactly where to look for the subject, making a good selection much more likely than simply tapping the subject. Magnetic Lasso, already a popular Photoshop feature, instantly makes the Samsung Photo Editor app more robust for photo editing. </p><p>Magnetic Lasso is enabled by default after updating to the latest version of the Samsung Photo Editor app. After opening an image in the gallery, you can tap <strong>Edit </strong>> <strong>Tools</strong> > <strong>Object Eraser</strong> to find the Magnetic Lasso. Since it&apos;s turned on by default, it&apos;ll be the primary way to select objects when using Object Eraser. However, if you want to turn it off, you can tap it in the top right corner of the screen.</p><p>Samsung hasn&apos;t started a full rollout of the Samsung Photo Editor app update that includes the Magnetic Lasso. If you don&apos;t see an update, you can check back in a few days. </p>

<p>Hi Loujain. I&apos;m sorry your mother has passed, and I hope your family is doing well and supporting each other. Times like this can be tough and emotionally draining. If you need another online ear to talk to, I&apos;m here.</p><p>I&apos;m both glad and sad that you asked this question, which I&apos;ve received several times. It&apos;s to be expected as death is part of life, as cliche and macabre as that sounds.</p><p>Before we go any further, we all should take a few moments to prepare so we don&apos;t leave our family members in the same situation. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-prepare-your-google-account-when-you-pass-away">I&apos;ve written a few simple things</a> we should do to prepare our own account data to make it easier for our family.</p>
<p>The short answer is that Google can not help you and your family unlock your late mother&apos;s phone. Even if the company wanted to do it (it doesn&apos;t), Google can&apos;t help you unlock any phone because it doesn&apos;t have access to the password, fingerprint, or any other way to unlock the phone&apos;s screen.</p><p>Unfortunately, that probably means all the data on the phone is lost forever. It&apos;s encrypted and locked away  — the only thing you can do is contact Google and request the account data.</p><p>It may not seem that way now, but this is good. We want the devices that manage our lives to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">safe and secure</a> and should expect companies like Google to try and make them this way.</p>
<p>This hits very close to home because I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prepare-your-digital-information-for-the-inevitable">recently went through the same thing</a>. My father passed away, and I was forced to contact Apple because his phone was locked. The process isn&apos;t the same between Apple and Google, but it&apos;s close. If your mother accessed her Google account in the past two years, Google can help you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2NeU87fJ4kXtp4gUTrocgj" name="OnePlus-Nord-N20-fingerprint-sensor-face-unlock.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord N20 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NeU87fJ4kXtp4gUTrocgj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;re going to need the death certificate at a minimum. Apple required the death certificate and a court order noting I was the inheritor of my late father&apos;s data. I got the latter through a clerk at my local courthouse.</p>
<p>Google states, "In certain circumstances we may provide content from a deceased user&apos;s account. In all of these cases, our primary responsibility is to keep people&apos;s information secure, safe, and private. We cannot provide passwords or other login details. Any decision to satisfy a request about a deceased user will be made only after a careful review."</p><p>According to someone who went through this process, Google provided an archive of photos, Drive documents, Calendar entries, and contacts. The company was not able to provide email messages, text or chat messages, or YouTube user data. In addition, Google helped remove the activation lock so the phone could be factory reset.</p>
<p>This may be helpful, even if it doesn&apos;t provide exactly what you need. You can get the process started by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/6357590">visiting this link</a>.</p>
