<p>This week, Polar released a 22mm "Payment Wristband" with an NFC chip embedded into the strap, enabling tap-to-pay if your watch doesn&apos;t support it. We haven&apos;t seen tech-filled watch bands since the early days of Pebble and Galaxy Gear, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/media-room/polar-introduces-payment-wristbands-powered-by-fidesmo">Polar&apos;s modular tech</a> has me curious if this abandoned idea deserves a renaissance.</p><p>Smart straps died for several reasons. Put tech in a strap, and it naturally loses its flexibility, is more prone to failure, requires a power source, and is generally less comfortable. It also prevents users from swapping in their own straps since it means losing functionality.</p><p>Instead, with massive watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> on the rise, designers use lightweight bands as crutches to offset the extra weight. A thick, tech-filled band would be counterproductive. </p><p>With that context, it&apos;s hard to imagine why anyone would want "smart straps" to return. Still, handled correctly, smartwatch bands have untapped potential, and some companies have begun to explore that potential.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-ill-fated-history-of-apos-smart-apos-watch-bands-2">A brief, ill-fated history of &apos;smart&apos; watch bands</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7tiAXF6CZj9TkpcHsVxfsb" name="gear16_0.jpg" alt="A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Gear (2013)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tiAXF6CZj9TkpcHsVxfsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The original Galaxy Gear, with its visible camera bump. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The original Samsung Galaxy Gear packed a 720p camera with autofocus, two mics, and a speaker into its band. Samsung&apos;s engineers saw that extra band space as an opportunity to keep the main watch more compact, instead of cramming everything into one space. </p><p>Our original reviewer called the 73g Gear "bulky and uncomfortable" and the strap&apos;s camera sensor a "wart." Samsung&apos;s engineers agreed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-2-gear-2-neo-and-gear-fit-review">Gear 2</a> moved the camera and mic/speaker tech onto the watch, and future iterations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-s2-review">Gear S2</a> had a much greater focus on style and comfort. From then on, you could swap any band onto a Gear or Galaxy watch without losing essential tech. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Companies have tried to put smart watch bands on watches before, but they never took off.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In that same early era, Pebble launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">Pebble Time</a>, its 2nd-gen watch, on Kickstarter with a unique "Smartstraps" gimmick. It featured a "smart accessory port" so third-party strap makers could pack tech and sensors into their straps that would sync directly with the watch. </p><p>Pebble offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-announces-million-dollar-fund-bring-smartstrap-ideas-life">$1 million in funding</a> for Smartstrap devs, promising users add-ons like GPS, heart rate, or extended battery life. There was even an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/parag-smart-band-could-add-nfc-payments-pebble-time">NFC payment strap from Pagaré</a>. However, once Fitbit acquired the failing Pebble brand the following year, the concept died before it could truly begin. </p><p>These "optional" health and fitness add-ons became default features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> over time. Watch designers have become so efficient at squeezing useful components into a 13mm case that pushing tech into a thick band would unnecessarily complicate matters.</p>

<p>Sony took a different approach, selling standalone smart straps that you attach to non-smart luxury watches. Its 2015 Wena Wrist Pro tracked your steps, calories, and sleep. It even had a bizarre sliver of an OLED screen that displayed tiny contextual data along your wrist. However, its excessive price and limited features made it a novelty that never caught on.</p><p>It also sold a standalone fitness tracker with built-in GPS and HR data called the Wena Wrist Active. I mention it because Sony designed it with a unique connector that lets you mount any watch onto its front, adding classic style while keeping the health data.</p><p>Besides the 2013 Hands On Talk Watch, which had a mic and speaker embedded in the strap (thanks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>), I don&apos;t know of any other smartwatches with smart bands. The concept seemed to die off quickly, as most brands emulated Apple or Galaxy Watches in design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.03%;"><img id="aVQf63s2jy5LnHHjeeCQ6T" name="fitbit-pressure-sensoring-patent-figure-7.jpeg" alt="A Figure from the patent "Pressure sensor integration into wearable device" showing how a watch would tell you to adjust your fit for a proper Fit Score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aVQf63s2jy5LnHHjeeCQ6T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2251" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: U.S. patent office; Fitbit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar&apos;s €59 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/payment-wristband-22mm" target="_blank">Payment Wristband</a> has one straightforward application: It is designed to make consumers pay for NFC themselves rather than add the tech to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> or other watches. It&apos;s a niche tool, unlikely to achieve high sales, but still quite useful.</p><p>Are there other smartwatch "extras" that could fit inside a 20mm or 22mm watch band? It&apos;s complicated. </p><p>Ultramarathoners would love the original Pebble concept of a battery-enhancing, swap-on strap. Here&apos;s the problem: You&apos;d need an energy-receiving port in the strap connector — probably not Quick Release-compatible — and engineers would need to keep the band light and flexible despite how thick batteries typically are. Plus, encasing batteries in TPU material leaves them vulnerable to damage and failure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3758px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AdKE64rH87DYDk8MnLxMyi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-spigen-modern-fit-band-8.jpg" alt="Adjusting the Spigen Modern Fit watch band for the Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AdKE64rH87DYDk8MnLxMyi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3758" height="2114" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t have a design or engineering background, but an add-on strap with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">Ultra Wideband</a> seems more feasible. UWB lets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> owners pinpoint their lost Apple Watch or use their watch as a digital car key; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-plans-to-give-watch-unlock-a-boost-with-ultra-wideband-tech">next Pixel Watch could add UWB </a>as well. But an UWB strap, like an NFC strap, could theoretically work as a standalone add-on for any watch.</p><p>Straying freely into wish-fulfillment territory, I suspect most Garmin watch fans would love a strap that added LTE compatibility. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>, they&apos;ve waited in vain for more cellular options that would make Garmin watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-smartwatches-have-emergency-sos-fall-detection">more useful in emergencies</a>. </p><p>Like a battery strap, though, an LTE strap would be difficult to implement. Despite how small a 5G chip is, a standalone receiver with the necessary power source would be the <em>opposite</em> of portable. You&apos;d need a physical connection through the strap to the main CPU, and I just don&apos;t know if that would work. </p><p>For any other potential watch add-on, the engineering challenge alone makes it more likely that smartwatch brands would simply...put the tech in the watch. For example, you might assume a band could track an athlete&apos;s sweat loss, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-patented-perspiration-sensor-for-tracking-sweat-loss">this Apple patent</a> shows how a watch would track that data directly from the main body.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-smart-straps-2">The future of smart straps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C9VrwWdXjHQvjTsjNVz8rB" name="meta-neural-wearable-example.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Meta Connect 2022 showing Meta's neural interface wristband concept, specifically how it registers brainwaves based on minute finger and hand gestures." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9VrwWdXjHQvjTsjNVz8rB.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Currently, the only practical application I know of for a dynamic watch strap is found on portable blood pressure watches. Several models have <em>inflatable</em> straps that expand during BP readings for more accurate results, in theory. I couldn&apos;t tell you if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>&apos;s BP readings are more or less accurate with a normal watch band.</p><p>The next frontier is all about neural interface bands. Think of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">Double Tap feature</a> made popular with the Apple Watch, only with much better accuracy because these bands can read the signals from your brain, knowing that you intend to make a pinching motion even if your fingers barely move. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mudra-band.com/" target="_blank">Mudra Band</a>, released this year, replaces your typical watch strap and becomes a neural controller for any Apple computer, TV, Vision Pro, or other devices. Tech nerds could get a lot out of this, though it costs nearly as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series 9</a> itself. </p><p>Meanwhile, Meta is making its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-says-neural-interface-controls-are-close-to-ready">own neural EMG band</a>, promising mid-air typing to chat with an AI. CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims the "neural interface continuously gets better over time at understanding each person" and says it&apos;ll be product-ready in a couple of years. I&apos;d have to assume it&apos;ll be pricey, as well. </p><p>Perhaps that&apos;s the future of smartwatch strap tech that we should expect: expensive, niche, a bit gimmicky, and with cool implications. More straightforward smart straps with feature additions or battery enhancements sound pretty neat in theory, but a bit too impractical and costly to the consumer for companies to invest in the idea. </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need something you can trust to stay alive for days on end outside, with solar charging that can offer a potentially unlimited battery life; you want a smartwatch with extreme GPS accuracy, suitable for outdoor activities like backpacking, hiking, camping, and more; having a built-in LED flashlight is a major selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a slim, lightweight smartwatch; having a super-high-resolution watch display is important to you.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the solar charging capabilities on the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar make it our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">favorite Garmin smartwatch for battery life</a>.

<hr>
<p>Google I/O 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">the most developer-focused developer conference</a> we&apos;ve seen in quite a while, and it was full of AI talk. The phrase was mentioned in some form or another more than 120 times, in fact. For consumers, most of the AI features mentioned won&apos;t have a tangible impact on the way they use technology. That&apos;s with the notable exception of one feature — AI scam call detection — that could become the most important Android feature added to the platform in years. </p><p>Google is testing scam detection alerts. Although the company shared a preview of the feature in action at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2024">Google I/O</a>, we don&apos;t have a release date or many details at the moment. Google promised to share more details "later this year," and that&apos;s the best timeline we have. Still, the idea behind the feature is a great one, and it looks impressive in demos. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're testing a new feature that uses Gemini Nano to provide real-time alerts during a call if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams. This protection all happens on-device so your conversation stays private to you.

<p>The proposition is simple: AI will help unknowing users avoid falling victim to a cell phone scam. It uses on-device AI to detect words and phrases commonly associated with phishing scams and alert the user that the call they&apos;re receiving is likely a scam. For example, in the demo video, Google showed off a scam detection alert that appeared after a so-called "bank representative" asked a user to transfer funds to a new account. </p><p>Essentially, the AI model would be trained to figure out what kinds of requests have a tendency to be fraudulent. The most common type of phishing scams today involve scammers asking people to pay them through gift cards. As such, AI scam call detection could inform a user that a scam is likely once the caller asks them to send gift card redemption codes. </p><p>Surprisingly, the feedback coming from users on social media about AI scam detection hasn&apos;t been overwhelmingly positive. However, this feature has the potential to do the most good of anything announced at Google I/O, and here&apos;s why. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-call-screening-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro call screening" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6sYDy7nJGY5qbZ43aGV9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, let&apos;s address the obvious question: do we really need AI to tell us that we shouldn&apos;t transfer our life savings based on one unsolicited phone call? It might be hard to believe, but the answer is yes. Chances are, if you&apos;re reading Android Central, you probably have a higher understanding of tech literacy and internet safety than the average person. Technology enthusiasts can spot scams instantly, and most of us know better than to even pick up the phone when we don&apos;t know the number and aren&apos;t expecting a call. </p><p>Not everyone is well-versed enough in technology to spot scams quickly and effectively. Older people often fall victim to these types of scams more often than anyone. We can all probably think of someone in our lives who might be fooled by a scam phone call, especially as scammers evolve and find new ways to try to trick people. </p><p>If you still aren&apos;t convinced spam calls are a massive problem in 2024, here are some numbers to back it up. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024/#scam-detection" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing this feature, Google referenced a study from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newswire.com/news/global-losses-to-scammers-exceed-1-trillion-as-1-in-4-lose-money-to-22145725" target="_blank">Global Anti-Scam Alliance</a>. It found that just in 2023, people around the world lost an estimated $1.026 trillion to scams and identity theft. The report included 49,459 people from 43 countries and shows just how prevalent scams are. </p><p>Though these are estimated figures, we have more concrete data in the U.S. The FBI releases an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank">Internet Crime Report</a> each year chronicling the reports of online theft and scams and the amount of money that was stolen. In 2023, there was a whopping $12.5 billion lost due to digital scams in the U.S. That&apos;s up from $10.3 billion in 2022 and $6.9 billion in 2021. The number of online scams and the amount of money lost are both sharply increasing. For reference, only $3.5 billion was lost in 2019 — so the amount of money lost has tripled in a five-year period. </p><p>There are all different kinds of online scams and identity thefts that contribute to the Internet Crime Report. However, the largest number of complaints reported to the FBI came from phishing scams. In 2023, there were 298,878 reports of phishing scams in the U.S., and that&apos;s more than all the reports from the other four categories combined. </p><p>For those unfamiliar, scams using the phishing method try to trick users into willfully giving up information or money. When someone calls you pretending to be a bank or the IRS, for example, they are attempting to phish your credentials or cash. These are precisely the types of scams that Google&apos;s scam detection feature could thwart using AI.</p>
<h2 id="google-won-apos-t-be-listening-to-your-calls-x2014-it-apos-s-all-processed-on-device-2">Google won&apos;t be listening to your calls — it&apos;s all processed on-device</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qwsi2QkSGmUwD49qgj9MFX" name="Google-IO-2024-Gemini.jpg" alt="Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2024 describing Google Gemini AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qwsi2QkSGmUwD49qgj9MFX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s feature works by analyzing your calls in real-time and matching words and phrases with those commonly used in scams. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-must-balance-ai-features-with-privacy">Sounds like a privacy nightmare</a>, right? Actually, it isn&apos;t because Google is using on-device processing for the whole thing. For years, companies have used on-device processing to keep certain sensitive types of information from leaving your device. Google has the Titan M2 security chip, and Apple has the Secure Enclave. </p><p>In this case, Google is using the Gemini Nano model to detect potential scams in your calls. That means Google won&apos;t be able to listen to your calls or even collect any data from them. It&apos;ll all happen on your phone, using Google&apos;s smallest AI model, without any information being sent down to the company. </p><p>This does come with its downsides, like phone compatibility. Since it uses Gemini Nano, the scam call detection feature would likely only be compatible with certain phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> if it launched today. Gemini Nano is said to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">coming to the Pixel 8</a> later on and could be coming to more phones in the future. But for the sake of privacy, only devices capable of running Gemini Nano will be able to make use of this functionality. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve long said that AI will be far more beneficial to the casual, uninformed tech users than the enthusiasts — especially in the beginning. A perfect example of this concept is Google&apos;s plan for AI scam detection alerts. They might not help you or me, but they will help tons of people avoid scam attempts before they are put in an awful situation. </p><p>These are the kinds of features that can be the difference between a life-altering mistake being made and a crisis being easily avoided. That&apos;s why, throughout all the AI nonsense Google went on about at I/O, these scam detection alerts are what I&apos;m most looking forward to seeing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The Motorola Razr&apos;s specs have been leaked a couple of times now, but this new leak gives us a glimpse of what it might look like alongside information on a cheaper Razr model. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50-ultra-design-specifications-leak-exclusive/" target="_blank">91Mobiles</a>, the flagship Razr 50 Ultra (likely marketed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> in the United States) will sport a larger 4-inch cover screen with a 165Hz refresh rate. Regarding design, renders show a similar design to the Razr 40 Ultra/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a>, but the display is a bit larger, extending to cover nearly the entire front panel with a much smaller bezel. The leaked renders show that the dual cameras and flash unit remain unchanged, although the sensors pop out more. The hinge also looks smaller, but it&apos;s unclear if this is due to the image renders.</p><p>Other Razr 50 Ultra specs may include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 6.9-inch OLED with a 165Hz refresh rate, dual 50MP cameras, and 12GB of RAM. The publication points to 512GB of storage, although other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-motorola-razr-plus-2024-specs-leak">reports</a> say it could have 256GB. One image also shows a 45W charging adapter, as Motorola will reportedly increase the charging speed to top the 4,000mAh battery more quickly.</p><p>Rumors suggest that Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024 could come in three colourways— green, blue, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz</a>, in a vegan leather finish on at least one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This week, OpenAI introduced its new flagship model, GPT-4o, which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time. According to the company, the "o" in GPT-4o is "omni," referencing the model&apos;s multimodal interaction capabilities. Tests and demos of the GPT-4o model have impressed users and AI researchers. </p><p>The new model can answer questions about your surroundings with vision, talk to you with audio, and respond to text. Not just that, OpenAI says that the model can deliver responses to questions asked with a voice in a flash, 232 milliseconds to be exact. The average response time is 320 milliseconds, according to OpenAI.</p><p>While all this may seem magical, it could be bad news for the creators of dedicated AI hardware devices. All the features deemed exclusive to new hardware, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and the Humane AI Pin, will eventually be available straight on your phone through ChatGPT. This means that instead of paying $200 for the Rabbit R1 or $700 for the Humane AI Pin (plus $24/month), you can get the same functionality for free on your phone with OpenAI.</p><p>Text and image input were rolled out in API and ChatGPT on Monday (May 13), and voice and video will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

Vigneault added that China has "a very clear" strategy to use TikTok to obtain data "from anyone around the world."</p><p>During Vigneault&apos;s appearance on The House, he stated that TikTok is "risky" for adults and teenagers in Canada. The reason is reportedly China&apos;s usage of "big data analytics" and computer farms for data processing and crunching. He adds that China could use user data captured in Canada and other places worldwide to create artificial intelligence.</p><p>In 2023, the Canadian government <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/government-tiktok-phones-ban-1.6761737">banned TikTok</a> from all federal government devices, citing security reasons. The decision was backed by a review conducted by the Chief Information Officer, which found that TikTok&apos;s data collection methods could lead to cyber-attacks.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Canada will take a similar approach to the U.S. regarding this controversial app.</p>

The alerts are said to work with AirTags, Find My-compatible devices, and Bluetooth trackers compatible with Google&apos;s Find My Device network. Other brands, Chipolo, Eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee, have all committed to supporting the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers standard for future products.</p><p>When the notification appears, users can take a few steps. First, they can ignore the notification if they know about the tracker—like if they&apos;re traveling with a friend and iOS or Android detects their keys. Or, they can see the device&apos;s identifier, play a sound to help find it and take steps to disable it with instructions. These steps will vary based on the type of tracker. </p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Sony launched its new flagship phone, Xperia 1 VI, earlier this week. The company is bringing in a "smarter" display with a 6.5-inch BRAVIA-powered screen that is reportedly 1.5 times brighter than its predecessor. Sony has also worked on "Sunlight Vision," which is designed to give users more screen visibility when outside.</p><p>Powering the device&apos;s capabilities is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> with Sony&apos;s in-house Exmor T sensor for the cameras. The company states that the flagship phone features a 52MP (48MP effective) primary lens, a 12MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The telephoto lens has up to x7.1 zoom with an 85mm to 170mm focal length alongside macro technology. The Xperia 1 VI also offers AF tracking with "human pose estimation." The feature reportedly "recognizes" a human frame (skeleton) to provide the Xperia 1 VI with "precise" tracking even through objects that could cover a person&apos;s body.</p><p>The device comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box and a 5,000mAh battery. It will hit the market in June for £1,299 (roughly $1,646) and comes in black, Khaki Green, and Platinum Silver colorways. Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t appear to be launching in the United States.</p><p>Along with the Xperia 1 VI, Sony also launched its mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia10 VI,</a> with a bigger battery and stereo speakers.</p>

It&apos;s not really surprising because Google was one of the original pioneers of consumer tech AI and it has been hiding it in plain sight for years. Now, because AI is the new hot buzzword, all bets are off.</p>

<p>Much of what Google showed us will be coming soon or is already here. Other things are pie-in-the-sky projects that may never see the light of day. Remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-parent-alphabet-pulls-plug-its-ambitious-loon-internet-balloon-project">Project Loon</a>? Both real products and ones that will never come to market have one thing in common: they are potential privacy nightmares.</p><p>This, too, is nothing new to Google. Because of how the company operates, it <em>has</em> to be a bit on the invasive side. When our data is the force that drives revenue our data is going to be collected and analyzed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-anything-really-free">Nothing in life is free</a>, even Gmail.</p>
<p>Much of what&apos;s coming will be managed locally thanks to some flavor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>. I don&apos;t want Google listening to my phone calls, but as long as it&apos;s done <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on my phone</a> and not in a cloud server room somewhere, I&apos;m not going to freak out about it. Similarly, the "new" Gmail will use AI to help manage my inbox. That data is already in Google&apos;s cloud, so I don&apos;t care. I might even turn it on.</p><p>Some other examples were a bit more worrying.</p>
<h2 id="google-sees-all-your-stuff-and-google-never-forgets-2">Google sees all your stuff and Google never forgets</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PcHydwgxU4C6AoMQJFsrqg" name="google-io-2024-project-astra-schrodingers-cat.jpg" alt="Google Gemini's Project Astra says "Schrodinger's Cat" while looking at two drawn cats and a box with a question mark on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PcHydwgxU4C6AoMQJFsrqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also showed off a couple of ideas that are privacy nightmares in the making. Soon, we may have to worry about Google&apos;s object recognition just like we (should) worry about Google&apos;s facial recognition.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">Project Astra</a> was possibly Google&apos;s coolest announcement in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-keynote-made-cool-ai-features-look-boring">terrible I/O Keynote presentation</a>. We saw an interactive assistant who could see and hear everything we could and then act on the information it was gathering. </p>
<p>A lot of people got laser-focused on a potential next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-glass-enterprise-edition-2-now-much-easier-buy">Google Glass</a> that was shown in the demo, but I sprung to attention when Astra said, "Your glasses are on the table next to the red apple." 🚨🚨</p><p>I&apos;m not going to lie; this could be a helpful tool in a lot of ways for a lot of people. I jokingly remarked that we&apos;ll never again lose the remote control, but there are real practical uses. Like, where is my EpiPen or emergency inhaler? Finding either of those is a bit more important than finding your keys in most situations.</p>
<p>But — and there is always a but — some serious issues could arise from this. Imagine a subpoena for Google user data asking if Astra ever saw any sort of contraband in your home. Anything from marijuana to ammunition to birth control could be incriminating, and if Google has access to this data, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms/information-requests?hl=en-US">will comply with a lawful subpoena</a>. It has to. </p><p>I&apos;m not condoning anything illegal because it&apos;s just none of my damn business what you do inside your home. I&apos;m also not saying a tool used in this way is always going to be bad — sometimes cops need all the help they can get. I&apos;m just saying that it could happen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VtE2oxfCfwna2R5Ln9hjWJ" name="google-project-astra-pictionary.jpg" alt="Playing Pictionary with Google Project Astra at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VtE2oxfCfwna2R5Ln9hjWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seemingly more innocent, but potentially far more dangerous, was Google knowing your car&apos;s license plate number. My God, there are a bunch of ways this could be handy and helpful, but of course, it&apos;s also problematic.</p><p>Google can scan all of your photos and see which ones are of cars. It can use location data to see which photos were taken as well as the number of times a specific car appears to determine which car is yours. Then it reads the license plate number and keeps track of it.</p>
<p>That sounds innocent until you think about how this data could be cross-referenced. A judge may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/law-enforcement-using-google-maps-timeline-feature-cast-wide-net">sign a subpoena</a> for photos or data about any cars in the location of a crime when the crime was being committed. </p><p>That might help catch a criminal, but it&apos;s just as likely to get someone hauled into the police station to answer questions because they popped into Circle K for a snack or a drink right before someone robbed the place.</p><p>This type of object recognition, trained through your photos, isn&apos;t going to stop at car license plates.</p>
<p>Tools like these are powerful, and that means they can be dangerous. Google is really good at developing these sorts of things, and I&apos;m not going to think about how this tech could be used for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lays-off-more-employees-fires-protestors">military or law enforcement</a>, but it would be in high demand.</p><p>That means Google has to do it right. And it can. Exactly what this tech is doing, an overview of how it does it, and clear and concise information about what data is retained and its encryption status is a must. If Google doesn&apos;t start there, nothing else matters. Most of us probably won&apos;t read any of it before we tap the OK button, but it has to be there in plain language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8NbA4zL4PXEkD9L6BS7BaM" name="sidewalk-opt-in.jpg" alt="Amazon Sidewalk opt-in screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8NbA4zL4PXEkD9L6BS7BaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next step is making all of this opt-in. Unless you say, "I want it!" you&apos;re not getting it. Google is <em>usually</em> pretty good about this, but there have been "mistakes" where it just dumps new and invasive things onto you.</p><p>Finally, it has to decouple these features from everything else. If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-ai-image-generation-disabled">there&apos;s a problem</a>, shut it down, fix it, then push the fix to everyone before turning it back on. We can&apos;t afford to wait for Motorola to decide to update our phone to fix something this important.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;m cautiously optimistic. I have no doubt that Google can pull off the cool new tricks it has shown us because it already does things just as intricately and amazingly. I&apos;m also certain that tools like Astra can be useful in many situations, and I&apos;ll probably use them, providing the terms feel good to me.</p><p>Unfortunately, I&apos;m worried that Google will have privacy blunders along the way. It wouldn&apos;t be a Google product without them.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tdLsf8yh2ivHqMx4fnp82n" name="apple-stage-manager-ipad-pro-vs-samsung-dex-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra.jpg" alt="Stage Manager vs Samsung DeX - Apple iPad Pro vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tdLsf8yh2ivHqMx4fnp82n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung saw a decline in tablet shipments this quarter, with around 6.7 million units sold—a decrease from the 7.1 million units sold in the same quarter of 2023. Research manager Jitesh Ubrani at IDC points out this could be due to the slower economy. "It&apos;s essentially due to a slowdown in consumer demand in the U.S. for tablets, especially the premium tier," Ubrani told me over email. "Beyond that, there&apos;s also been an uplift in PCs, which steals a share of wallet."</p><p>It&apos;s not for a lack of trying on Samsung&apos;s part. Last year, Samsung launched the Galaxy Tab A9, Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, Galaxy Tab S9 FE, and Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus in the last quarter of 2023, later introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)</a> in the first quarter of 2024. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2024-results">Samsung&apos;s Q4 earnings report</a>, the company seeks to maintain sales momentum by expanding Galaxy AI to existing and new flagship products across foldable devices and tablets.</p><p>However, Samsung might face challenges keeping up with the premium range and the features that users may find appealing on iPads. Additionally, Ubrani says that even in the mid-lower tiers, Samsung faces competition from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-review">Amazon</a> and TCL in the U.S.</p><p>"To turn things around, Samsung can resort to bundling, which they have done and continue to do with wearables today. Beyond that, enabling new use cases—which is one of the toughest things to do for tablets—or servicing niche audiences (e.g., What iPad Pro is doing) is likely the only other way out."</p><p>On the other hand, Apple has also seen a similar decline in iPad sales this quarter. Even though it&apos;s at the top of the list, Apple faced a bit of a lull last year as sales declined 8.5% year over year. Per IDC&apos;s report, Apple focused on clearing out inventory of older models before the expected launch of new models. However, it could still ship out 9.9 million units this quarter. Ubrani feels that Apple&apos;s recent refresh of the iPad Air and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">iPad Pro</a> will go a long way and turn things around for the tablet business.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.12%;"><img id="vxuzHTNv2BymyzfKjPRa9H" name="Xiaomi-Pad-6-02.jpg" alt="Xiaomi Pad 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxuzHTNv2BymyzfKjPRa9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1360" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Samsung and Apple may be at the top of the charts, Huawei held third place this quarter with impressive year-over-year growth of 43.6% and shipments of 2.9 million units. IDC interprets that the Chinese tech giant likely benefitted from the resurgence of its smartphone business and grew its market share by 2.8 basis points compared to last year.</p><p>Xiaomi also retained its spot in the top five, with a remarkable yearly growth of 92.6% and 1.8 million units in shipment. According to Ubrani, a few factors have helped the company boost tablet shipments.</p><p>"Xiaomi has been focusing on promotions, and most importantly, demand in Asia is recovering quicker than in the US. Asia also has lower penetration rates, so an uptick in demand is expected." The report stated that even outside China, its largest market, Xiaomi grew by triple digits across almost all regions where it ships.</p>

<p>While Samsung and Apple continue to dominate the smartphone market, analysts suggest they have to start focusing on consumer spending habits and trends as they seem to be shifting.</p><p>One crucial area of improvement could be innovation, as year-on-year tablet upgrades mainly focus on hardware changes like faster processors, better screens (iPad Pro&apos;s OLED upgrade), or sleeker designs—but these may not be enough for customers to spend the extra money on tablets. </p><p>These tech giants could explore software upgrades like implementing AI features that will address why tablets are bought in the first place—accessibility and ease of multitasking on the go. Integrating features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> into tablets could help benefit students, a demographic that could benefit from more accessible tablet options. This would provide a portable computing option with a smart assistant that summarizes lectures or helps them organize their day.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this demographic focuses on value. With the surging prices of smartphones, consumers are likely more interested in spending less on a tablet or not buying one at all. This is where bundling and promotions come into play, as Ubrani pointed out, especially for families looking for cost-effective options for kids and teens.</p><p>Finally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/tablets/?product1=sm-x910nzaexac&product2=sm-x810nzaexac&product3=sm-x710nzeexac">sheer number of tablet</a> options available could lead to "decision paralysis." By considering users&apos; needs and budgets, Samsung could benefit from simplifying its lineup while ensuring it continues to introduce unique features that make the choice less stressful. Nevertheless, it&apos;s clear that the current strategy isn&apos;t panning out, and Samsung may need to rethink its tablet strategy going forward if it wants to better compete with smaller brands.</p>

<hr>
<p>There have been a few leaks of Motorola&apos;s upcoming Razr flagship, but the latest gives us a possible glimpse at what it might look like alongside information about the successor of the cheaper Razr model.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-50-ultra-design-specifications-leak-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a>, who received specifications and renders of both models, the flagship Razr 50 Ultra (likely marketed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> in the United States) will sport a larger 4-inch cover screen with a 165Hz refresh rate. This is quite a bump from the current model, which has a 3.6-inch cover screen and a 144Hz refresh rate.</p><p>As for the design, renders provided to the publication by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1791479694325637586">Sudhanshu Ambhore</a> show a mostly identical design to the Razr 40 Ultra/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a>, but the display is noticeably larger, extending to cover nearly the entire front panel with a much smaller bezel. The dual cameras and flash unit appear mostly unchanged, although the sensors seem to protrude a bit more. The hinge also looks smaller, but it&apos;s unclear if these details are just a product of the renders.</p>

<p>From the renders, we can see all the rumored colors for the Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024, including green, blue, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz</a>, with what appears to be a vegan leather finish on at least one of them. One image also shows a 45W charging adapter, as Motorola will reportedly increase the charging speed to more quickly top up the 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>Other Razr 50 Ultra specs may include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 6.9-inch OLED with a 165Hz refresh rate, dual 50MP cameras, and 12GB of RAM. The publication points to 512GB of storage, although other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-motorola-razr-plus-2024-specs-leak">reports</a> seem conflicted on this amount, which has also been listed at 256GB.</p><p>Additionally, 91Mobiles also got their hands on specs and renders of the cheaper Motorola Razr 50/Razr 2024, which will likely be the direct successor to the Razr 40/Razr 2023. From the images, the biggest change will be the cover screen, which will reportedly match the 3.6-inch size of the current Razr Plus. It also looks like it will combine design cues from both the current models, with a vegan leather finish on the back and covering the top section above the cover screen.</p><p>For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a> features an all-vegan leather design, but the Razr Plus only features the finish on the back, while the aluminum frame extends above the cover screen.</p>

<p>As for specs, it looks like the Razr 50/Razr 2024 will be a paired-down version of the Razr 40 Ultra/Razr Plus. The leak points to a MediaTek Dimensity 7300x chipset, 120Hz OLED panels on the front and back, a 50MP primary camera with a 13MP secondary sensor, and an 8+256GB configuration. The battery will be unchanged at 4,200mAh, but there&apos;s no word on charging speed, nor does the publication mention wireless charging on either model.</p>

<p>What&apos;s more, the renders were corroborated by known leaker Evan Blass, who posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1791515612243439873">official-looking images</a> of both Razr phones, showing off their designs and colors.

The Razr 50 Ultra/Razr Plus 2024 appears to have different textures on the green and blue color options.</p>

<p>If these leaks and renders are to be believed, it looks like Motorola is doubling down on the cover screen experience, which is my favorite thing about the Razr Plus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">why I prefer it to Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The Razr 2023 had a much smaller external display, which is only good for viewing notifications and a few other functions like selfies and voice recording. Reusing the Razr 40 Ultra/Razr Plus design and screen size would make it a much more attractive phone and give more people a reason to pick one of Motorola&apos;s phones over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5">Galaxy Z Flip</a>.</p><p>Other leaked specs point to IPX8 water resistance, which will also help Motorola compete with Samsung and other popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> on the market.</p><p>That said, the big thing we don&apos;t have much clarity on is the price, which will be a crucial element when the phones are launched, especially the more affordable model. The current Razr 40/Razr 2023 already undercut most other flip phones, and even with the launch of the extremely affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>, the price cuts on the Razr make it a much more attractive pick for just $499. Hopefully, Motorola can retain last year&apos;s pricing for its foldables to help drive sales.</p><p>For now, we just have to take everything with a grain of salt until Motorola officially launches the phones, which we expect could be very soon.</p>

<p>A rumor is floating around Samsung&apos;s upcoming clamshell foldable, which could solve the annoying side of these unique devices.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27911">TheElec</a> (Korean), Samsung is allegedly planning to increase the thickness of the UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-screen-crease-reduction-leak/">SamMobile</a>). Reportedly, the thickness will increase to about 50 micro centimeters, up from 30 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>. It&apos;s suggested that this could reduce how defined the device&apos;s screen crease will appear.</p><p>Additionally, increasing the thickness of the Flip 6&apos;s UTG could also aid in the display&apos;s durability.</p><p>The report adds that Samsung may stick with the same waterdrop-style hinge that it used on the Flip 5 for the Flip 6. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-5-display-durability-testing">previously tested</a> the hinge to withstand almost 200,000 folds, and the hardware was designed to help cut back on the dreaded screen crease.</p><p>However, the Korean publication states a redesigned hinge and UTG could arrive for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in 2025.</p><p>It&apos;s said that the new UTG for the Flip 7 could become "even thicker" to reduce the appearance of the screen crease even further. To do this, Samsung will supposedly need to revamp the clamshell&apos;s hinge structure to support how thick the UTG will become. Samsung will likely upgrade its waterdrop-style hinge, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see to know for certain.</p>

<p>With improvements rumored for the internal display, previous rumors suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">its cover display</a> could get some, too. In March, there was speculation that Samsung could boost the Flip 6&apos;s cover display refresh rate to 120Hz. A little more memory could arrive, with rumors suggesting 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Flip 6 was rumored to feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-charging-speed-rumor">a larger battery array</a>, which could total 4,00mAh.The following theories don&apos;t excite us, as the device could still sport the same boring 25W charging speeds as its 2023 predecessor.</p><p>Samsung is expected to drop its next wave of foldables and other devices later this year. It&apos;s currently suspected that the company could do so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">even earlier this year</a> on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>
