                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-vows-veto-defense-spending-bill-unless-repeal-section-230-regulations-included">Section 230</a> of the Telecommunications Decency Act is a very important law that allows the Internet to function as it does today. Without it, your favorite website would either cease to exist or change in ways that make it unrecognizable. We need these protections because, without them, we would have no way to express ourselves online if we didn&apos;t agree with whoever is tasked to moderate the content.</p><p>But it&apos;s also a very broad law that needs to be reformed. When it was written in 1996, nobody could predict the power that a few tech firms would wield or how much influence social media sites would have on us all. As situations change, the laws governing them must do the same.</p>
<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/22-3061/22-3061-2024-08-27.pdf">recent decision by the Third Circuit US Court of Appeals</a> has ruled that ByteDance, the parent company of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">TikTok</a>, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230523/tiktok-blackout-challenge-lawsuit-appeals-court">responsible for the distribution </a>of harmful content even though it is shielded as its publisher. It&apos;s a tragic story of a 10-year-old girl trying the "blackout challenge" she saw in a TikTok short and dying of asphyxia as a result.</p><p>The child&apos;s mother sued for negligence and wrongful death and the case worked its way through the courts to the Third Circuit. The next stop is the Supreme Court. While the case is a terrible one, the ruling from the Third may be what&apos;s needed to revamp Section 230 and hold big tech "accountable" while shielding them at the same time.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to TikTok for a statement and will update this article when we receive one. </p>
<p>There&apos;s a difference between a publisher and a distributor. If I write a post on X or make a video on TikTok encouraging illegal activity, X or TikTok are only publishing it. Once their algorithm picks it up and forces it upon others, they are distributing it.</p><p>You really can&apos;t have one without the other, but the third has decided 230 stating "<em>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider</em>" does not protect the publisher from the consequences of distributing the content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.13%;"><img id="YexNcJtLbfnJHTy7FAwBM3" name="facebook-logo-pixel-2-2-6cia-6cia.jpg" alt="Facebook logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YexNcJtLbfnJHTy7FAwBM3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t agree with the Third&apos;s reasoning here simply because it&apos;s distributed <em>as a result</em> of it being published. Then again, I have no say in the matter because I&apos;m just some dude, not a circuit court judge. It does point out that social media giants have to have some incentive to better police their content, or the law needs to be changed.</p><p>No, I&apos;m not calling for censorship. We should be able to say or do any dumb thing we want as long as we are willing to deal with the consequences. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Metas</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">ByteDances</a> of the world don&apos;t have to like what we say or do and can yank it down any time they like as a consequence. </p><p>Without Section 230, they would do it a lot more often and that&apos;s not the right solution.</p>
<p>I have no idea how you fix things. I don&apos;t need to know how to fix it to know that they are broken. People collecting much larger salaries than me are responsible for that.</p><p>I know a 10-year-old child should not be enticed to asphyxiate herself because TikTok told her it was cool. I know nobody working for ByteDance wanted her to do it. I also know that no amount of parental control could prevent this from happening 100% of the time.</p><p>We need legislation like Section 230 to exist because there is no way to prevent terrible content from slipping through even the most draconian moderation. But it needs to be looked at again, and lawmakers need to figure it out. Now could be the right time to do it.</p>

My wife is the total opposite, though, which means I often have some time to kill before she wakes up and we can start the day together. While I could lay in bed and play games on my phone, I&apos;d rather not disturb her.</p>

<p>It&apos;s better to head out to the living room and play some games on my Steam Deck or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, but I don&apos;t like to play active games right away. Instead, I&apos;d rather have a cup of tea and relax on the couch, which means the games I&apos;m playing are all pretty chill. While people often think of VR games as being more active—many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> are, after all—plenty of games are designed to be played seated or even at a table.</p><p>For this week&apos;s column, I&apos;ve collected my four favorite casual games I love to play in the morning. My main criteria was that they not only had to be casual—meaning I can put them down at any time without worry—but they also can&apos;t require the use of controllers. Hand tracking games only!</p><p>For maximum comfort, I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M3-Pro-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0CJLG9SBR">Bobo M3 Pro</a> headstrap in the morning and remove the facial interface for the Quest 3 entirely. That leaves things open so it&apos;s easier to drink my tea and play without worrying about sloshing it on my headset. Some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> might also help, but I think it&apos;s best to keep things simple for the morning.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oYqiDWsPzfEcwekBS9Zo8J" name="wordomi-screenshot.jpg" alt="A mixed reality screenshot of Wordomi on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYqiDWsPzfEcwekBS9Zo8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Field Of Vision)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/wordomi/7368881886507513/">Wordomi</a> has been my new favorite morning game recently, combining everyone&apos;s favorite word game, Wordle, with a little bit of Scrabble or crossword-type puzzles thrown in.</p><p>Each level begins by giving you a handful of letters and a word to solve. Easier levels are usually just three letters to solve a three-letter word—so you can take some time to wake up without immediately feeling super challenged—while the harder levels will present you with more complex words and leftover letters, making you think a bit more.</p><p>As you progress, the game starts to take on a Scrabble flavor with words building off each other in different directions. Wordomi takes great advantage of mixed reality and the spatial nature of VR by letting you grab and move around the "board," or just getting up and walking around it if you so choose. You can even choose to play it on a table, with the word blocks falling and landing realistically on the table when you drop it.</p><p>Like Wordle, Wordomi&apos;s words are randomized rather than being set levels that you can eventually complete. This is a game designed to be played regularly and the structure fits that very well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9WsW8pPXCBLtGWaTPEyuBU" name="cubism-mixed-reality-meta-quest-3-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cubism mixed reality gameplay on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WsW8pPXCBLtGWaTPEyuBU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Thomas Van Bouwel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But if you&apos;re not a big fan of word games, I&apos;ve got two shape puzzles that you might enjoy more. First up is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/cubism/2264524423619421/">Cubism</a>, which made waves way back in March 2021 when it became one of the first hand tracking games on Quest.</p><p>Cubism is a clever, super casual play at your own pace puzzler that tasks you with building large shapes out of smaller ones. Each level gives you the outline of the large final shape, plus pieces that closely resemble Tetrominoes from the classic game Tetris. Unlike Tetris, however, you won&apos;t be sweating bullets to get shapes in by a certain time.</p><p>Not only is Cubism the perfect pace for an early morning game, but it also gives you the freedom of playing it on a table like Wordomi. Cubism actually pioneered this design, and it feels just as magical now as it did when it launched alongside the Meta Quest 3 a year ago.</p>

<p>And if you enjoy even more complex puzzle shapes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/puzzling-places/3931148300302917/">Puzzling Places</a> takes the concept of those expensive 3D puzzles and brings them into VR, complete with realistic rendering of 3D scanned buildings.</p><p>Puzzling Places lets you choose not only different real-life places and buildings to piece back together, but also gives you the option of changing the difficulty for each level to suit your tastes.</p><p>The game received a fantastic hand tracking <em>and</em> multiplayer update at the end of 2023, making it perfect for the category of casual morning games. If you&apos;re fortunate enough to have multiple Meta Quest 3 headsets (or a Meta Quest Pro) around the house, you can even join up with housemates and solve puzzles together!</p>
<h2 id="morning-in-the-city-2">Morning in the city</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwAthw_qE2o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for something a little more visually involved but still casual at heart, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/little-cities/4988470131168299/">Little Cities</a> is the perfect way to wake up and get your brain going. It&apos;s a classic city-building simulator like Sim City, but with a far more relaxed tone. That means that while you&apos;ll manage important things like water, power, and even cell phone towers, most mechanics are far more simplified than in that classic city builder.</p><p>Hand tracking in Little Cities works like a dream, too. It&apos;s ultra simple to play without controllers thanks to the game&apos;s clever UI, which gives you a smartwatch to check all your stats with, plus handy floating bubbles that you&apos;ll pop to select each option.</p><p>While you&apos;re totally immersed in the world instead of playing in mixed reality, there&apos;s no reason to stand up and walk around thanks to an ingenious use of board game-like mechanics. Each city takes place in an island, and you&apos;ll grab the island and move it around to reach every area. You can even "pinch and zoom" by grabbing with both hands and moving them closer or farther apart.</p><p>Since Little Cities autosave constantly, you don&apos;t need to worry about when to stop playing. Just take the headset off and rest assured that you&apos;ll find yourself right where you left off. Plus, several different save slots, a full campaign, and even a sandbox mode ensure that there&apos;s plenty to do and lots of great ways to build the city of your dreams.</p><p>Waking up is more fun with VR, and since you don&apos;t need controllers, you can still get that morning induction of caffeine while chilling on the couch.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors have continued to mention a Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Slim," but recently those whispers swapped to a "Special Edition" and this leak might&apos;ve shown it off early.</p><p>An alleged photo of the device has surfaced courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/exclusive-first-look-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-design.html">Android Headlines</a> and the phone in question sports a few notable differences. The device is rumored to take its thickness down to 10.6mm when folded and roughly 4.9mm when unfolded. This is only moderately thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and its 12.1mm measurement when folded.</p><p>Additionally, the supposed photo suggests that the device will continue to sport that boxy look, but with slightly rounded corners for handheld comfortability.</p><p>The back of the device has streaks running vertically, potentially indicating a "brushed metal finish" as the publication notes. Moreover, rumors claim the device could have a thin layer of glass above that finish as extra protection.</p><p>Another difference on the rear panel is the triple camera island. On the standard Fold 6, this island is pill-shaped and conforms to the shape of the top and bottom lens (since it&apos;s rounded). This alleged Fold 6 "Special Edition" picture claims that Samsung is moving toward a rectangular shape for the array.</p><p>It also seems that the typical camera bump will exist on this next model. A small LED flash can be seen off to the right side of the array, as well.</p>

<p>Something to remember is that the Fold 6 "Slim" or "Special Edition" was rumored to feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-titanium-panel-rumors">titanium rear panel</a>. It was stated that Samsung was "reviewing" the idea of implementing the material due to its lighter weight and heightened durability over standard options. This <em>could </em>still be the case. It&apos;s difficult to tell visually from the photo and without Samsung&apos;s official say-so.</p><p>For its cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-clues-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-slims-launch-date-and-camera-upgrade-surface">rumors claim</a> the Korean OEM will upgrade the phone&apos;s UDC (Under Display Camera). The Fold 6 "Special Edition" could pick up a 5MP UDC, up from 4MP, to help with sharpness and detail. What&apos;s more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/08/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-major-camera-boost.html">publication notes</a> that the phone could include a 200MP primary sensor on the back.</p><p>With how speculation is shaping up, it feels like the Fold 6 Special Edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-rumored-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-special-edition-might-not-be-all-that-special">won&apos;t be all that special</a>. The marginally slimmer estimations on the device&apos;s thickness (which today&apos;s rumor doubles down on) might not entice consumers as much. However, one shining rumor is the upgraded camera system, which Samsung might finally do for this "Special Edition."</p><p>Regardless, this next Fold 6 variant is rumored to arrive in South Korea on September 25 and could cost a whopping 2.8 million won (~$2,100).</p>

<ul><li>Google now offers Pixel 9 series repair manuals for download from a support website.</li><li>The manuals aren't concise, being hundreds of pages in length, but they are clear and readable even to people without prior repair knowledge.</li><li>Google executives have said in the past that they want everyone to be able to repair their phones, and quality manuals and guides are key to that future. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is heavily involved in the right-to-repair movement, partnering with iFixit and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">backing legislation</a> in recent years. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ifixit-breakup-highlights-google-efforts">Samsung&apos;s deal with iFixit fell apart</a>, Google&apos;s partnership is thriving. Some disagree on the means and methods that Google uses to design its phones and achieve greater repairability. However, now that the company has shared its Google Pixel 9 series repair manuals, it&apos;s clear that Google is at least doing one thing right. </p><p>Its guides are publicly available, easy to read and understand, and might just empower users to learn more about their devices. Google has publicly stated its goals for Pixel repairability, but unlike a few other manufacturers, the company actually backs it up with right-to-repair initiatives. </p><p>Earlier this year, an episode of the Made by Google podcast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-wants-to-design-pixel-phones-to-be-repairable-without-special-tools">featured an interview with Steven Nickel</a>, who runs consumer hardware operations at Google. Nickel&apos;s role includes making sure Pixels are designed with repairability at the forefront. In the interview, Nickel said that Google "want[s] everyone to be able to do repairs." That future may be far out, but there are things Google can do today to bring the Pixel repair experience closer to that dream.</p><p>"We want to get to a point where you can reach into a kitchen drawer and be able to replace your screen," Nickel added.</p><p>As it stands currently, the average person can&apos;t take apart and repair their smartphone at home, for many reasons. There are technical concerns, sure, but part of the issue is that manufacturers have spent years fear-mongering about everything that can go wrong when self-servicing your tech products. In the past, companies like Apple and others have warned about the dangers of replacing your battery, which should be one of the simplest and most-common repairs. </p><p>Of course, lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous if mishandled, but the same goes for many other things we interact with on a daily basis. For example, working on your car can be dangerous for the inexperienced, but that doesn&apos;t stop people from doing so while being cautious and willing to learn. So, empowering users and giving them the knowledge to work on their phones is half the battle for the right-to-repair movement. </p><p>There&apos;s no doubt that there are technical issues that need to be addressed before the average person can fix their phones and devices at home. Google still has work to do there, but it&apos;s dominating the other half of the battle, which is empowering users with knowledge. It first started issuing English repair manuals in December of last year, and last week, Google released the repair guides for all four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series devices. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fMUduBYuxw5pVEKDtsYBkW" name="Pixel-9-Official-Repair-Guide-Google.jpg" alt="A Pixel 9 repair guide from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMUduBYuxw5pVEKDtsYBkW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that consumer repair guides released by major tech companies have been a form of "malicious compliance" in the past. In other words, even the manufacturers that released repair guides wrote them for experienced repair professionals rather than average consumers. If you tried to look at one of Apple&apos;s repair guides with no prior knowledge or experience with smartphone repair, you&apos;d probably end up so confused that you&apos;d never try to repair your own stuff again. </p><p>I&apos;m a bit biased as a tech reporter, but to me, Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series repair guides are some of the easiest to decipher of the consumer tech repair guides out there. In the image above, taken from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14725410#zippy=%2Cenglish-manuals" target="_blank">Pixel 9 repair guide</a>, you can see a detailed and colorful expanded view of the Google Pixel 9. Each part is identified and labeled, so you know exactly where everything is located. The following page details the locations of every screw inside the Pixel 9, its size, and whether it&apos;s hidden or visible.</p><p>This might sound like a stretch, but I&apos;ve read Ikea assembly instructions that were way more confusing than this Pixel 9 repair guide. It&apos;s thorough and accessible, which are two words I never thought I&apos;d use to describe a repair manual officially-released by a big tech company. Even if you aren&apos;t ready to fix your own devices at home, simply reading through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> series manuals will teach you a lot about the devices you use. </p><p>Big tech corporations have created a stigma around independent and at-home repair, causing notions that it&apos;s dangerous or unreliable. In order for the right-to-repair movement to thrive, that stigma needs to be reversed. To me, the first step is education. Users need to learn more about their devices, how they work, and how they break and are ultimately fixed. After combing through the Pixel 9 repair manuals, no major company is doing a better job at educating their users than Google. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google announced that "Ask Photos" in the Photos app has now entered early access and users can begin signing up for its waitlist.</li><li>Ask Photos leverages Gemini to discover content stored in your gallery when given a descriptive query.</li><li>Google Photos is also rolling out an improved search experience for Android and iOS users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google details some new things stable app users and testers can expect from Photos.</p><p>As part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/">Google Labs&apos;</a> AI testing environment, the company states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-ask-photos-early-access/">in a post</a> that users can get their hands on "Ask Photos." This new feature in Google Photos lets users leverage the AI model Gemini for questions about their stored content. The post adds that Gemini will "understand the context" of your photo gallery, meaning it <em>should </em>recognize "important" people, food, and more.</p><p>Users can get descriptive during their queries to Gemini in Photos. Google&apos;s provided example shows a user asking about what they ate at a hotel in a specific town (Stanely). After a brief moment, Ask Photos will scour your photos before surfacing what it believes fits your question.</p><p>Google states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini">Ask Photos</a> can even understand items in your content like camping gear. However, the AI search could get things wrong, in which case users are encouraged to offer "extra clues or details" to help it.</p><p>Aside from searching for a singular photo, Ask Photos can create a collection of images from a recent trip. For example, Google says a user could ask "what were the top 10 things we saw in Idaho." Ask Photos will go through that trip before surfacing what could fit your query&apos;s criteria.</p>

<p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that some of your questions given to Ask Photos may be taken by Google to train the AI. The company states it will protect your privacy by "disconnecting" the query from your account, ensuring your anonymity during review.</p><p>Users interested can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">join the waitlist</a> for Ask Photos today (September 5) and see if they can snag a spot.</p><p>Elsewhere, today&apos;s update for Google Photos brings an improved search experience for Android and iOS users. The post highlights the app&apos;s ability to understand "everyday language" when searching for a photo. Some examples include "Alice and me laughing" or "Emma painting in the backyard."</p><p>Google has included sorting options such as relevancy or by date to help users find what they&apos;re looking for as the app turns up results.</p>

<hr>
<p>As rumors surface about what&apos;s next from OnePlus, its CEO confirms a piece of hardware that could arrive with its next flagship phone.</p><p>Following the BOE Global Innovation Partner Conference, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/OvrayCAIr">OnePlus President Li Jie</a> confirmed that another device will use BOE&apos;s top-tier display (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-boe-x2-display-brighter-better-3478254/">Android Authority</a>). The post explained that the partnership will "push" the bounds of screen quality and brightness. What&apos;s more, the continued use of BOE&apos;s flagship display means OnePlus consumers will receive additional eye protection.</p><p>Li Jie states the new BOE X-series display will take its "eye protection experience to a new peak in the industry."</p><p>The company president reiterated its partnership with BOE last year for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, which featured the "X1" screen. It was a 2K resolution display that received an A+ DisplayMate rating.</p>

<p>OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-boe-x1-display-reveal">held a conference</a> for the 12 series&apos; display last year, which reportedly broke 18 records on its way to that A+ DisplayMate rating. The Chinese OEM plugged in OPPO&apos;s P1 chip to assist the BOE display with its color accuracy, grain reduction, and improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>.</p><p>That device only offers 4,500 nits of peak brightness, designed to help users with "optimal sunlight readability." The COO of OnePlus Kinder Liu <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">informed Android Central last year</a> that the Display P1 chip helped to bring a "custom sunlight high-brightness algorithm." It was then discovered that OnePlus alternates between DC-like dimming and standard PWM methods three times per refresh cycle.</p><p>Essentially, it multiplies the PWM rate for a more comfortable viewing experience for those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity</a>. Even at a lower brightness, OnePlus still jacked up the PWM rate of the flagship 12, beating out the likes of Samsung and Apple.</p><p>With OnePlus delivering confirmation behind another generation of BOE display, likely an "X2" model, theories state it could hit the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>. In a way, such speculation makes sense considering the X1 was used on the OnePlus 12. The next flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">is rumored to use</a> a 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display. So, we&apos;ll have to see what happens during its (supposedly) slightly earlier launch this fall.</p>

Much like "AI" and "X% faster," it&apos;s one of those things we hear about every product, and none of the companies making them ever bother to tell us why it matters.</p><p>What&apos;s different about it is that you probably do care about having it, even if you have no idea what it means beyond "content looks better." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> has a set of tools for developers that will make that content look even better as long as an app developer cares enough to use them.</p>
<p>Specifically, I&apos;m talking about this cryptic bit from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/09/android-15-is-released-to-aosp.html">the release notes</a>:</p><p>"For screens that contain both HDR and SDR content, Android 15 allows you to control the HDR headroom with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/Window?hl=en#setdesiredhdrheadroom" target="_blank">setDesiredHdrHeadroom</a> to prevent SDR content from appearing too washed-out."</p><p>I&apos;m sure Google&apos;s explanation tells you everything you need to know, and you&apos;re excited to see this great new feature in your phone and favorite apps. If you&apos;re developing apps that show this type of content, that&apos;s true, but for the rest of us, it takes a bit more explaining.</p>
<h2 id="hdr-vs-sdr-2">HDR vs. SDR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:137.41%;"><img id="ikifqSmfoXz7UDMH2FguuA" name="Android-HDR-screen-example.jpg" alt="Side by side comparison of HDR10 video on Google Camera app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikifqSmfoXz7UDMH2FguuA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1080" height="1484" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "DR" in HDR and SDR stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a>; HDR has <em>high</em> dynamic range, and SDR has <em>standard</em> dynamic range. The dynamic range of a display has an upper end of brightness and a lower end of brightness. Any content falling outside this range will not be displayed using the correct color and contrast.</p><p>You have seen this in action, and it&apos;s easy to demonstrate. This evening go outside and take a picture of the sunset. Look at the photo and compare it to what your eyes actually see and you&apos;ll find a lot of detail and colors just aren&apos;t quite right. those bits have fallen outside the dynamic range of the camera, the display, or both.</p>
<p>To use numbers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.viewsonic.com/library/photography/what-is-hdr-hdr-vs-sdr/#:~:text=High%20Dynamic%20Range%20(HDR)%20is,Standard%20Dynamic%20Range%20(SDR).">ViewSonic gave me a quick answer</a> when I went looking for them. An SDR ViewSonic display has a dynamic range of about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://exposuretherapy.ca/what-is-the-stop-in-photography/#:~:text=In%20photography%2C%20a%20stop%20is,same%20as%20dividing%20by%20two.)">6 stops</a>, and an HDR ViewSonic display has a dynamic range of about 17.6 stops. The display on your phone may not use the same numbers, but they will be comparable. You&apos;ll notice HDR can display a lot more colors than SDR.</p><p>Yes, all this translates into colors. Inside the dynamic range of the display, you can <em>mostly</em> see individual colors. With an HDR display, you can see more bright colors and darker colors. Viewing the same content on an SDR display means those colors are going to mix — grey looks like black, ivory looks like white, you see fewer shades of yellow, etc.</p><p>In short, you want a good HDR display on your phone, TV, or computer because you want the colors and brightness to look "right."</p>
<h2 id="when-you-cross-the-streams-2">When you cross the streams</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="kpA5necQNWRh7MS8kcrVHR" name="HDR-SDR-Crystal-Red-Shrimp.jpg" alt="HDR vs. SDR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpA5necQNWRh7MS8kcrVHR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text"> Photo showing content saved with an SDR profile then displayed as an HDR image versus doing it the right way. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The real problems arise when you try to set a display using HDR data but then display SDR content on it. </p><p>SDR content has already lost all the color and contrast information outside of its dynamic range. It&apos;s simply not there. That&apos;s fine when it&apos;s being displayed as SDR content, but as soon as your screen expects HDR content with a broader range of information about what it should show, it&apos;s left with a big chunk of missing data.</p><p>If AI has taught us anything, it&apos;s what happens when a computer doesn&apos;t have the right data but has to give a result anyway — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">it makes stuff up</a>.</p>
<p>Your phone is usually smart enough to know what kind of content is being displayed and will correctly display both SDR and HDR imagery without any input from you. Sometimes, though, an app will need to display both types of content at the same time. Apps like social media, photo storage and galleries, or even a web browser showing an image picker can often have both types of images on the same page.</p><p>Inevitably, the SDR content gets washed out. That can mean the darker parts of the image turn all muddy and mix into a single color, or the lighter parts do the opposite. Everything above or below the range threshold is either white or black, or the whole image looks like it has a dull filter over it. Generally, it just looks bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time, this is just a minor inconvenience and really doesn&apos;t matter. Sure, we want everything to look great, but if a photo or two on a page of thumbnails looks goofy, it&apos;s not a big deal, especially if once you open one, the image is displayed correctly.</p><p>For other folks who might earn a living through their content, it has to be displayed correctly. A photographer needs the photo gallery on their phone to give an accurate rendition of how that content looks. A videographer might need to know if they should change their settings by looking at the thumbnails of the clips. Or maybe it just bugs you, and you want it to look correct.</p>
<p>With Android 15, developers writing apps that display content can set the app to try and not wash out those SDR images but still allow HDR images to "pop" because they show a better, brighter image. However, that&apos;s only if developers bother to implement it; you can lead a horse to water.</p><p>By default, your phone knows the right amount of brightness and contrast increase that should happen when showing HDR content but developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/Window?hl=en#setColorMode(kotlin.Int)">can have some control</a> inside their apps. Now, they have even more control to try and keep all content looking the best it can.</p><p>These are the kinds of little things we&apos;ll see more and more of with each new Android version. The hard part—building an operating system that works well and has the features we all want—is mostly done, so it&apos;s time to fine-tune everything to make it even better.</p>

It launched this summer and immediately became the favorite of Android Central&apos;s resident Dad-tech expert Nick Sutrich. It&apos;s a watch that keeps things simple and enjoyable for your young&apos;un while giving you peace of mind.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-recommend-this-fitbit-watch-for-your-kid-2">Why we recommend this Fitbit watch for your kid</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f" name="fitbit-ace-lte-wearing-02.jpg" alt="A child wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is essentially a squircle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> running a stripped-down Wear OS interface that (unlike the Pixel Watch) can still connect with parents&apos; iPhones, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. It&apos;s fast, comfortable on small kids&apos; wrists, has cute games that encourage activity, and keeps track of their location.</p><p>As Nick explains in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-best-watch-for-kids-in-school">Fitbit Ace LTE review</a>, most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids watches</a> are designed like plastic toys, or something you&apos;d see in a 50s sci-fi show. They&apos;re "thick and chonky," and the unoptimized software is just as unsightly. They fulfill their purpose and let kids stay in touch, but they&apos;re not going to enjoy wearing them once the novelty wears off.</p><p>But Fitbit has been making slim squircles and coding its popular Fitbit OS for over a decade — well before Google acquired it — and that expertise comes across in the Ace LTE. While it comes with a thick bumper case if your kid gets too rough with their toys, it&apos;s "so darn sleek looking" by itself, so kids will <em>feel</em> like they&apos;re wearing an "adult" smartwatch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR" name="fitbit-ace-lte-fishing.gif" alt="Playing the fishing game on a Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A fishing game on the Fitbit Ace LTE </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the surface, the Ace LTE software is tailor-made for kids to hit their 60 minutes of activity a day; finishing quests like step goals or just moving around instead of sitting will net them "movement points" that they can cash in to play games. Nick&apos;s kid loves the space strategy game that has him point his wrist to fire attacks at ships, but he knows he can&apos;t start the next level unless he gets active first.</p><p>You can also use those points on your Eejie, which Nick calls "a sort of Tamagotchi-meets-Animal Crossing-type virtual pet." Gaining points lets you customize your Eejie in fun ways so kids have a visual incentive to stay fit. </p><p>Unlike more adult-focused fitness watches that track complicated metrics, the Fitbit Ace LTE keeps things simple: steps, floors, light activity, and moderate-to-vigorous activity. It doesn&apos;t have tools like sleep tracking or manual workouts that any other Fitbit can manage, which feels like an intentional decision to avoid overcomplicating things, distracting kids with a screen at night, or stressing parents out about kids&apos; sleep habits.</p><p>In a similar vein, the Fitbit Ace LTE deliberately limits the amount of screen time kids can get, with five minutes or so of earned gaming time after 20+ minutes of activity. My colleague argued that parents should be allowed to tweak this ratio to make the screen incentive a bit more fun, but at least you won&apos;t have to worry about the Ace becoming a time-suck distraction for your kid.</p>

<p>Really, all of this is just window dressing, meant to make your kid feel good about staying active at a young age instead of sitting around watching YouTube. The main reason to buy any kids smartwatch is to give them a way to call or text you (and other family members) without giving them a phone.</p><p>Unlike with a smartphone, you don&apos;t need to worry about your kid getting messaged by strangers. The Fitbit Ace LTE calls dedicated contacts set up via the Android/iOS Fitbit Ace app; if you want your kid to be able to call or message, say, a grandparent or sibling, they&apos;ll also need a smartphone with the Fitbit Ace app and a Google account, which is only a downside if your family members aren&apos;t tech-savvy.</p><p>You&apos;ll need the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/whats-included-with-the-fitbit-ace-pass-subscription">Fitbit Ace Pass subscription</a> for LTE calling; it can still call over wi-fi, but you&apos;ll want cellular connectivity for things like broadcasting your kid&apos;s real-time location through the Fitbit Ace app. It&apos;s a relief for parents to be able to check, though unfortunately, Fitbit hasn&apos;t implemented a geofencing tool that auto-notifies you if the kid leaves a designated area, like the school grounds. </p><p>Geofencing is the <em>one</em> feature found on other kids watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUp</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids#section-how-it-works">Garmin Bounce</a> that we wish the Fitbit Ace LTE offered, too. But hopefully, you&apos;ll be satisfied with the ability to check your kid&apos;s location at any time, such as if you lose track of them in a store or at the park.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-best-watch-for-kids-in-school">recommended the Garmin Bounce</a> as the back-to-school watch to beat, and it&apos;s still a great option. It&apos;s cheaper (with the same monthly fee for LTE calling), better for battery life, and fitness-focused. But if you can afford the Fitbit Ace LTE, it&apos;s arguably better for both hardware and software.</p><p>Google is continuing to update the Ace LTE, adding an NFC tap-to-pay feature — with approval from parents, of course — new games, and a promised feature to let kids message other kids with Ace LTE watches later this year. This gives us hope that it may receive updates like geofencing down the line; even without it, this is a great kids watch that should last you through multiple school years.</p>

It&apos;s not as powerful as competing products from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or Apple. It doesn&apos;t have the same GPU that spits out numbers faster than software can use them. It&apos;s not even very efficient. It&apos;s not <em>bad,</em> and it certainly does its job in ways almost everyone can appreciate, but it&apos;s not some over-the-top super chip.</p><p>Except when it comes to AI. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-new-google-ai-features-claims">Google&apos;s AI</a> in particular. Google has complete iron-fist-level control over its entire AI stack. It writes the software, designs the algorithms, controls what parts are off-loaded to a cloud-based server and it designed the NPU inside its in-house processor to best take advantage of it all. </p><p>The only company that might do something comparable would be Apple, once it weans itself off its dependence on OpenAI. Samsung could do it, but it is in the business of selling electronics and not building out AI tech on such a scale or working on its own mobile operating system.</p>
<p>Other companies are certainly capable of making advanced AI-capable chips. Qualcomm can do it and is doing it. They do a good job at it, too, by all accounts. Certainly, a good enough job to include much of Google&apos;s AI features alongside other features from companies like Samsung on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>. </p><p>I&apos;m concerned, though, about the news that Qualcomm is going even harder into AI with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> and that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-bye-exynos-qualcomm-galaxy-s25-rumor">reportedly seems determined to use it</a> in every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> around the world. Not because it won&apos;t be capable or because I think Samsung should use a different chip.</p><p>The power for all this has to come from somewhere.</p>

<p>Supposedly, insiders know that devices using the Gen 4 will need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">6,000mAh batteries</a> because the chip is very power-hungry. High-density batteries using unnamed materials are close to reaching those numbers but who knows when this tech will be ready for release.</p><p>Samsung will want to make the S25 as thin as possible because phone makers are convinced we want even thinner phones. Other manufacturers will follow the same playbook, even if it means using too-small batteries.</p>
<p>Often, we&apos;re told how easy and fast it is to top your phone off during the day because it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-does-fast-charging-hurt-my-phone-battery">charges so quickly</a> whenever battery life is brought into question. That&apos;s a poor substitute for a bigger battery, especially for anyone who isn&apos;t around an outlet all day long. As a crutch, we need to buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">portable batteries</a> or deal with a phone that doesn&apos;t last long enough.</p><p>The answer is obvious, even if it will never happen. Make the phone thicker and include a bigger battery. If you insist on incorporating so much AI you need a chip capable of running it fast enough, you need to provide it. Or simply forgo some of the AI and realize that Google simply has an advantage in that space. Samsung doesn&apos;t need to match Google with AI to build a great product or even one that&apos;s better.</p>
<p>Google is never going to license its tensor SoC design nor will it try to write Android in a way that doesn&apos;t leverage its AI capabilities. That&apos;s Google&apos;s advantage and it knows it.</p><p>Forcing a phone that won&apos;t run all day without charging on your customers is not the solution and nobody is asking for AI features that might make it happen.</p>

<hr>
<p>Govee today unveiled a new set of smart curtains that promise to elevate your home to a whole new level of fancy.</p><p>In a press release, Govee boasts that the second-gen Curtain Lights come with a "refined lighting display" thanks to enhanced computing power and storage. The big win here is improved GIF performance, with "richer" and more detailed patterns plus an expanded 10 canvas layers.</p><p>The device features a new chip and 520 light beads. Govee also offers two-pack and three-pack options so you can really amp up your colorful displays.</p><p>Taking the Curtain Lights 2&apos;s enriched experience even further is its improved DIY effects.</p><p>The company promises an easier setup with a streamlined customization section. There’s a DIY material library with Govee’s own elements to jazz up your Curtain Lights 2, or you can upload your own photos or GIFs and see them come to life.</p><p>Another new addition for the Curtain Lights 2 is Govee&apos;s first steps into AI via the "AI Lighting Bot." The company states this lets consumers utilize its voice commands alongside a text-based option to control the device. Not only can users control the Curtain Lights 2, but they can also "create" new designs and patterns using this AI tool.</p><p>The AI can aid in creating "static lighting effects." However, Govee informs that the "gif/dynamic lighting effect is coming soon." The company adds that the Curtain Lights 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.govee.com/pages/govee-dreamview-release">fully compatible with DreamView</a> for a "fully immersive experience."</p>

<p>Installation is a breeze with the Curtain Lights 2, which can be used indoors or outdoors. Both the lights and control box have an IP65 waterproof rating. Govee has also thrown in hooks, adhesives, tape, and installation strips to help you set it up anywhere around the house.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter support</a> is another aspect of the Curtain Lights 2 that separates it from the original model. Now, users can pair the device with other ecosystems like Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit. To make pairing seamless, users can scan the provided QR code to get started on their network.</p><p>Those interested in the Govee Curtain Lights 2 can pick it up in a single pack for $149. Its double pack starts at $259 while the triple pack sits at $399.</p>
