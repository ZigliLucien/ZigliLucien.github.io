As part of the retailer&apos;s daily "Rollback" offerings, Walmart has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black/797596359"><strong>dropped the price of the 2022 watch down to just shy of 100 bucks</strong></a>, no strings attached. Seeing how the Galaxy watch originally retailed for $349.99, this is a major, major discount. The only catch is that it could disappear at any time, and knowing Walmart, this will likely happen sooner rather than later. </p>

<p>For a limited time, Walmart is selling the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (42mm version) for a wee $99 on its website. Despite its age, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> holds up as a great device for most folks, with a real rotating bezel, solid Wear OS performance, and a suite of intelligent health and fitness tracking features. And again, it's $99.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Smartwatch-Detection-Bluetooth/dp/B096BKVWZZ">Amazon - $153</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black/797596359" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="89b54da8-4204-4c3d-bf38-24ddcf74cf79" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm: $349.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm: $349.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you own a Samsung phone; you don&apos;t mind using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> from 2022; you have a smaller wrist (this deal is for the 42mm watch). </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford a newer Samsung smartwatch.</p><p>To put it simply: if you don&apos;t want to spend much more than $100 on a new smartwatch, this is without a doubt the best deal on the web today. Sure, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a bit old at this point, but it still holds its own against a lot of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">best Samsung watches</a> on the market. You still get the physical rotating bezel with a stainless steel casing (similar to the construction of newer Classic models), plus up to 40 hours of battery life, Wear OS, and a comprehensive suite of health tracking features straight out of the box. </p><p>This Walmart deal comes just a few days before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-spring-sale-2024-early-deals-predictions-and-what-to-expect">Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale</a>, a major shopping event that&apos;s sure to rival Prime Day and Black Friday when it comes to great tech deals. That Amazon sale event runs from March 20th through the 25th, but if you don&apos;t want to wait to pick up your new watch, this rollback offer is for you. </p>

<p>There are a lot of great smartphones to choose from nowadays, and, comparing the OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro shows how difficult a decision can be. While there are a few similarities between these two devices, both OnePlus and Google offer a bit of "flair" to help each phone stand out from the pack.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-design-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK" name="oneplus-12-31.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 next to OnePlus 9, OnePlus 10, and OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/idULYP7YsgEfrRmJhvUaGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both of these devices stay true to their predecessors in terms of the overall design. They also offer unique and distinct camera layouts as Google has stuck with the "visor" with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> utilizes essentially the same rounded camera cutout as the OnePlus 11.</p><p>Where the Pixel 8 Pro might appeal more to some is in the display. Google is finally using a flat panel, as opposed to the curved screen from previous models. The display of the OnePlus 12 remains largely unchanged, as there are slight curves on either side. This makes it one of the few remaining flagships to feature a curved panel, as Google, Samsung, and others are moving back to flat screens.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-12-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 12 vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2WyfCGhDf6xUMQs2TVo8AH" name="oneplus-12-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 about page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WyfCGhDf6xUMQs2TVo8AH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>LTPO OLED seems to be the display type that many companies are implementing, and that rings true for OnePlus and Google. With the OnePlus 12, you&apos;ll enjoy a 6.82-inch display, sporting a 3168 x 1440 resolution, and a 120Hz variable refresh rate. As for the Pixel 8 Pro, we have a 6.7-inch panel, with a 2992 x 1344 resolution, and the same 120Hz variable refresh rate.</p><p>However, where the OnePlus 12 pulls away is in the peak brightness of its display. Both of these devices provide 1,600 nits of brightness in normal conditions, but the OnePlus 12 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">can max out at 4,500 nits</a>. This is a massive improvement over the 2,400 nits of peak brightness offered by the Pixel 8 Pro. What this boils down to is that you&apos;ll have a far easier time using your OnePlus 12 while out and about, compared to Google&apos;s offering.</p>

<p>When it comes to "horsepower" it won&apos;t take long to see that the OnePlus 12 arguably offers a more performant package. It&apos;s powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, the same chip found in many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released so far. This is paired with either 12GB or 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, along with 256GB or 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4LtysQQJuZboJ7uTZcoMVk" name="meta-quest-3-google-play-store-01.jpg" alt="The Google Play Store on a Google Pixel 8 Pro in front of a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4LtysQQJuZboJ7uTZcoMVk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are the latest devices to be powered by Google&apos;s in-house SoC. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> ends up being slightly more performant compared to the G2, but offers much-improved power efficiency. Like the OnePlus 12, the Pixel 8 Pro features 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM but comes with more storage configurations, ranging from 128GB all the way up to 1TB.</p><p>Comparing battery life introduces another interesting comparison. The OnePlus 12 has a larger 5,400mAh cell, while the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s 5,050mAh battery gets the job done. However, OnePlus has implemented 100W SuperVOOC wired charging and 50W wireless charging into the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s not even a fair comparison, to be frank, as the Pixel 8 Pro maxes out at 30W or 23W, respectively.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s such a thing as an "Achilles heel" with the OnePlus 12, it&apos;s the software. Long gone are the days when OxygenOS was exciting and tuned to the user, as the company has merged it with ColorOS. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-interview-gary-chen-zach-lin">current state of OxygenOS</a> is much better than when this adventure originally began, but it still might not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea.</p><p>On the flip side, Google&apos;s "Pixel experience" remains largely the same compared to previous iterations. Material Design is still widely prevalent if you want it, and everything just kind of <em>works</em> without needing to fiddle too much. However, OxygenOS has a definite edge when it comes to various features such as the larger folder windows, and the ability to use icon packs without relying on a third-party launcher.</p>

<p>Outside of aesthetics, Google has an edge in terms of how long it claims to be supporting the Pixel 8 Pro. The company announced that both of its most recent devices will receive up to seven years of software updates. Meanwhile, OnePlus has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-president-throws-shade-at-seven-years-of-updates">steadfast</a> in sticking with four years of major OS upgrades, and five years of security patches.</p><p>We don&apos;t know what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">the state of the software</a> will look like in seven years, so you&apos;ll have to take Google&apos;s announcement with a grain of salt. But, at least on paper, it&apos;s refreshing to see Google finally fall in line with Samsung when it comes to the longevity of software support.</p>

<p>None of that even mentions the various AI enhancements and features that were announced and are still coming to the Pixel 8 Pro. Since launch, the Pixel 8 Pro has received "Summarize in Recorder," Smart Reply in Gboard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>. Not to mention seeing improvements to staple features such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-lens-google-photos">Google Lens</a>, Live Translate, and Pixel Call Assist.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 fails to offer any similar features or functionality to compete on the AI landscape. However, that might change in the future, as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-12-receives-new-ai-features" target="_blank">recent update</a> to the Chinese variant brought "AI Summarizer," "AI GC Remover," and "Article summaries" to the OnePlus 12. Unfortunately, we aren&apos;t sure whether these features or any others, will make their way to the OnePlus 12 in other regions.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re interested to see if OnePlus has finally managed to compete with the likes of the Pixel 8 Pro, then you&apos;re in luck. Both of these devices sport a triple camera array on the back, headlined by a 50MP wide-angle lens, paired with a 48MP ultrawide sensor. As for zoom capabilities, the OnePlus 12 utilizes a 64MP telephoto lens capable of offering 3x optical zoom. The Pixel 8 Pro, uses a lower 48MP telephoto sensor but features an optical zoom of 5x.</p><p>Even when you take into account the software processing, the photos you take will be pleasant, regardless of which device. It really comes down to whether you prefer Google&apos;s processing and the ability to zoom in a little bit closer.</p>

<p>In our review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">Harish says</a> that the OnePlus 12 is "on par with the likes of the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 Pro." It&apos;s not until you start getting into the digital zoom territory that the cracks of the OnePlus 12&apos;s camera system really start to show.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, your pictures are still going to look fantastic, including photos shot in low light. But, Google <em>finally</em> listened to its users and implemented a Pro Mode, although it&apos;s currently only limited to the 8 Pro. Obviously, this is something that OnePlus, Samsung, and others have offered for years. But, it&apos;s nice to see that you can finally take control over the various settings when taking pictures without the use of third-party apps.</p>

<p>At this point, you wouldn&apos;t be "wrong" picking either the OnePlus 12 or Pixel 8 Pro. However, there&apos;s one more consideration to be made, and that&apos;s the price. The Pixel 8 Pro with 128GB of storage is priced at $999, moving up in increments depending on if you want more storage. The OnePlus 12 with its 256GB of storage comes in at just $799.</p><p>That&apos;s a $200 difference right off the bat and is actually $300 if you bump up the Pixel 8 Pro&apos;s storage to match the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s really tough to argue in Google&apos;s favor here, even if it offers more in the way of AI features compared to OnePlus.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a better overall chip, OnePlus seems to finally have nailed the camera tuning, and the 12 charges <em>much</em> faster than the Pixel. However, at the same time, you can get the Pixel 8 Pro from your local carrier or big box store. If you want the OnePlus 12, you won&apos;t be able to enjoy any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-oneplus-12-deals-of-the-month">carrier deals</a> and have to go through the likes of Best Buy, Amazon, or OnePlus directly.</p><p>If that&apos;s not something that concerns you, then I would suggest just going with the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s a much better value, while being more powerful, having a brighter display, and a larger battery. Plus, OxygenOS does continue to get better with time, even if it&apos;s still not quite on par with the Pixel in some areas.</p><p>However, those who <em>can</em> take advantage of various carrier and trade-in deals might just be better suited for the Pixel 8 Pro. We&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">plenty of deals</a> that knock hundreds off the price, so there&apos;s a good chance you can trade in your current phone and get the 8 Pro for the same cost.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm has a new flagship-tier chipset dubbed Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, which the company announced will power some of the premium-tier flagships from OEMs like Honor, iQOO, Realme, Redmi, and Xiaomi.</p><p>The new chipset marks the first Snapdragon 8s series, previously seen in the 7 series portfolio, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-7s-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 7s Gen 2</a>.</p><p>According to Qualcomm, the new chipset sits between the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>. The chipset comprises device-generative AI features, an always-sensing ISP, hyper-realistic mobile gaming, breakthrough connectivity, and lossless high-definition sound, notes Qualcomm in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/03/qualcomm-brings-the-best-of-on-device-ai-to-more-smartphones-wit">announcement post</a>.</p>

<p>The on-device generative AI features include Gen AI assistant, Gen AI image generation, and support for popular Large Language Models (LLM) like Baichuan-7B, Llama 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>, and Zhipu ChatGLM.</p><p>Despite falling under the SD 8 Gen 3, the 8S Gen 3 borrows some of its features like 18-bit triple Cognitive ISP, photo expansion, Snapdragon LLV (Low Light Vision), 2x sHDR, and Qualcomm Aqstic Speaker Max technology. The latter promises to reduce distortion when music is played in higher volumes. The gaming-centric features involve Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing and Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.</p>
<p>On the performance end, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 packs in one prime core CPU with promised clock speeds of up to 3.0GHz (a tad shorter than the 8 Gen 3, which sits at 3.3GHz). The octa-core CPU is further backed by four performance and three efficiency cores. The 5G-enabled chipset includes a Snapdragon X70 5G Modem-RF system — the same one seen on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><p>Other notable features of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 include Quad HD Plus display support at 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10/10+ support, Quick Charge 5 technology, support for LPDDR5x memory, a UFS 4.0 interface, and USB 3.1 Gen 2.</p><p>Lastly, the aforementioned OEMs will likely bring their first-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> featuring the chipset in the coming months; however, Qualcomm notes that Xiaomi could be the first to join the list with a device coming later this month.</p>

<ul><li>The newest beta update for WhatsApp on Android introduces new ways to unlock the app.</li><li>In addition to biometrics, testers will be able to use face IDs and passcodes to open WhatsApp.</li><li>This could be particularly beneficial for devices that don’t offer biometric sensors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp continues to work hard to ensure its users&apos; privacy, with recent examples including rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-has-started-blocking-screenshots-of-profile-pictures">blocking screenshots of profile pictures</a> and beta testing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-chats-end-to-end-encryption-labels">end-to-end encryption indicator</a> to tell users whether or not their conversations are secure. The newest update further seeks to protect users by improving the app lock feature.</p><p>Beta update 2.24.6.20, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-20-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-bolstering-app-lock-new-authentication-methods/">Android Police</a>), allows testers to unlock WhatsApp using various methods, including fingerprint, face ID, or even the passcode for the phone it’s on. </p><p>When users enable the app lock, they can use “fingerprint, face or other unique identifiers to open WhatsApp.” Previously, the app lock was only available using biometric authentication, which meant that it was unavailable for users whose phones didn’t have a biometric sensor. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WTS4f3MojMM38yEBeK7nSj" name="WhatsApp app lock beta.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the changed app unlock screen on WhatsApp beta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WTS4f3MojMM38yEBeK7nSj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, those users can potentially lock WhatsApp and use an alternate method to unlock it, such as a passcode. And, as WABetaInfo points out, anyone with a broken or malfunctioning biometric sensor on their device would also benefit from having alternative ways of unlocking WhatsApp. </p><p>WhatsApp currently offers two ways of securing conversations on the app: the first is with the app lock, and the second is via chat lock for specific conversations. If you secure specific chats, you need to use a fingerprint or your face to unlock them. This update appears to apply only to the app lock, not the chat lock. Whether this is likely to be introduced at a later date is unclear.</p><p>Currently, this update is only available to some beta testers, with the expectation that it will be rolled out to more users in the coming days. However, users are being warned against installing this particular beta update as some are encountering crashes upon opening the app. Instead, beta testers are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1768377806633762968?s=20">being advised</a> to wait for a future update, which may fix this particular issue. </p>

<ul><li>A leaked internal Meta presentation suggests that the Meta Quest 3 Lite will be called the Meta Quest 3s.</li><li>The budget headset features a unique front-facing camera array and a design similar to the Oculus Go.</li><li>It's rumored the headset will launch this year for $299 and use older Quest 2 lenses but the more powerful Quest 3 chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We got our first look at a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3 Lite</a> in a now-deleted Reddit thread (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1769104387702460616?s=20">reposted on X</a>), revealing that Meta may call its new budget-priced VR headset the Meta Quest 3s.</p><p>The naming convention is a bit strange, as many products have used "s" after a number to denote a supercharged version of an existing product. This headset, however, is rumored to cost just $299 when it launches later this year, helping to fully replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta Quest 2</a> as the budget VR headset to buy.</p><p>The leak shows a headset design that&apos;s thicker than the Meta Quest 3 — something we expected given that Meta is likely still using older Fresnel lenses from the Quest 2 to save money — and the flatter design feels like it&apos;s borrowed from the classic Oculus Go headset from several years back.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Meta about the potential Quest 3s, but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Notably, the underside of the headset appears to feature just a power button and a volume rocker. No lens spacing adjustment slider or wheel can be seen, further suggesting that Meta could be using older lenses for this design.</p><p>Some have questioned the authenticity of this leak, citing that the original post was suspiciously deleted from Reddit and that the leaker "forgot" to remove their own face from the leaked presentation slides. The VR community has been duped recently with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/valve/prism-vr-headset">fake Valve Prism announcement,</a> posted on a website that looked authentic but turned out to be an elaborate hoax of the standalone headset Valve has been rumored to be working on.</p><p>Regardless of whether this design is authentic, we&apos;re very confident that Meta is launching a budget-minded Quest 3 headset this year. The original China-only launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-lite-china-plans-foiled">was allegedly scrapped</a> after plans to partner with Tencent fell through, leaving Meta to launch the headset elsewhere throughout the world to replace the aging Quest 2 in the price bracket.</p><p>Meta is said to be using the same powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 headset in the Meta Quest 3s as it uses in the more expensive Meta Quest 3. It&apos;s also said the headset will continue to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-first-details">color mixed reality</a> instead of the fuzzy black and white video from the Quest 2&apos;s cameras.</p>

Infinix’s All-Round FastCharge 2.0 technology takes things a step further with 100W <em>Multi-Speed FastCharge</em> (which can juice up your phone to 50% in just 8 minutes in hyper mode) and MagCharge. But the headline feature is the company&apos;s first in-house Cheetah X1 chip.</p><p>Infinix says its new dedicated chip outperforms traditional ones by a whopping 204%. According to the company, the chip&apos;s smaller size means electrical data doesn&apos;t have to travel as far inside the phone. Less distance means less heat, which equals better performance overall, as per Infinix.</p><p>The chip has three modules that cover a lot of ground. There&apos;s one for supporting different scenes, which means your phone can handle various charging functions like <em>Multi-Speed FastCharge</em>, <em>Bypass Charging Mode,</em> <em>Reverse Charge Mode</em>, and even multi-protocol fast charge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the high-precision power detection feature constantly checks how much juice is flowing into your phone in real time, and it adjusts settings automatically to prevent overheating and keep your phone cool. Furthermore, the safety protection feature is loaded with 63 different protection schemes to cover you throughout the whole charging process.</p><p>Wireless charging also got a boost to 20W Wireless Magcharge, up from 15W in last year&apos;s model. The company also announced the Infinix MagKit to make your magnetic charging experience super easy. It includes the MagCase for your phone, the MagPad charging pad, and the MagPower power bank.</p><p>The Note 40 series can also be charged even when it&apos;s as cold as -20 °C, according to Infinix. Plus, it has Bypass Charging 2.0, which filters current to keep your phone cool during intense gaming or binge-watching sessions.</p><p>You can share power with other devices, wired or wirelessly, at speeds up to 10W. And with PD3.0 protocol support, you can even charge your laptop using your phone&apos;s charger.</p><p>In addition to the Cheetah X1 chip, the Note 40 Pro and 40 Pro Plus include MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 7020 under the hood. However, the standard variant is powered only by the Helio G99 Ultimate processor. The Pro Plus has up to 24GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, while the standard and Pro models are capped at 16GB of RAM.</p><p>The rest of the features are what you&apos;d typically see in many of today&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">beloved budget phones</a>, including a 6.78-inch FullHD+ AMOLED screen for all models with Gorilla Glass G55 protection. The screens feature a 55-degree curve and Corning Gorilla Glass protection.</p><p>Keeping the lights on for the Pro Plus is 4,600mAh battery, while the Pro and regular variants pack a 5000mAh battery.</p><p>Infinix also introduced a new feature called <em>Active Halo</em> that blends AI and design. It gives the Note 40 series a whole new vibe by lighting up the camera module with lifelike pulsations. The light show changes depending on what you&apos;re up to, whether it&apos;s getting calls or notifications, playing games or tunes, charging your phone, or chatting with the voice assistant, Folax.</p>

<p>On the optics side of things, the lineup comes with slick in-sensor zoom tech that lets you get up close and personal with your shots. The phones flaunt a 108MP main camera to pull off 3x Lossless Superzoom. Plus, if you opt for the Pro series, you get Optical Image Stabilization thrown in for extra steady snaps. On the front, a 32MP camera handles your selfies.</p><p>The Note 40 series is hitting store shelves globally starting March 19, offering three color options: Vintage Green, Obsidian Black, and Titan Gold. Additionally, Infinix is teaming up with BMW&apos;s DesignWorks for a special Racing Edition dropping by midyear.</p>

<p>The Note 40 retails for a base price of $199, followed by the Note 40 Pro at $259, and if you&apos;re eyeing the Note 40 Pro 5G, that&apos;ll set you back $289. But if you want to go all out, the premium Note 40 Pro+ 5G comes in at $309. And no matter which model you pick, you&apos;re getting Infinix XOS 14 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> right out of the box. Plus, with the Pro series, you&apos;re covered with two years of Android OS upgrades.</p>

<ul><li>The B30 Pro 5G will retail for $299.99, though there is a special promotional discount. </li><li>It will have a 5,000mAh battery and a 6.7" FHD+AMOLED display. </li><li>The phone will launch in only one color for now (light green). </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>NUU introduced its latest device on Friday, the B30 Pro 5G, which brings some great specs at an affordable price. Featuring a 6.7-inch FHD+ AMOLED display screen with a variable refresh rate, the phone follows the success of the previously released NUU B20. </p><p>“With the B30 Pro, we’re not just launching a phone; we’re delivering a promise of affordability without compromising on excellence,” Danny Sit, CEO of NUU, said in a statement. </p><p>The handset features Gorilla Glass 3 on the back, with Dragontail glass protecting the display and a polycarbonate mid-frame. Internally, it boasts 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage along with a 5,000mAh battery with 30W fast charge capability, fairly impressive specs when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>. </p><p>As for the camera, it’s 108-megapixel for the main camera and a 32-megapixel camera for the front. Additionally, an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 2-megapixel macro lens are also built in. Bluetooth 5.2 and NFC capabilities are also built into the device. </p><p>Still, there are a few caveats to make note of. Currently, only one color option is available (light green), though a spokesperson told Android Central that more colors could be an option down the line. In that vein, the phone does not support wireless charging and is not IP-rated, which is important to determine how well the device holds up to water and dust. Lastly, it will launch being powered by Android 13 with a planned update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> slated for the summer.</p><p>Even with these caveats, the handset is affordable with a modest $300 price point, though interested consumers can take advantage of a special promotional offer and get the B30 Pro 5G for $269.99 from March 15 through March 31. </p><p>The promotional discount is the equivalent of the cost of a Google One Basic annual subscription ($19.99). As such, the subscription will be bundled with the phone, giving users 100GB of cloud storage and Google Photos editing features. </p><p>Interested consumers should know that the B30 Pro 5G will support T-Mobile’s network as well as its MVNO subnetworks. It also will have support for a minimum of two years for security and OS updates. </p>

<p>For the past year, the Garmin Forerunner 965 has been my go-to running watch; I&apos;ll wear a second watch for reviews, but no other option has supplanted it. This month, the Forerunner 165 came <em>very</em> close despite costing $350 less. </p><p>Technically, I&apos;m using the Forerunner 165 Music ($300 less), but I don&apos;t actually use the music storage. What matters is that this relatively cheap Garmin watch has the tools, UI, and accuracy I&apos;d expect from a more expensive model like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>.</p><p>Even though the Forerunner 165 has plenty of noticeable compromises to hit that lower price point, I can live with 90% of them — and I love how much lighter the 165 is than the 965. </p><p>But there&apos;s <em>one</em> missing Garmin Forerunner 165 feature from the Forerunner 265 or 965 that&apos;s really hard to pass up, no matter what kind of runner you are. And it&apos;s frustrating because it&apos;s something Garmin <em>could </em>easily offer with the 165&apos;s current technology.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3829px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmiSSQLrUp8BsY7VzKJhWc" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-in-hand.jpeg" alt="Glance views of race predictor and Recovery time on the Garmin Forerunner 165" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmiSSQLrUp8BsY7VzKJhWc.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3829" height="2154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 165 may not be as cheap as the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a> it replaced, but I think most runners won&apos;t mind the price creep in exchange for all the new perks it offers, like the more-readable AMOLED touch display, improved Elevate v4 heart rate sensor, and multi-GNSS tracking.</p><p>My recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">Forerunner 165 fitness test</a> proved that the watch delivers accurate results for steps, heart rate, GPS, and elevation gain compared to other cheap trackers, in ways the more pedestrian Forerunner 55 couldn&apos;t. </p><p>It gave me confidence that I don&apos;t necessarily <em>need</em> the more expensive Forerunners&apos; dual-band GPS, because the Forerunner 165&apos;s all-systems GNSS mode does quite well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-polar-h10-coros-pace-3-and-fitbit-charge-6-on-table.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 165, COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Polar H10 sitting together on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In my test, it beat out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, my other favorite cheap running watch with dual-band tracking, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">favorite fitness tracker</a>. While COROS&apos; watch lasts twice as long with its MIP display, runners who need more than the Forerunner 165&apos;s 11 days or 19 GPS hours probably won&apos;t buy a $250 watch. Instead, they&apos;ll prefer not having to strain their eyes to read notifications.</p><p>Like the PACE 3, though, the Forerunner 165 is satisfyingly light and skinny. At 39g/ 1.38oz, it&apos;s noticeably more comfortable than the 53g/1.87oz Forerunner 965. I get used to the 965 during runs, but I can&apos;t ignore its presence on my wrist like I can with the Forerunner 165 — especially during sleep tracking.</p><p>So long as the Forerunner 165 gives me my post-run Training Effect data and daily suggested workouts, I can stay on track with what I&apos;ve already been doing with my Forerunner 965. </p>

<p>To make the $600 Forerunner 965 or $450 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> more tempting, Garmin restricts a bunch of data from the Forerunner 165. Thankfully, I&apos;d call most of Garmin&apos;s metrics desirable but not "essential."</p><p>I can&apos;t deny that the Forerunner 965 helps me track my progress as a runner. I can see my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max graph</a> over the past four weeks, plus scores on how my fitness translates into Endurance and Hill strength over time. But I also think these appeal to me out of data-driven vanity, a way to validate that my training is working.</p><p>If you really need confirmation, the Forerunner 165 shows your current VO2 Max and a 4-week graph of your predicted race times; if the projections go lower, you know Garmin thinks you&apos;re getting faster. Otherwise, so long as you&apos;re keeping pace with what Garmin Coach or your daily suggested workouts tell you, you can typically count on improving over time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="f6nbjyuQEJJj4hkhPnZpfe" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-map.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 showing a topographic map of a nearby park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6nbjyuQEJJj4hkhPnZpfe.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every other useful Garmin metric — Training Status, Training Readiness, real-time stamina, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-performance-condition-needs-revamp">performance condition</a> — is mostly useful for beginner or intermediate runners who don&apos;t know enough to trust their own instincts. They quantify your body&apos;s aches, your wheezing lungs, or that spring in your step. </p><p>So long as I have Garmin&apos;s daily suggested workouts as a benchmark for whether to train harder or pull back that day, that&apos;s typically all I need to reinforce whether I&apos;m overreaching, peaking, or slacking off. Everything else comes from experience.</p><p>Out of all the nice-to-have features the Forerunner 965 offers, pre-downloaded topographical maps are the hardest to lose, as a nice backup if you go hiking in unfamiliar territory. But if I&apos;m honest with myself, I don&apos;t go hiking all that much and use Alltrails when I do so I can cope with the loss.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-is-blocking-the-forerunner-165-from-offering-its-most-useful-metric-2">Garmin is blocking the Forerunner 165 from offering its most useful metric</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zcoLThCRbUTjxDT9EmiqbH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-acute-load-score.jpeg" alt="A 7-day acute load graphic on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcoLThCRbUTjxDT9EmiqbH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Beyond all Garmin&apos;s optional perks, there&apos;s one data tool the Forerunner 165 lacks that I can&apos;t do without as a runner: Training Load. And I&apos;m pretty darn sure it <em>could</em> deliver that data... if Garmin lets it.</p><p>Without getting overly technical, Training Load measures how hard your body worked out on a given day based on your heart rate and oxygen consumption. You want to hit a certain Training Load every week and then slowly increase your load number every week, either by running more or running faster.</p><p>Your Load is split into three heart rate zone categories: Low aerobic, high aerobic, and anaerobic. Higher heart rates give you more training load in shorter intervals, but high-load runs also take longer to recover from. A low aerobic run is easier and causes less "load" on your body but slowly helps you improve your fitness over time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j8niAjAXrqY9BU5vaAJMsK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-load-focus.jpeg" alt="Training load focus on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j8niAjAXrqY9BU5vaAJMsK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It all sounds very data-driven, but it&apos;s basically all about balance. Garmin helps me remember if I&apos;ve done enough sprints, intervals, or slow jogs recently, without having to study my past workouts. And more generally, it tells me if I&apos;m keeping pace with past versions of myself or if I&apos;m over- or undertraining. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.79%;"><img id="nbN9hoo5JyViRbh4ozkqP6" name="Garmin-Connect-load-data.jpeg" alt="A screenshot of the Garmin Connect app showing the user's training load data over the past four weeks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nbN9hoo5JyViRbh4ozkqP6.jpeg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="1179" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Training Load isn&apos;t available on the Forerunner 165...or is it? Because buried in Garmin Connect app submenus, I found my Training Load data, up to the current date! And I&apos;ve only used the Forerunner 165 in the past week.</p><p>According to a Garmin rep, though, this Acute Load data is only available because I already have a Forerunner 965 associated with my account. "If you only had a 165 in your account, you would not see the load features at all," she explained. In other words, it&apos;s an arbitrary paywall rather than an actual 165 CPU limitation.</p><p>I also suspect that the Forerunner 165 could show my Training Load <em>Focus</em> for aerobic or anaerobic runs, if Garmin wanted. Why? Because just like the Forerunner 965, the Forerunner 165 takes "the user&apos;s training history" and "intensity" into account when suggesting a daily workout, according to my Garmin rep.</p><p>That includes "if there is a shortage in one area (e.g., base to build up base endurance, threshold to increase high aerobic training)," she continued.</p><p>So, with the Forerunner 165, you can look at the daily workout suggestions and guess what Garmin thinks about your current training load focus behind the scenes. You just won&apos;t have any way of checking the raw data for yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>My full Garmin Forerunner 165 review will come out soon, but I already think it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available. If I didn&apos;t already have both it and the Forerunner 965 in hand, I think I would happily accept the compromises of the cheaper model to save more than half off the price.</p><p>I just wish Garmin hadn&apos;t decided to make Training Load a feature you have to pay an extra $200 to get — or $100 more with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> — because to me, it&apos;s pretty darn essential.</p>

Another way to do it is to head to the overflow menu, tap on Details or Group details, and look for the "Change colors" option just below the images and videos section. A full-screen preview UI will pop up, offering nine choices that include the default color, blue, purple, green, orange, and pink, among other options.</p><p>Once you choose a new color for a thread, a message pops up at the bottom of the screen saying, "You changed the theme."</p>

Luckily, there are a ton of great choices when it comes to phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">a great camera</a> and while some are slightly better than others, almost every new Android phone can take awesome pictures.</p><p>We hear this all of the time — manufacturers tell us about camera advancements and features, and then a review breaks it down. It makes sense because technology advances. But last week, it hit me right in the face, and I was honestly surprised.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web&apos;s longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>In a very niche situation and in a very weird way, my laziness showed me just how great the camera on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> is.</p><p>I like aquariums; they keep me out of trouble. Mostly. Anyhoo, I was trying to sell some small pieces of coral online, and someone sent me a quick message about one particular piece. They asked me for a photo of it so they could see what they were thinking of buying.</p>
<p>Taking pictures of coral is really hard, even for a "professional" camera because of the lights used to make them grow. Corals need light of a certain wavelength and they can grow much like a plant, converting that light into energy. Our eyes don&apos;t see much of the light corals need, but it sure can mess with a camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2870px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL" name="coral-bad.jpg" alt="Photo of coral ruined by weird lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pKkPS3pnTvDH2sGAMxgbNL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2870" height="1614" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A photo of coral taken with my Galaxy Z Flip 5. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That science fiction-looking photo came from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, and it&apos;s not useful because it looks nothing like what your eyes would see. Much (most) of the time, if you point your phone at an aquarium while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.iquaticsonline.co.uk/what-is-actinic-lighting/">actinic lights</a> are on, you get something similar. We can&apos;t see it, but a camera sensor gets overwhelmed by the huge amount of UV light pouring into the lens.</p><p>You offset it with UV lens filters, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS3FYH5">this kit made for smartphones</a>. The science behind it is that the filters cut out light measuring 15k and 20k Kelvin (think super blue light that washes out everything else) while leaving the rest of the light data alone. The result is a photo that looks very much like what our eyes see without interference from all the UV.</p>
<p>Being too lazy to go and look for my little phone filter kit, I just pointed the Pixel 7 Pro at the aquarium and snapped a photo. To my surprise, I got this using Google&apos;s auto-settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2354px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bUdhz3ikRvsdCirrdwW5if" name="coral-good.jpg" alt="Pixel 7 coral photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bUdhz3ikRvsdCirrdwW5if.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2354" height="1324" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A photo of coral taken with the Pixel 7 Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s still a strange photo, but it looks very much like what my eyes see. And it wouldn&apos;t have been possible just a few years back. Even cooler, it can also do the same thing with video.</p><p>I can take bunches of photos of my fish tank with the Pixel 7 Pro, but not all of them are useful. I can also get a useful photo from other phones once in a while, too. I&apos;ve played with it enough to confidently say that if you&apos;re taking a picture without any "white" light, Google has figured out some way to make it work through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-computational-photography">computational photography</a>.</p>
<p>While improved lenses play a part, the real magic lies in using software to "make" a picture. Smartphones leverage powerful processors and sophisticated software to enhance image quality beyond what the sensor can capture alone. Techniques like HDR (High Dynamic Range) combine multiple exposures for balanced lighting, while noise reduction algorithms eliminate graininess in low-light photos.</p><p>The result, in my case, isn&apos;t a great photo — it&apos;s grainy, there&apos;s a lot of noise, and you&apos;ll see strange artifacts where I need to clean the glass. But it&apos;s a good representation of what you see, takes the glow away from the background, and it&apos;s pretty consistent. </p>
<p>I have no idea what software magic is being used to turn light our eyes can&apos;t see into an accurate representation of what is real because, in this case, "real" changes so much. Adding some white lighting makes it easier to take a picture but slightly changes the colors you see because nothing is glowing like a black-light poster.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2208px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="PRNWgKP8HrQ4dN4ruLShjL" name="coral-white.jpg" alt="White light photo from Pixel 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRNWgKP8HrQ4dN4ruLShjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2208" height="1241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A white light photo of coral taken with the Pixel 7 Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I do know is that my year-old phone takes photos of a difficult subject as well or better than my expensive "real" camera that doesn&apos;t use voodoo logic and AI in place of a good, fast lens. I wish I had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> here to test because I know it did a lot better than expected while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">taking photos at a public aquarium</a>.</p><p>Phone cameras have moved past the "good enough" metric and are now a real professional tool. It&apos;s something I would have never thought could happen just a few years ago, but I&apos;m ready to put my bigger, heavier camera on the shelf.</p>
