<p>The Oura Ring 4 is the latest and greatest smart ring from the Finnish company that started the wearable craze. However, the Oura Ring Gen 3 was the smart ring that led that trend, thanks to its impressive feature set, battery life, and small size.</p><p>When considering purchasing a smart ring, you&apos;re likely wondering if you should still go for the older Gen 3 or splurge for the newer model. Even if you already own the Oura Ring Gen 3, you may want to know if it&apos;s worth upgrading to the Oura Ring 4 for the extra battery life and other improvements.</p><p>This comparison should help you decide between the two and if it&apos;s worth switching out your Gen 3 for a 4, although the answer isn&apos;t as simple as you may think.</p>
<h2 id="oura-ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-design-2">Oura Ring 4 vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3KjubLK3oYtu4nr2A66MLb" name="Oura-Ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-02.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on the Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3KjubLK3oYtu4nr2A66MLb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> doesn&apos;t look all that different from the Oura Ring Gen 3. The newer model takes after the Horizon style of its predecessor, which features a fully circular design, while the older Heritage style has a flatter "top" section. Where the rings differ, however, is in the materials and the sensors.</p><p>Unlike the Gen 3, which has a titanium exterior and an epoxy interior, the Oura Ring 4 has an all-titanium design, which should improve overall durability. In addition, the sensors are now flush with the interior, whereas the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> has three raised bumps where the sensors go. Having them flush should make the ring more comfortable to wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ukXtzTrmgboYMwWzjeSUaC" name="Oura-Ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-01.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukXtzTrmgboYMwWzjeSUaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4042" height="2274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Heritage style Oura Ring Gen 3 only comes in four different colorways and finishes, the Horizon style has six options, which correspond with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-oura-ring-4-color-should-you-buy">Oura Ring 4 color options</a>. That includes black, silver, Brushed Titanium (Brushed Silver for the Oura Ring 4), Stealth, Gold, and Rose Gold. What you pay for the ring will depend on the color you choose, and for the Gen 3, it will also depend on the style. For comparison, the most expensive Oura Ring 4 colors are $50 cheaper than the most expensive Gen 3 colors, although the cheapest model is $50 more expensive.</p><p>Aside from the all-titanium design, the Oura Ring 4 has the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-oura-ring-4-waterproof">waterproof protection</a>, meaning it should be safe at depths up to 100 meters. The Oura Ring 4 is also available in more sizes than its predecessor, and the width has remained the same, although the thickness lies somewhere between the two Gen 3 styles, while the weight has been reduced overall.</p>

<p>Spec-wise, the Oura Ring 4 is actually pretty similar to the Oura Ring 3, with some differences in battery life, size options, and sensor layout (as well as the specific type of sensors.</p>

<h2 id="oura-ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3-health-tracking-2">Oura Ring 4 vs. Oura Ring Gen 3: Health tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both smart rings feature the standard set of health tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, SpO2, heart rate variability (HRV), temperature, and more. The Oura Ring Gen 3 featured superb health tracking features with the help of its sensor array and algorithms. The ring even supports automatic activity detection, meaning it can detect various activities based on your movements. However, its features are somewhat limited, with automatically tracked activities only showing limited information such as calories.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 improves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">Automatic Activity Detection</a> by including heart rate data when the ring automatically detects certain activities. You&apos;ll get a graph of your heart rate, your average HR, and a view of your heart rate zones while the activity was being detected, useful information for people seeking a more active lifestyle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU" name="Oura-app-activity-heart-rate-details.jpg" alt="Oura app activity tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while the Oura Ring Gen 3 is fairly accurate (although step counting is hit or miss), the Oura Ring 4 should prove more accurate when measuring things like blood oxygen levels. This is thanks to Oura&apos;s new Smart Sensing technology, which takes advantage of the new sensor array on the Oura Ring 4. Instead of static signals, the algorithm can find optimal pathways while on your finger, which can help it remain as accurate as possible, even as the ring shifts around. Oura says this is also aided by the all-titanium build on the new ring, and it has more than double the number of pathways.</p><p>With smart sensing, the Oura Ring 4 should also be able to respond better to people with different finger physiology, meaning users across genders, skin tones, and ages will benefit from better accuracy.</p><p>As a result, the Oura Ring 4 is 30% more accurate with blood oxygen readings than the Oura Ring Gen 3. You&apos;ll also find better heart rate monitoring with fewer gaps throughout the day and overnight.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Truth be told, both smart rings are at the top of their class. The Oura Ring 4 is obviously the better ring, but the Oura Ring Gen 3 is still no pushover, and both devices easily best other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">competing smart rings</a>. That said, if you had to choose between these two, I would recommend buying the Oura Ring 4, and here&apos;s why:</p><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 and has been able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-resilience-metric-tracks-stress-recovery">add plenty of new features</a> to its repertoire, proving that smart rings have the kind of longevity and flexibility that doesn&apos;t require yearly model updates like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a>. However, it&apos;s been a few years already and the Oura Ring Gen 3 is seemingly at the end of the line. Oura says that it will continue to sell the Gen 3 but at a discount, and once stock runs out, that&apos;s it.</p><p>Meanwhile, given what we know about the Gen 3, the newer Oura Ring 4 will likely receive the same treatment, receiving new features while it&apos;s available (and perhaps beyond). So, with the Oura Ring 4 having just launched, this is probably the best time to get one.</p>
<p>However, it&apos;s a little different if you already <em>have</em> the Gen 3. Oura doesn&apos;t offer any upgrade perks or discounts, so there&apos;s no real pathway to "upgrade" your ring besides outright buying a new one. And while that may seem tempting (if you have the money, go for it), you&apos;re probably best sticking with the Gen 3 until it completely dies.</p>

Google showcased dozens of new features in the beta testing phase, but like previous years, not all features made it to the stable build. Either they&apos;re not fully ready, or Google decided to hold back features until later releases.</p><p>This was the case with the predictive back gesture, which showed up initially in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> beta but is only rolling out widely with Android 15. While Android 16 is still a few months away — the initial preview builds should go live at the end of February 2025 — we know a decent amount about the next version of Android.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="usUCsFE8ymUB2rjF9HTzYo" name="android-15-devices-2.jpg" alt="List of devices getting Android 15 beta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usUCsFE8ymUB2rjF9HTzYo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 16 will make its way to more devices than just about any other Android version. With most brands now offering at least three Android OS updates to their budget and mid-range phones, Android 16 will be available to most devices launched in the last two years. Budget phones have been ignored for far too long, and the fact that they will get long-term updates is a big deal.</p><p>When it comes to Google&apos;s own devices, all Pixels starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7</a> series will be able to switch to Android 16. That leaves out the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and all older Pixels, but these devices will continue to get feature updates and security patches. With Google now guaranteeing seven years of software updates — even on the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> — updates aren&apos;t going to be a problem in the future.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-android-16-s-internal-codename"><span>What is Android 16's internal codename?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google used dessert names with Android versions in the past, and while it doesn&apos;t do so any longer — that ended with Android 10 — it still maintains internal codenames. Android 15 was Vanilla Ice Cream, and with Android 16, you&apos;d assume Google to go with a dessert that starts with the letter W, like waffle.</p><p>Instead, Android 16 has an internal codename dubbed Baklava. Google is changing how it&apos;s assigning the codenames for Android releases, and while it&apos;s still maintaining dessert-based monikers, it effectively started over.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-new-features-coming-to-android-16"><span>New features coming to Android 16</span></h3>
<h2 id="notification-cooldown-turns-down-the-noise-2">Notification cooldown turns down the noise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg" name="android-15-notifications.jpg" alt="Android 15 notification cooldown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notification cooldown is a great new feature that lowers the volume of incoming notifications when you get successive notifications from within the same app. So if you&apos;re in a group chat and start getting constant notifications, your phone automatically lowers the volume of subsequent notifications. </p><p>What&apos;s great is that you can select this setting for just conversations, or all apps. As someone who doesn&apos;t like getting many notification alerts (I use DND most of the day), this is a great new addition, and one that I will use to good effect.</p>
<h2 id="an-actual-desktop-mode-2">An actual desktop mode</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-desktop.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on desk in DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">DeX mode</a> on its high-end devices, but the brand is an outlier in this regard, and most Android devices don&apos;t have a desktop mode. That may change with Android 16; later Android 15 beta builds had a desktop mode with app windows, and while it isn&apos;t available in the stable build, it&apos;s clear that Google is working on enabling a desktop mode in Android.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s feature is still much better; the brand has been tweaking DeX for nearly half a decade now, and it is a mature platform. That said, I&apos;m very excited to see a native desktop mode make its way to Android 16.</p>
<h2 id="limit-charging-to-80-2">Limit charging to 80%</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m" name="battery-settings-on-pixel-9-pro-xl.jpg" alt="Battery screen on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This feature was available in the Android 15 beta, but there&apos;s no mention of it in the stable release. The charging optimization mode is in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">Android 15 QPR1 build</a>, so Google will likely roll it out with that update, or push it to the wider Android 16 release.</p><p>As the name suggests, the feature allows you to limit the battery to 80%, prolonging its longevity considerably. While a few manufacturers have this feature in their own skin, it makes to see it baked into Android natively.</p>
<h2 id="audio-sharing-should-be-easier-in-android-16-2">Audio sharing should be easier in Android 16</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="urcipt6frvrTMcHqmQjckW" name="nothing-ear-2-25.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (2) earbuds review on red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urcipt6frvrTMcHqmQjckW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new feature that showed up in initial Android 15 betas but isn&apos;t available in the stable release is the ability to cast music to several Bluetooth devices at the same time. The Audio sharing sub-menu is located within the Connected devices page, and it lets you cast music to more than one Bluetooth device at a time. I really wanted to see this feature in Android 15, but given how buggy it was, it&apos;s clear that Google is pushing it to next year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-16-is-coming-soon"><span>Android 16 is coming soon</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn" name="android-14-pixel-9-pro-xl-android-15-pixel-9-pro-fold-2.jpg" alt="Android 14 on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Android 15 on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMKzfoCA9KYCgfxHqqEUJn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don&apos;t have to wait too long to get an initial preview into Android 16. Google usually rolls out a dev preview in Q1, and while the early builds are buggy and don&apos;t have much in the way of new features, they act as the foundation for further testing.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t changed its beta program in nearly a decade, and that&apos;s unlikely to be the case next year. That means we should get the public beta builds around May, with a stable release in Q4. Of course, this is all conjecture at this point, and we will know more once Google starts rolling out preview builds of Android 16.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Motorola revealed a new AI concept that allows your phone to understand its surroundings and tackle tasks just by having a casual chat.</li><li>Although it's still in the proof-of-concept stage, this technology could learn from your habits and turn natural language into actions, making it feel like you have a personal assistant.</li><li>Motorola is also enhancing other AI features, like Moto AI, which launched with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and is gradually expanding in beta testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today at Lenovo&apos;s Tech World 2024 event, Motorola showcased a new AI-powered concept that could turn your phone into a do-it-all device.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-at-tech-world-2024/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it&apos;s exploring a new project that combines Large Action Models (LAM) with Moto AI’s smarts. This proof-of-concept tech lets your phone pick up on your environment and handle tricky tasks by just chatting with it naturally.</p><p>The company gives a simple example: say, "order me an iced americano," and Moto AI will find a nearby coffee shop, place the order, and let you know when it’s ready. This same feature can also handle your regular tasks like hailing a ride.</p><p>While it’s still in the proof-of-concept phase, this tech could understand your environment, learn from your habits to give personalized responses, and turn natural language into actions all on its own. Essentially, Motorola&apos;s LAMs are like smart assistants that can interact with you in a human-like way using everyday language.</p><p>These features give Motorola&apos;s concept a unique twist compared to Apple and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s AI tools</a>. The LAM technology aims to take action in response to your requests instead of just spitting out text or images.</p><p>On the other hand, Google’s upgraded Gemini digital assistant can handle questions about what’s on your screen and interact with other apps.</p><p>Even though this technology is only a proof of concept for now, Motorola is also pushing forward with other AI-driven features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-could-pack-a-game-changing-camera-upgrade">Moto AI</a>, launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> earlier this year, is gradually expanding its AI features in a beta testing phase.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the company showcased several Moto AI features, including Catch Me Up and Remember This. The Catch Me Up feature helps you quickly catch up on notifications by giving you a prioritized summary, saving you from having to scroll through a long list of missed alerts.</p><p>The Pay Attention feature makes it easy for users to keep track of instructions without having to write them down or record lengthy audio notes. Meanwhile, Remember This lets you save live moments or on-screen info when activated.</p><p>However, there’s no word yet on which devices are included in this beta testing or how participants are chosen. Motorola plans to gradually roll out beta invitations over the year.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Google Pixel deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for. If you prefer to buy unlocked phones, you&apos;ll find that retailers like Amazon and Best Buy are more than willing to discount Pixel devices heavily during sale events. </p><p>If you&apos;re okay with making a change to your wireless service or you have a device to trade in, you can expect many carriers to discount their Pixel stock as well. As a matter of fact, there are already plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> available for the Google Pixel 9 series at this exact moment. </p><p>Last but not least, if you don&apos;t mind a preowned item, Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend typically presents a unique opportunity to buy refurbished tech on sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.backmarket.com/"><strong>BackMarket.com</strong></a>. These devices have been tested and renewed to meet like-new standards, and all items from BackMarket are supported by a one-year warranty. Of course, mileage with refurbished phones may vary, but the site is worth a look while you&apos;re shopping.  </p>

<h2 id="when-do-black-friday-phone-deals-start-2">When do Black Friday phone deals start?</h2>
<p>Black Friday deals are actually starting to kick off right now, and the best offers will continue to run through November 29th. That being said, the offers on display will continue to get better as we approach the holiday, so keep checking this guide as I add new Pixel discounts. </p>
<h2 id="what-black-friday-google-pixel-deals-can-i-expect-2">What Black Friday Google Pixel deals can I expect?</h2>
<p>Fortunately, Amazon&apos;s recent Prime Day event gives us a good idea of what we can expect as the Black Friday deals go live. During that 48-hour sale, we saw a ton of last-gen Pixel phones score record-breaking discounts, while Google tablets and smartwatches saw similarly tempting price drops. We didn&apos;t see any major discounts on the Pixel 9 series or the Google Pixel Watch 3, however, but that could change by the time Black Friday weekend rolls around. </p>

<p>We once considered the Pixel 7 Pro to be the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> on the market, and while it's since been supplanted by newer devices, the Pro continues to hold its own in 2024 with outstanding cameras, an efficient Tensor G2 processor, and a large battery that easily lasts a day on a single charge. Buy the phone from Best Buy and activate through your carrier today and you'll enjoy a $450 discount. If you'd rather buy unlocked, you'll still be eligible to receive a sweet $350 off the Pixel 7 Pro. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-7-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6519915.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="02483b5e-ab1c-43d6-acea-87b32f99aad8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$899" data-dimension48="$899">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Some Xfinity by Comcast customers experienced severe internet outages across the United States on Tuesday. While not every customer has been affected, we&apos;ve heard reports of lost or slow internet in many major U.S. hubs.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/xfinity/" target="_blank">Downdetector</a> shows a spike in reports in the last hour, with 68% reporting "landline internet" issues. Some Android Central staffers have personally been affected, reporting problems with their home internet and cable TV; others still have internet and only experienced a brief outage earlier in the day. It may vary by location.</p>

<p>Android Central reached out to Comcast asking for comment on the source of the outage and the timetable for when things will be fixed, as no Xfinity social media has commented on the outage. </p><p><strong>Update: </strong>An Xfinity rep told us that their team is "not seeing" an issue, though it&apos;s possible that the widespread issue was resolved before they <em>could</em> see anything. </p><p>It appears that things have improved since the initial spike in reports, but we&apos;re still seeing reports coming in on Down Detector — simply fewer than before. Some users have told us that their cable has returned but home internet is still down.</p><p>While we&apos;re grateful that the Xfinity issues didn&apos;t last long in most places, we&apos;re curious why they cropped up in the first place, and wish we could have gotten more information on the source of the problem.

<ul><li>Amazon's 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite allegedly leaked as images of its retail box surfaced online.</li><li>The box shows the tablet could grab a slightly larger 7-inch display and 16GB of internal storage with "weeks" of battery life.</li><li>The supposed upgrades are minimalistic at best as other options like Kobo's new color e-readers and the Onyx Boox turn heads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon might have a next-gen Paperwhite tablet on the way as it seemingly leaks unceremoniously.</p><p>The rumor stems from a retail worker who supposedly got their hands on the retail box for Amazon&apos;s 12th-Gen Kindle Paperwhite. As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2024-got-leaked">Good E Reader</a>, the images don&apos;t excite as the most notable change is its alleged 7-inch display. The back of the box adds the device could feature an "adjustable warm light," an IPX8 2M waterproof rating, and "weeks" of battery life.</p><p>The front of the box suggests the 12th-Gen Paperwhite will offer 16GB of internal storage.</p><p>The design of this alleged next-gen reading tablet mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-review">11th-gen Paperwhite</a> from 2021. The device still features quite thick bezels around its entirety, not to mention the rather pronounced chin with the Kindle name. Small differences in its form factor are expected as the display increases (slightly) from 6.8 inches to the rumored seven.</p><p>What&apos;s not clear is whether this is the only 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite we&apos;re getting or if there&apos;s a Signature Edition on the way. The publication stated that a next-gen Signature Edition model could add features like page-turn buttons and an e-paper display. However, it&apos;s too early to tell as it&apos;s unclear when this leaked model will arrive.</p><p>But the existence of its retail box could indicate we&apos;re approaching such a launch date.</p>

<p>When Amazon launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-unveils-new-kindle-paperwhite-e-readers-signature-and-kids-editions">its trio of Paperwhites</a> in 2021, the company noted its 10% brighter display. More importantly, the battery life of those older tablets sat at around 10 weeks. This meant users would have to charge their Paperwhites (roughly) once every two and a half months. This was paired with a 9W charger that took around 2.5 hours to complete a full charging cycle.</p><p>If these images are to be believed, perhaps we should look elsewhere for more changes. It would be nice if Amazon could improve the tablet&apos;s charging capabilities with more strength to quicken its cycle.</p><p>But, the kicker is that Amazon could risk falling behind other, more popular e-readers that are doing more. Earlier this year, Kobo launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-and-kobo-clara-colour-ereaders-announced">first color e-readers</a>: the Libra Colour and the Clara Colour. Those devices offer a 7-inch display with 32GB of storage and richer saturation with a palette of 4,096 colors.</p><p>There&apos;s also the Onyx Boox, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/buy-a-boox-on-black-friday">is turning heads</a> over Amazon&apos;s options.</p>

I&apos;ve even mentioned it to Google because I thought it was so important!</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure it didn&apos;t happen because I asked for it, but you can now lock down your phone by entering its phone number on a simple web page. Visit Android.com/lock and everything you need is right there, without fiddling with passkeys, two-factor codes, or anything else.</p>
<p>Getting those codes or having access to a passkey can be difficult if your phone isn&apos;t in your hand, and you will probably need one or the other if you want to sign in to something else so you can try and lockdown or find a lost phone. Now you won&apos;t need to.</p><p>You unlock it the same way you unlock your phone any other time using the normal lock screen; this isn&apos;t some super hardened device lock or anything. Think of it the same as using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-lockdown-mode-and-why-would-you-need-it">Lockdown Mode</a>. It will make it a lot more difficult for someone to get on your phone and open up your Bank app or CashApp, though.</p>

<p>We really shouldn&apos;t need this.

Set it so your phone locks after 15 or 30 seconds of not being used and you&apos;re almost always good.</p><p>But many people spend time finding ways to keep their phones from locking itself. There are apps and tools—even tools from Google—that can keep your phone unlocked if it&apos;s close to a Bluetooth device, in range of a certain place, or comes in contact with the right NFC tag.</p>
<p>That&apos;s great as long as you don&apos;t lose your phone and it can still do one of those things. It&apos;s not so great if someone steals your phone and your smartwatch or you lose your phone in the apartment building you live in.</p><p>Don&apos;t think it can&apos;t happen, because it does. Maybe you&apos;re at a party in the common area of your building and lose your phone. Maybe you get robbed and the crook also takes your watch. Or maybe you&apos;re using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Trusted Devices</a> feature and lose your phone at an Android event with a few thousand people and hope it&apos;s not close enough to work, which happened to me in Texas a while back.</p>

<p>No matter why you might need to quickly lock your phone down, you finally can. You could do it from any public computer, from a friend&apos;s laptop, or even from someone else&apos;s phone. All you need is to know your phone number and be able to visit a web page.</p><p>Finding it may be a little harder because you&apos;ll need to sign into your Google account, but at least you know that nobody is getting into your stuff until you do. Simple tools that make it easy to protect your information are the best tools. It&apos;s nice to see one like this from Google.</p>

<p>Oppo has already announced that it will launch several products on October 24, including the much-awaited Find X8 series, Enco X3 Buds, Pad 3 Pro, and Watch X. Ahead of the launch, Evan Blass has provided renders of some of the aforementioned devices.</p><p>As always, the tipster has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845932101838725339">shared</a> all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845930735041237101">images</a> of the said devices on X, including the color variants, which give us a clear picture of what to expect. While Oppo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5089392546808104">already teased</a> these products (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_pad_3_pro_set_to_launch_alongside_find_x8_series_-news-64921.php">GSMArena</a>), the images from Blass help us explore those devices in detail since they&apos;re official renders.</p>

<p>The Find X8 and the Find X8 Pro share similar design aesthetics as well as color variants that include shades of silver, rose gold, blue, and regular black/gray. While the vanilla variant has more rounded corners, the Pro model appears taller with slightly fewer rounded corners. Regardless, both Oppo phones carry narrow bezels from the front compared to the predecessor models.</p><p>Further, both upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> share a giant circular module at the back, which incorporates at least four lenses, including a periscopic lens on the Pro model.</p>

<p>The anticipation around the Find X8 series has been quite significant in the past few weeks, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-series-to-sport-narrow-bezels">has teased</a> the handsets as its direct take on Apple&apos;s iPhone 16 series. So much so that both phones not only feature narrower bezels than the iPhone 16/16 Pro models, but they even carry the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">Camera Control</a> button for the first time.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OB4SEtVA2">Zhou Yibao on Weibo</a> has even shared the button in action with the phone submerged under water. Alongside the design, this unique feature might be one of the standout features for the Find X8 series when it launches next week. The latest renders also corroborate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">leaked hands-on images</a> of the Find X8, which surfaced early this month.</p>

<p>Returning to the renders, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845933160866988246">Oppo Pad 3 Pro</a> follows in the lot, which looks identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/001RJIkpgy1hulxwuqnpjj60u01hcqv502.jpg">has already teased</a> that it would be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC—the processor powers some of the best Android phones. </p><p>The renders show that it again has a sole rear camera. At the same time, the front has sizable bezels like the company&apos;s previous tablets. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> is also expected to come in at least two color shades this year.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1845934788454023421">Oppo Enco X3 renders</a> look precisely like the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3 Pro</a>, which turned out to be excellent wireless earbuds from the company. Aside from the brand&apos;s name engraving, the shared renders of the Enco X3 look identical to the OnePlus buds—including color variants.</p>

<h2 id="some-information-about-the-oura-ring-4-apos-s-battery-life-and-how-you-can-make-it-even-better-2">Some information about the Oura Ring 4&apos;s battery life, and how you can make it even better</h2>
<p>Smart rings seem to be the next big thing in the world of wearable technology, with several new players making their presence felt in the segment. That being said, Oura continues to be the most well-known brand in this space, and the Finnish company&apos;s newest product — the Oura Ring 4 — looks poised to strengthen that position further.</p><p>Made fully from titanium, the Oura Ring 4 features a refreshed design with recessed sensors, which should allow for increased comfort and better accuracy. Speaking of which, the wearable comes with &apos;Smart Sensing&apos; technology that works alongside an improved algorithm to continuously record a plethora of health & wellness metrics.</p><p>Of course, all these advanced sensors require power, and the Oura Ring 4 has that in abundance. According to Oura&apos;s claims, the smart ring can go up to eight days with a fully charged battery. This is something we&apos;ll only be able to test out when we review this thing, but given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review" target="_blank">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> impressed Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee with its solid battery life, we have high hopes for the latest-generation wearable.</p>

<p>As is the case with any modern gadget, the actual battery endurance of Oura Ring 4 is going to depend on individual use and other factors like ring size, activities logged, and more. Oura recommends following a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046218953-Ring-Battery-Tips" target="_blank">tips and tricks</a> to get the most out of the smart ring&apos;s battery life, and some of them are mentioned below:</p>
<ul><li>Keep the wearable's firmware updated to the latest version. This can be done via the companion app, and the smart ring must have over 30 percent juice left in the tank.</li><li>Charge the battery to at least 30 percent before going to bed.</li><li>Enable Airplane Mode and low battery notifications.</li></ul>
<p>With its premium build quality, industry-leading activity tracking hardware, and great battery life, the Oura Ring 4 is all but certain to take over the crown of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings" target="_blank">best smart ring</a> from its predecessor. It&apos;s comfortable enough to be worn at all times, features a laundry list of sensors, and is available in a wide range of sizes and finishes. Having a starting price of $349, it doesn&apos;t come cheap, but if you want a stylish and feature-packed activity tracker for your finger, this one is definitely worth checking out.</p>

<hr>
<p>A small but mighty change may be coming to the Google Play Store: the "Install" button could soon stay at the top of app pages, so you can grab an app without scrolling back up to find it.</p><p>For Android users, the Google Play Store is like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">treasure trove of apps and games</a>. But sometimes, those long app descriptions can hide the Install button, forcing you to scroll back up. It can be a real hassle when you&apos;re just trying to grab something quickly.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-store-fixed-header-install-button-apk-teardown-3490075/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Google Play Store version 43.1.19 has some code that hints at a new feature where the Install button will stick at the top of the page while you scroll through app details. If this pans out, this update means you won’t have to go back to the top to start installing, even for apps with super long descriptions.</p><p>Reverse engineering expert AssembleDebug managed to activate this feature for Android Authority and even shared a video showing how it works.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ_sl7vxfvk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>A quick look at the video highlights the benefits of having the Install button always visible. With it, users can dive into app details before hitting install, making sure they make informed choices.</p><p>The fixed header will feature essential details about an app, including its icon, name, developer, average Play Store rating, and whether it has ads. There&apos;ll also be a dropdown menu for installing the app on other devices.</p><p>While this change might seem small, it could give app developers a big boost. This feature makes things a lot easier and is likely to lead to more app downloads.</p><p>Detailed app store listings are great for informing users, but they can unintentionally hurt developers trying to provide all that info. With the Install button stuck at the top, the chances of users leaving the page without scrolling back up to install increase every time they scroll down.</p><p>Keep in mind that this feature isn’t live on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a> yet, but it’s expected to be available to users soon—though there’s no guarantee on when that will happen.</p>
