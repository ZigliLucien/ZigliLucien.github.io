<ul><li>Google's latest Gemini app beta version contains signs of a new "drag and drop" feature in development for Android.</li><li>The feature would let users make a copy of Gemini's initial pop-up window to then place at the top of their display for split-screen use.</li><li>Google recently brought Gemini in Messages to more Android devices following Pixel and Galaxy phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A find in Gemini&apos;s code on Android shows Google&apos;s apparent interest in boosting its abilities, by offering a split screen addition.</p><p>A dive into the Gemini app on Android&apos;s latest beta version by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-multi-window-mode-3456690/">Android Authority</a> showcases a feature that lets users split the AI&apos;s initial pop-up window. It&apos;s unclear when this will roll out. However, version 15.26.34 shows that users can "drag and drop" a new window by long-pressing the pop-up&apos;s handle.</p><p>This window is produced by swiping up from the bottom right of Android&apos;s UI.</p><p>After enabling the appropriate flag, long-pressing the handle copies Gemini&apos;s initial window before displaying Android&apos;s typical, vertical split screen view on phones. The beta shows that the second window appears as a more compact version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">main Gemini app</a> with your Google account icon visible, alongside some suggested queries and the pill-shaped text box.</p><p>The original window remains at the bottom with the same design that Android users are used to seeing when producing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> through its swipe command. In testing, the publication states that users can converse with Gemini in both windows without issue.</p><p>Dragging the bottom window up by its handle will remove the cloned copy and vice versa.</p><p>While the beta&apos;s code shows Gemini&apos;s cloned pop-up window on a phone&apos;s split view, it seems likely that this will arrive for tablets, too. It also seems like this won&apos;t be Google Pixel exclusive, as a string referencing Samsung was found for this "drag and drop" feature.</p>

<p>In June, Google finally started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-finally-available-for-more-android-phones-in-messages">AI Gemini for Messages</a> on more phones. Devices with 6GB of RAM or more can utilize the software&apos;s abilities, such as drafting text messages or asking questions about any topic. Conversating with Gemini in Messages will create its own thread for easy rediscovery. For a while, the AI was only available in Messages for Pixel and Galaxy devices.</p><p>Google highlighted its work to bring Gemini&apos;s AI smarts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">the school system</a> by incorporating teen student accounts and tools for teachers. Students will soon be able to ask Gemini questions; however, the company states that guardrails are in place to ensure a child&apos;s safety.</p><p>Tools for teachers involve a bolstered Read Along in Classrooms and the ability to assign reading material to students based on their reading data.</p>

<ul><li>Recent speculation states Samsung could move away from the Plus model when it launches the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The theory comes from a database listing, which oddly lacks a model number that could point toward the Plus model.</li><li>However, a discovery quickly refuted this theory, stating Samsung has internal codenames for all three devices, including the model number for the S25 Plus.</li><li>Samsung's S24 Plus was a massive success this year as users were given that "sweet spot" with its QHD+ display and more RAM for a better price point.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we await Samsung&apos;s 2024 summer event, a new theory suggests its next flagship phone line could drop a key member.</p><p>A database discovery by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/07/exclusive-samsung-makes-radical-change-with-galaxy-s25-series-no-more-plus-model.html">Android Headlines</a> showed that Samsung might only have plans for two S25 devices. From the listing, a device was discovered with model number SM-S931B/DS, which is supposedly the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">S25 model</a>. Another device was found with the following number: SM-S938B. This same model was available several more times with varying end tags such as "U" and "N."</p><p>It was explained that the letters signify the region of its debut, with "B" representing the global market, "U" for the U.S., and "N" for South Korea.</p><p>Although this theoretical lack of a Galaxy S25 Plus seems extremely unlikely, the post states that it could be a strategic move by Samsung. The publication also adds that the specifications of the Plus and base models have moved closer over the years.</p><p>Speculation suggests the company is more focused on pushing its Ultra version over a boosted base model.</p><p>However, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25/">GalaxyClub</a> discovered that Samsung&apos;s development of all <em>three </em>S25 models is proceeding (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-model-not-cancelled/">SamMobile</a>). The Dutch publication found evidence of three internal codenames: F1, F2, and F3, which reportedly refer to the S25, S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra. Additionally, the Plus model bears model number SM-S936, filling the gap between the other two devices.</p>

<p>It would be odd if Samsung dropped its middle device following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">the success of the Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Shortly after its January launch, early sales analytics for the device showed that the S24 Plus was more popular than its 2023 counterpart, achieving a 54% increase in revenue.</p><p>The middle Plus sibling is typically a slightly boosted base model, though this year&apos;s version brought QHD+ resolution for its large display. The S24 Plus also boasts 12GB of RAM to complement its suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. Moreover, Minsoo Kang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, stated that the S24 Plus was Samsung&apos;s "big driver" in 2024. Kang added, "it&apos;s hitting the sweet spot on pricing, nudging upgraders as well as specs to support new users wanting optimized on-device AI."</p><p>Other early rumors about the device suggest Samsung could drop Exynos and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon</a> SoC on its S25 series in all regions.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-design-changes-rumor">a report from South Korea</a> highlighted the chance for a slightly larger S25 display at 6.3 inches. The post added that "overall" design changes could land in the upcoming series, as well.</p>

<ul><li>A batch of alleged promotional material-like imagery for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 leaked on X, showcasing the phone in a blue colorway.</li><li>The images seemingly clue us into Samsung's Flip 6 segment of the device's health data, sleep information, and cover display clock face.</li><li>Samsung confirmed that its Unpacked event will take place on July 10.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another batch of leaked Flip 6 material shows Samsung&apos;s next clamshell with its supposed event designs.</p><p>The latest leaks stem from X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1808377808193786053">Evan Blass</a>, who posted a set of four images of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in a blue colorway. It&apos;s been evident for a while now that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">keep the design the same</a>, and these leaks continue that trend. The first of the four shows the device up close with its blue-accented dual camera array, and the cover display&apos;s rather thick side bezels.</p><p>Blass added two more photos, which might&apos;ve spilled Samsung&apos;s health-focused segment of the Flip 6&apos;s reveal. The photos tease the device&apos;s health and fitness data, such as steps walked, workout minutes, calories burned, and an example of a night&apos;s rest.</p><p>Another image purports the phone&apos;s "lock screen" on the cover. Samsung may show the device with different, stylized numbers for its stacked clock on either side of the screen. Then, Blass showed an image of the Flip 6 in its Flex Mode, capable of being placed at a 90-degree angle for photos, video calls, and more.</p><p>One final photo highlighted the Flip 6&apos;s small form factor when folded, while also focusing on its hinge.</p>

<p>The hype continues to mount for the next Flip, which recently had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/overseas-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-listing-color-leak">several of its colorways</a> leaked by an overseas source. The supposed renders showcased the phone in green (mint), gray, light blue, and yellow options. There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">another rumor</a> that said the Flip 6 could grab exclusive online store colors, such as white and black, alongside a new "Peach" hue.</p><p>One area that the Flip 6 could improve over its predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-leak-hints-at-a-bigger-battery-and-improved-camera">is its battery</a>. Rumors claim Samsung could pack a 4,000mAh battery into the device, increasing its capacity from 3,700mAh. This could be joined by a stronger 50MP primary sensor, as well. Moreover, consumers may still find a 256GB and a 512GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-storage-color-options-leak">storage option</a> for the clamshell once it launches.</p><p>The whispers won&apos;t be around for much longer as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Samsung confirmed</a> that its next Unpacked event will occur on July 10 in Paris, France. Interested parties can snag $50 from the company as its Galaxy device reserve program continues.</p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming Pixel 9 in Pink shows up in a new video ahead of its official launch.</li><li>The new hands-on video also showcases the display of the Pixel 9 next to the device from all angles.</li><li>The official launch of the Pixel 9 series is set for August 13 through Made by Google event.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After witnessing a Pink Pixel 9 in a set of images and a hands-on video on Tuesday (July 2), another video surfaced on the web, giving the audience a closer look at the upcoming flagship.</p><p>While the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">leaked hands-on video</a> showcased the device from all angles, it didn&apos;t show it with its screen turned on. The latest one, shared by a user with the username "Reparation Mobile 23" on Facebook (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel9-9-leak-screen-on-3456648/">Android Authority</a>), reveals the screen in action to some extent. </p><p>It doesn&apos;t drastically differ from the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series, as it still has a conventional punch-hole screen and a flat display. The interface on the inside looks unchanged, too.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pixel-9-leaked-video.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pixel-9-leaked-video.mp4"></video></div>
<p>The device is shown in all possible angles, aside from the screen. At the bottom, the Pixel 9 has a single speaker grille, USB Type-C, and a SIM card slot, while the volume rockers and the home button are on the side pane. </p><p>The dual cameras are seen inside the camera visor, which is accompanied by an LED flash. The visor sports a matte finish, and the back appears glossy, similar to the previous hands-on video.</p><p>Aside from the all-new pink color and aforementioned details, nothing concrete is there to comprehend. The leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">high-quality renders</a> of the Pixel 9 and its siblings have given us a fairly clear picture of what to expect at the Made by Google event. </p>
<p>Regardless, it is still a major leak, given that the launch is still a month away. The previous leak also indicated that the device is already available in the Algerian market. </p><p>Along with the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro and an all-new Pixel 9 Pro XL model will likely debut at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made By Google event</a> on August 13. Next to the Pixel phones, the Pixel Watch 3 and the new generation of Pixel Buds are the other expected devices from Google. With this major hands-on leak, we expect similar significant leaks to pop up as we march toward the Pixel launch event.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-how-much-water-your-motorola-razr-2024-can-resist-2">This is how much water your Motorola Razr 2024 can resist</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re considering getting the Razr 2024, these words will usually come to mind: is the Razr 2024 waterproof? Fortunately, the new Motorola is waterproof. But unfortunately, it lacks protection from dust. The Motorola Razr 2024 features an IP (ingress protection) rating of IPX8, which indicates that you can drop it in fresh water as deep as 1.5 meters for as long as 30 minutes without suffering water damage. This rating is given by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which tells users how much water their device can withstand. So, the phone should be OK if you ever get caught in a rainstorm or drop it in the bathtub.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-vs-razr-2023">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Razr 2024</a> comparison also revealed the same IP rating for both phones. However, testing was done in a lab with fresh water, not the highly chlorinated water found in pools or seawater. You should also avoid liquids such as sugary juices and soft drinks since they could cause permanent damage. It&apos;s also a good idea to be careful with liquids such as alcohol and soap.</p><p>The X in the IPX8 rating means it did not undergo testing for dust resistance. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it has no dust resistance, but the device did not undergo testing. However, if there were a zero instead of an X, it would have no resistance to dust particles. A six indicates it&apos;s sealed tight against dust for up to eight hours. If you go somewhere with a lot of dust in the air, it&apos;s best to keep your phone in a dust-proof pouch to prevent any possible damage.</p>

<p>The second number reveals how resistant the device is to water, with nine being the highest rating possible and zero being the lowest. A smartphone with a military-grade IP69K rating (the highest rating possible) would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/blackview-bl8800-pro-review">Blackview BL8800 Pro</a>, which can withstand high-pressure water jets and dust, which you find in equipment for food processing and pharmaceutical applications.</p><p>You can help extend your phone&apos;s IP rating by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-and-disinfect-your-android-smartphone">cleaning it well</a> if you see dust on it or drying it with a microfiber cloth if it&apos;s wet. Your phone will not always have the IPX8 rating since it can deteriorate over time, even more so when it&apos;s not handled correctly and frequently drops. High humidity and extreme temperatures will also decrease the rating over time. Therefore, the older your phone is, the more cautious you should be around water and dusty areas.</p><p>It&apos;s also best to avoid making any modifications to the phone, such as changing the display without talking to an authorized handler, since this can void your warranty and damage the IPX8 rating.</p><p>The highest common rating for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, is an IP68 rating, which means it&apos;s dust-tight against solid particles (6) and waterproof for a depth of 1.5 meters and 30 minutes (8).</p>

You may not have time to learn the language&apos;s grammar, but thanks to Gboard&apos;s ability to translate as you type, you don&apos;t have to.</p><p>There are various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard tips and tricks</a> for getting the most out of Gboard, but the translate feature is a real-time saver. You can switch from a long list of language options, which is a huge help when learning a new language. It doesn&apos;t work like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate</a> feature you would find in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but still a great tool to have around.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-google-translate-on-gboard-2">How to enable Google Translate on Gboard</h2>
<p>You can use Gboard translate on any app where you can type. If you haven&apos;t done so, you&apos;ll need to install Gboard on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Android phone</a> and make it your default keyboard. If the app doesn&apos;t show you an option to make it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-default-keyboard-your-android-phone">your default keyboard</a>, you can do so by following these steps:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>System</strong> option.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Language & input</strong>.</p><p>4. Select the <strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> option.</p><p>4. Toggle on <strong>Gboard.</strong></p><p>Ensure that Gboard is toggled on. Then, you can easily switch it by tapping the keyboard icon at the bottom right of your display. The steps could be different depending on the model of your Android smartphone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.89%;"><img id="NvsxdrJtc79tSurY5CCQMP" name="Switching-keyboards-An.png" alt="The keyboard icon at the bottom right of display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvsxdrJtc79tSurY5CCQMP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="338" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you have Gboard as your default keyboard, open an app where you can type a message, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. Once you&apos;re ready to type:</p><p>1. Tap the <strong>Translate button</strong> at the top of the keyboard. If you don&apos;t see it, tap the icon that looks like four tiny squares together and tap the translate option. You can drag it to the top for faster access.</p><p>2. <strong>Choose the languages</strong> you want to translate from and to at the top. The languages above the line indicate the language packs you&apos;ve downloaded. If you don&apos;t see the language, you must swipe up and select your preferred language.</p><p>You&apos;ll see two arrows between the languages, which allow you to switch between them. For example, tap the arrows if you&apos;re translating from English to French and want to switch from French to English.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:675px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.11%;"><img id="bpx7kgzhGFmP27o6Fz5GvB" name="Choose-language-Gboard.jpg" alt="Choosing a language to translate from and to on Gboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bpx7kgzhGFmP27o6Fz5GvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="675" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. At the bottom, <strong>type in the language</strong> you want to translate from, and you&apos;ll see the translated text at the top. Even if you erase one word, that word will also be erased at the top in the translated text bar.</p><p>If you don&apos;t feel like typing, you can use voice-to-text for faster results. To do so, tap the mic icon on the keyboard&apos;s right. If you don&apos;t see it, tap Gboard&apos;s cogwheel to access <strong>Settings</strong>, choose <strong>Voice typing</strong>, and ensure that it&apos;s <strong>toggled on</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-apps-up-to-date-2">Keep your apps up to date</h2>
<p>Keep your apps updated to ensure that Gboard runs smoothly and you always get the latest updates on the keyboard. Even if you have it set so your apps are updated automatically, manually check for any pending updates. To check for updates, do the following:</p><p>1. Opening <strong>Google Play</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Manage apps & device</strong>.</p><p>4. Check under <strong>Updates available</strong>.</p><p>If you&apos;re worried about storage space, you can only update the Gboard app and leave the others for later. You can also tap the Update All button to update your apps.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-if-gboard-apos-s-translate-as-you-type-feature-is-not-working-2">What to do if Gboard&apos;s translate as you type feature is not working</h2>
<p>Like any other app, Gboard may fail to translate as you type occasionally, and there could be various reasons why. Ensure you have a good Internet connection and your Wi-Fi signal isn&apos;t so weak that it affects how it works. You can also try restarting your phone for a fresh start and ensuring you have all your apps up to date. It could also not be your fault and the error could be on Google&apos;s side, in that case, the best thing you can do is wait it out and try later.</p>
<h2 id="keep-on-translating-2">Keep on translating</h2>
<p>Gboard&apos;s translate as you type feature is a great tool when you&apos;re learning a new language and need some help expressing your ideas. It won&apos;t always get the grammar part of the language right. For example, if you want to say something to a female friend, Gboard translates it as intended for a male friend in some languages with gendered pronouns. These errors can be embarrassing, but hopefully, this will be corrected soon.</p><p>The feature works on older Android phones as well as new ones, especially newer flagship phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>. You may not use it as much on newer phones since they come with features such as Live Translate, but it&apos;s good to know it&apos;s there if you ever need it.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel phones receive the latest July system update following the Pixel Watch models.</li><li>The update includes phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to Pixel 8a, as well as Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.</li><li>Google has also addressed the recent factory reset issue on Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and 6a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After rolling out the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-july-2024-update"> July update </a>to the Pixel Watch just a few days ago, Google is now bringing the monthly software update to Pixel phones powered by Android 14.</p><p>Pixel phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> alongside the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet will receive the latest security patch from Google, the company notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/283199250/google-pixel-update-july-2024?hl=en&sjid=12145797219137462659-AP">accompanying support post</a>. </p><p>The July update carries bug fixes and improvements. Per the changelog, general improvements for camera stability "under certain conditions" can be seen on devices including Pixel 5a (5G), Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.</p>
<p>Similarly, the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> models show general system stability and performance improvements in certain conditions. Lastly, a user interface bug fix is coming for Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a, which addresses the back gesture navigation issue that wasn&apos;t working in certain scenarios.</p><p>The system update bearing the <strong>AP2A.240705.004 </strong>version will be rolled out globally to Pixel 5a (5G) and Pixel Fold models. The other firmware, <strong>AP2A.240705.005</strong>, is exclusive to Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a models. The same handsets on the Telus carrier will receive the <strong>AP2A.240705.005.A1</strong> firmware.</p><p>The latest update, however, doesn&apos;t address the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">factory reset issue</a> that bricked some Pixel phones, including the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, and Pixel 6a. Meanwhile, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/283220215/issues-after-factory-resetting-pixel-6-devices?hl=en&sjid=12145797219137462659-AP">another community post</a>, Google addressed the issue, indicating that the "team has identified the root cause of the issue and is working on developing the best possible solution."</p>
<p>Until then, to avoid the issue, Google recommends leaving the device untouched for at least 15 minutes after a system update. Following this, users can factory reset their devices or, alternatively, factory reset before performing the latest system update.</p><p>The update rollout began Tuesday (July 3) and should be available to the aforementioned Pixel owners in the upcoming weeks. It will be in phases and depend on the carrier and device.</p>

I like the convenience it offers; it&apos;s great to mirror notifications to my wrist without pulling up my phone, and it&apos;s an easier way to set timers and reminders.</p>

<p>The one thing I&apos;ve never done consistently is sleep tracking — it&apos;s just annoying to have to wear a watch to bed, and the few times I tried it, I didn&apos;t get usable metrics, so I decided to not bother. That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> comes into the equation; I started using the smart ring three months ago, and it has drastically changed my point of view of wearables.</p><p>A smart ring isn&apos;t anywhere as cumbersome in daily use, and most of the time, I don&apos;t even realize I&apos;m wearing one. The Ring Air has a minimalist design that doesn&apos;t belie its smarts, and there&apos;s a titanium option available. The wearable does a great job getting out of the way, and that&apos;s the reason why I like it so much; it doesn&apos;t obviate the need for a smartwatch, but augments its functionality.</p><p>The biggest differentiator in my use case is sleep monitoring; having a smart ring log sleep data is much less of a hassle, and it does a good job in this situation, offering detailed metrics. Ultrahuman&apos;s app has good insights into daily activity levels and heart rate data, and while it gets a bit annoying about suggestions — like avoiding caffeine stimulants — it is great to use overall.</p><p>Another reason why I use the Ring Air daily is the battery life; I still only get a day&apos;s worth of use out of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, but the smart ring manages to last up to four days on a charge, and that absolutely makes a difference. While Ultrahuman saw a modicum of attention with the Ring Air, the category in itself is still in its infancy, and it will take the likes of Samsung — and its advertising might — to get mainstream user interest. With Samsung slated to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> shortly, here&apos;s what I want to see in the wearable.</p>
<h2 id="activity-monitoring-2">Activity monitoring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-finger-on-top-of-pillow.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air on the author's index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ring Air is decent at measuring number of steps walked over the course of the day, it doesn&apos;t do as good a job with workouts. You&apos;ll need to manually log workouts, and have the app active in the background to monitor activity — I made the mistake of launching a workout and closing it, only to see that it doesn&apos;t track activity that way.</p><p>The second issue is that workout data is inconsistent, and that&apos;s something Samsung needs to get absolutely right with the Galaxy Ring. Samsung has a wealth of history it can leverage from its Galaxy Watch series, and the brand needs to offer the ability to log a variety of workouts, and even have automatic workout detection — that would be a big bonus.</p>
<h2 id="comfortable-fit-2">Comfortable fit</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-black-03.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AmRxLdP5UdGAuaUwLxW62M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While most smartwatches undoubtedly look the part of tech accessories — this is particularly true of Samsung&apos;s offerings — a smart ring needs to be fashionable. A bigger consideration is the fit; as it&apos;s something you wear on your finger, it needs to be light and svelte, and Ultrahuman nailed the design brief with the Ring Air in this regard.</p><p>Based on the little that Samsung revealed of the Galaxy Ring, it looks like the brand&apos;s smart ring will follow similar design guidelines. Samsung tends to go overboard with features, and that&apos;s not something I want in a smart ring; I don&apos;t require notification alerts or LEDs on the thing — I just need a wearable that&apos;s unobtrusive.</p>
<h2 id="good-battery-life-2">Good battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GysMcyq9sbL7Fcwmps6F4J" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-Charger.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air seated on its proprietary charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GysMcyq9sbL7Fcwmps6F4J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the area where Samsung needs to pay particular attention; the Galaxy Watch 6 manages to last two days on a charge, but the Galaxy Ring needs to at least double that. It shouldn&apos;t be hard to achieve as the existing slate of smart rings hit that number comfortably, but Samsung made enough mistakes in the wearable category in the past, and it needs to avoid making new ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>I haven&apos;t really cared about Samsung&apos;s wearables for a long time now, but I am excited about the Galaxy Ring. Smart rings are the next big thing in wearables, and Samsung is ideally positioned to take this segment into its next phase of growth. While it would be great to see an aggressive price for the Galaxy Ring, that&apos;s unlikely — if the brand manages to not get sucked into a subscription-based offering, I&apos;ll count that as a win.</p>

<ul><li>The Tensor G5 chip's design is reportedly finished and ready for manufacturing, using TSMC's latest 3nm process for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Google's move from Samsung to TSMC for the Tensor G5 signals a shift to fully custom chips.</li><li>Google switched from Samsung supposedly due to challenges with 3nm chip production, citing low yields and high power consumption.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Pixel 10 is expected to launch in 2025, but development is already well underway. A new report suggests that the core chipset, known as the Tensor G5, has completed its design phase (tape out) and is ready for manufacturing.</p><p>A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20240629700043-430501" target="_blank">report</a> from Taiwan hints at a big change in Google&apos;s approach to the Pixel 10&apos;s processor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Tensor-G5-Pixel-10-series-SoC-allegedly-tapes-out-on-TSMC-s-3-nm-node.855455.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). The upcoming Tensor G5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-testing-tsmc-made-tensor-chips-instead-of-samsung">is said to be manufactured based on TSMC&apos;s latest 3nm process</a>, aiming to boost both performance and battery life. This move marks a shift away from Google&apos;s previous partnership with Samsung, where they worked together on chip production and design, especially for the first Tensor chip.</p><p>The supposed completion of the Tensor G5 design reinforces Google&apos;s move towards a fully customized chip strategy. This exclusivity could mean future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> from the search giant will be able to offer unique features and address past issues. </p><p>Battery life and thermal management, which have been notable pain points for recent Google phones, might see major improvements as well.</p><p>Reportedly, Google chose to part ways with Samsung due to difficulties in producing 3nm chips at the South Korean tech giant&apos;s foundries. The main issues cited were low yields and high power consumption, which could lead to shortages and poor battery performance.</p><p>Google&apos;s Tensor G5 is a big deal because it could help the company build a complete package. It would be able to control everything from the chip and operating system to the apps and device itself, which gives it a leg up in the smartphone race. Plus, the Tensor G5 is set to turbocharge Google&apos;s AI efforts, making on-device AI even smarter and more immersive.</p><p>Up to now, all Tensor chips have been rooted in Samsung&apos;s Exynos line. Predictably, similar to Exynos, Tensor chips have wrestled with overheating problems that can sap battery life and hinder performance—something Google Pixels haven&apos;t always excelled at.</p><p>Completing the Tensor G5 design gives Google nearly a year to rigorously test its performance and efficiency, fine-tuning as needed along the way.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like Netflix is dropping its least expensive ad-free plan and pushing users to pay more than usual to access the platform without ads.</p><p>According to several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/">Reddit posts</a>, Netflix&apos;s $11.99 ad-free plan will be discontinued for customers on July 13. They must choose between a $6.99 plan that streams ads versus a $15.49 ad-free plan or the $22.99 ad-free 4K (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/netflix-killing-its-cheapest-plan/"> Android Police</a>).</p><p>The user&apos;s streaming is interrupted by a page that states their "basic plan has been discontinued" and that "you can change your plan at any time."</p>

<p>Based on the Reddit complaints, it seems the streaming giant may first be testing out the updated offerings in the UK or Canada before expanding to other regions (including the U.S.).</p><p>One user on Reddit stated that Netflix wasn&apos;t allowing them to watch shows on their current ad-free plan without subscribing to the new one. "There&apos;s no option to continue watching without selecting a new plan," they said.</p><p>Some people feel that Netflix is simply not addressing the concerns of middle-class viewers. </p><p>"You&apos;re now either a poverty-class ad-supported viewer at $6 or a wealthy-class member at $16.50." While others have openly stated that they&apos;ve discontinued their subscriptions because they can&apos;t keep up with the rising costs. </p><p>This move doesn&apos;t come out of the blue, though.  Earlier this year, during its Q4 earnings call, Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">publicly announced </a>that it had begun an effort to push customers to either more expensive or ad-supported plans. </p><p>"Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term," Netflix said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/NEW-FINAL-Q4-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">statement</a>. </p><p>"On the advertiser side, we continue to improve the targeting and measurement we offer our customers."</p><p>While we can speculate why Netflix is trying to raise its prices, it appears that Netflix users are being pushed to pay extra for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/netflix-announces-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">ongoing projects</a>, like live programming and on-platform gaming. However, not all of those subscribers will be using those added services on the platform and will end up paying for them.</p><p>It is important to note that, despite people unsubscribing to the service, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnbc.com/2024/04/18/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2024.html">CNBC</a>, Netflix&apos;s memberships rose by 16% in the first quarter of 2024, reaching 269.6 million, and its net income was around $2.33 billion.</p>
