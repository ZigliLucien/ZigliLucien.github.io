<ul><li>Google is teasing the Pixel 9 Pro with a YouTube Short, which goes over 22 reasons you should "say goodbye" to your current smartphone.</li><li>The cryptic video doesn't tell us a lot about the new Pixel 9 Pro; in fact, it mentions a lot of existing Pixel features.</li><li>We'll have to see more about what the Pixel 9 series will bring before we buy into Google's argument that you should get ready to replace your phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to have considerably rushed its Pixel release schedule this year, first announcing an Aug. 13 launch event. Then, it officially revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">a teaser for the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, in a rare move for the company. This release cycle is anything but the norm for Google, and it has culminated in a YouTube Shorts teaser that might reveal more about the Pixel 9 Pro. </p><p>The video is titled "22 reasons you should say goodbye to your phone and hello to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pixel9/shorts">#Pixel9</a> Pro with Gemini," and you&apos;d think the video would be as simple as that. However, it isn&apos;t quite that straightforward. It contains an assortment of cryptic Pixel references that don&apos;t really tell us that much about the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship smartphones</a>. In fact, you could argue that Google&apos;s original teasers for the new devices revealed more than this Short. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/77hkN3SaSuM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Here&apos;s a full rundown of Google&apos;s 22 reasons you should upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro:</p>
<ul><li>Wishing your photo had more scenery</li><li>Forgetting the movie your friend recommended </li><li>Forgetting the show your friend recommended </li><li>Phone calls where you can barely hear the other person </li><li>Concert videos that look too far away</li><li>Your toddler is looking everywhere except the camera</li><li>Scrubbing videos for answers </li><li>Gatekeeping </li><li>So many emails. So little time. </li><li>Screening calls yourself</li><li>Half the fam is looking at the camera</li><li>Not capturing the right moment </li><li>Spending hours on hold</li><li>The sky not being right </li><li>The same old memes</li><li>Lost in translation </li><li>Forgetting what restaurant your friend liked</li><li>Awkward photo requests to strangers</li><li>Mom never being in the pic </li><li>Photobombers </li><li>Blurry photo</li><li>Writer's block</li></ul>
<p>The second that you start to think about the items that are on this list, it becomes immediately clear that many of these features are already available on Pixel devices. For example, the reference to "photobombers" probably relates to Magic Editor and Magic Eraser, which you can use on current Pixel devices — and even non-Pixel phones, for Magic Eraser. The same goes for "screening calls yourself," which is obviously a callback to the Call Screen feature on Pixel phones. </p><p>There are also plenty of references to current artificial intelligence features available through Google AI and Gemini. The last of the 22 reasons is "writer&apos;s block," and that&apos;s almost certainly a reference to Help Me Write. "Your toddler looking everywhere except the camera" definitely refers to Best Take, the Pixel 8 series feature that can blend multiple photos together to form the best shot. "Scrubbing videos for answers" could refer to many AI features on YouTube, including AI-generated summaries. </p><p>However, there are some things that sound like new features here. For starters, the "wishing your photo had more scenery" bullet point sounds a lot like what Samsung just introduced with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 series. It added a feature called Sketch to Image, which turns your drawing into an AI-generated object that can be added to an existing photo. Perhaps Google plans to copy this feature for the Pixel 9 Pro launch, and that&apos;s the first reason for referencing it. </p><p>Additionally, there are a few hints that Google may be indeed prepping a feature similar to Microsoft Recall. For those unfamiliar, Recall was a Windows 11 and Copilot+ feature that was supposed to capture screenshots of everything you do on your computer. Then, it would use AI to index all that data and make it easily searchable. It&apos;s like a <em>memory</em> for your PC. According to rumors, Google may be introducing a feature similar to Android 15, and it could be a Pixel exclusive.</p><p>"Forgetting the movie your friend recommended" and "Forgetting the show your friend recommended" could be teasers about a Recall-esque featue. The point about "Forgetting what restaurant your friend liked" could be related to this feature, too. However, these references could be as simple as an enhanced search feature in Google Messages — we really don&apos;t know yet. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i" name="Pixel-9-Pro-Fold.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Made by Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s precisely the problem with Google&apos;s 22 reasons for upgrading to the Pixel 9 series: they&apos;re just not all that convincing. Many of the features can be had on existing Pixel devices — even ones that are a few years old. The potentially new features are hinted at in such a cryptic way that it&apos;s tricky to decipher what they actually are. Plus, these are mostly AI-based software features, which average consumers have been uninterested to date.</p><p>But hey, Google&apos;s new YouTube Short has people talking about the Pixel 9 series. It really seems like Google is trying to control the narrative around this smartphone launch as much as possible. The early event, paired with multiple teasers and an official announcement, very well may be intended to stave off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-memory-modem-images-leak" target="_blank">leaks and rumors</a>.</p><p>However, it&apos;s way too early to say the Pixel 9 Pro is worth upgrading to. Google&apos;s eight-second teaser might drive up a bit of excitement, but it isn&apos;t moving the needle yet.  </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As Android Central&apos;s resident flip phone guy, I was initially quite excited about the prospect of two flip phones launching so close together. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 was unveiled just weeks after the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 launched, so it was hard not to make comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, that didn&apos;t exactly play out in favor of the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Compared to the Razr Plus 2024, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is very much an iterative update over its predecessor. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t upgrades to be found, and some of them are the kind of upgrades we hoped to see on last year&apos;s model. And, of course, there&apos;s plenty of new software to play around with, as Galaxy AI is pretty much running the show.</p><p>So, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> worth buying? I&apos;ve spent roughly two weeks with the phone, so hopefully, this initial review can give you enough insight to decide.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">launched</a> the Galaxy Z Flip 6 on July 10 during the Galaxy Unpacked July 2024 event. The phone goes on sale on July 24 and retails for $1099.</p><p>You can choose either 256GB or 512GB of storage, although the latter option will cost $1219. If you preorder the phone, you can get a free upgrade to the higher storage option, although it&apos;s unclear how long this and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 6 deals</a> are going to last.</p><p>There are several available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors</a> to choose from, including Yellow, Mint, Silver Shadow, and Blue. If you order from Samsung.com, you can purchase exclusive colors such as Crafted Black, White, and Peach.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-03.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a blue table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V8AvqfT8JFyXTGDiy8s4s3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as design goes, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 made few changes from the Galaxy Z Flip 5. It now has a completely flat Aluminum Armor frame with a matte finish instead of a glossy one, a change reminiscent of the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also a hair thinner when folded; otherwise, it&apos;s the same size and weight as its predecessor. It&apos;s a bit impressive, given some of the spec bumps the phone has received, which I&apos;ll talk about later. And speaking of fold, the hinge is very stiff and sturdy, just like the rest of the phone.</p><p>One big upgrade we see this year is the inclusion of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance rating</a>, bringing the phone to IP48. This ensures it&apos;s protected against particles larger than 1mm in size, so it&apos;s not foolproof, but it&apos;s a major improvement nonetheless.</p><p>Even with the impressive durability, I recommend adding a case. Fortunately, we have a collection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> for you to check out. I personally like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7C9BLD4">this one from Thinborne</a>.</p>

<p>The internal 6.7-inch OLED display retains the 2640 x 1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, although the brightness has been jacked up to 2600 nits. The result is a display that is quite bright and vibrant, even with the screen mode set to Natural (my preference). I often find that the built-in screen protector can hinder the view a bit on foldables, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case with the Galaxy Z Flip 6. It&apos;s also very visible outdoors, which is a huge plus.</p><p>Another win is the crease, which Samsung has drastically minimized thanks to "enhanced layers" on the main screen. Now, when I run my finger across the display, the crease is hardly noticeable, although not completely nonexistent.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy brings a welcome performance bump (although the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was plenty powerful) along with the 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB. This phone breezes through everything you throw at it. I&apos;ve played a few games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, and the gameplay is incredibly smooth, even at the highest settings. It probably won&apos;t blow any of the best gaming phones out of the park, but you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed in the performance.</p>

<p>Of course, you won&apos;t find a 3.5mm headphone jack, but you will find a decent set of stereo speakers with plenty of depth and clarity when listening to music.</p><p>For battery life, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a larger 4,000mAh battery, which does well when combined with the more efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. I find that I get between six and eight hours of battery life with a single charge, and after unplugging at 8 a.m., the phone will be on its last leg by 8 p.m. The only downside is that despite the bump in battery capacity, the charging speed remains at 25W, while other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> have surpassed that speed.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Cover screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Weather widget on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPTURLLLkEpCBZYJS7LCUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, my experience with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen has been mixed. Samsung continues to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">hinder the cover screen experience</a> in the same ways that it did with the Galaxy Z Flip 5, so I won&apos;t really rehash that too much. The focus is on panels, or "widgets," and less on using full apps, and the experience as intended works, for the most part.</p><p>Widgets like Weather are well-designed and mostly do what&apos;s expected of them, providing glanceable information, so you&apos;re <em>hopefully</em> opening your phone less for certain things. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t really interact with them much aside from scrolling through details or selecting different days to view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Samsung now lets you fit multiple widgets onto a single panel. This is somewhat limited, too, as you&apos;ll have to select from preset dimensions. Some options will take up a full panel, while others will fit into 2x2 or 2x4 spaces, but it depends on the app, and you can&apos;t resize them like you can on the Razr Plus 2024 cover screen.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the cover screen experience isn&apos;t much different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. There are some fun new interactive wallpapers, and you can add AI wallpapers to the cover screen. You&apos;ll have to dig into Labs or the Good Lock app if you want to use full apps, but once set up, the experience is decent. There&apos;s still no multitasking, and you&apos;ll still be prompted to open the phone for many things, so be prepared to open the phone more often than not.</p>

<p>I was happy to learn Samsung upgraded the primary camera to a 50MP sensor. While I can&apos;t say now whether it&apos;s <em>significantly</em> better than its predecessor, I&apos;m quite pleased with the result. Images have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy. The camera can struggle a bit with dynamic range, and the sky will often appear blown out. However, I haven&apos;t run into this very often.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung still struggles with movement, so images can come out a little blurry and lacking in detail if your subject isn&apos;t completely still, and there is sometimes some distortion toward the edges of the image. Fortunately, zooming and low light are also handled well, making for a well-rounded camera experience. However, so far, I&apos;m not a fan of how selfies make my darker skin look, showing that Samsung still has some work in this regard.</p>

<p>The video quality is pretty good, and my only complaint here so far is that recording is limited to 4K 60, although who is really recording in 8K resolution?</p><p>There is a new feature in the video mode that effectively turns the phone into a camcorder when you fold it 90 degrees. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder on the top half of the screen and gives you a zoom slighter on the bottom half when you begin recording. It&apos;s a neat way to take advantage of the form factor.</p>

I haven&apos;t had a chance to really test some of these out, such as the upgraded interpreter mode that utilizes the cover screen, but my limited time testing that feature in my hands-on left me quite intrigued.</p><p>I&apos;m both impressed and perplexed by some of the image-generation features. Drawing Assist is truly fascinating and will not only add some fairly realistic and amusing images to your photos via Sketch to Image, but it will also turn your doodles into entertaining "works of art" that only a mother could love.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Generative AI drawing of R2-D2 on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QF7GDsBEH2S7fiDvxVqSd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t say as much about Portrait Studio in Photo Assist, where the phone will attempt to generate artistic versions of faces out of a selection of different styles. My colleague Nick Sutrich and I wanted to like this feature in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">hands-on with the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but the images it would generate looked nothing like us, instead churning out generic-looking faces with at least the same skin tone.</p><p>The experience on my Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no different, leaving me pretty disappointed. Maybe you&apos;ll get lucky and find one that somewhat resembles you if you squint, but this is probably a feature you can ignore (for now).</p>

<p>The Live Effect feature is cool, turning transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-cinematic-wallpaper-on-android-14">Cinematic Wallpapers</a> on a Pixel phone.

I do wish the effect was actually based on motion instead of just looping a video when set on your lock or cover screens, but the effect is still pretty cool.</p>
<p>Aside from the new Galaxy AI features, you also get Google AI features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which I love.</p><p>Samsung is extending its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> software update promise to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, meaning users can expect at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-receive">seven years of updates and OS upgrades</a>.

<p>Foldables are still a growing segment, particularly flip phones, but there are still some good phones that will give the Galaxy Z Flip 6 a run for its money. The most obvious is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which also just launched and will be available for purchase at the same time as the Z Flip 6. OPPO&apos;s Find N3 Flip is also a phone worth considering, particularly if you live outside North America.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 features very similar specs to the Z Flip 6, with a flagship Snapdragon chip, 12GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery. The Razr is $100 cheaper and has a larger, more functional cover screen, which makes it a tempting buy over the Flip. That said, the Flip has a more powerful chipset and better software support (based on Samsung&apos;s track record). Additionally, some may prefer to have an ultrawide camera over a telephoto sensor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> has a great display, a sleek design, and a fantastic camera system. The battery capacity is also larger then most other flip phones, but the phone isn&apos;t really available in North America, so there may be some incompatibilities, and ColorOS is definitely an acquired taste.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're interested in a new flip phone.</li><li>You want access to the latest AI features from Samsung and Google.</li><li>You're already ingrained in Samsung's ecosystem.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're tempted by the cheaper Motorola Razr Plus 2024.</li><li>You want a useful cover screen experience.</li><li>You don't want to spend more than $1000 on a phone.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung is clearly playing it safe with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is more evident by Motorola&apos;s Razr Plus 2024 launch a week prior, offering upgraded specs, a larger cover screen with a refined experience, and a cheaper price tag. That&apos;s not to say this is a bad phone because it&apos;s not. I would normally have no problem recommending this phone because it&apos;s quite a fine phone, but with a $100 price bump, I&apos;m not sure I can recommend this over last year&apos;s just-as-fine Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p><p>If you can find some deals and you&apos;re rocking the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a>, then I&apos;d say go ahead and buy the Galaxy Z Flip 6. But even then, I would almost recommend the Razr Plus 2024 instead, which has already had some intriguing deals ahead of its official sale date.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ll continue testing the phone to see if Samsung can change my mind.

Pessimistic is probably too nice of a word, because when looking at the rest of the market, it&apos;s abundantly clear that Samsung is no longer the market leader.</p><p>As the rumors and leaks made headlines, whatever excitement I had for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 quickly dissipated. And during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, the larger foldable seemed like an afterthought, taking a back seat to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>I understand that book-style foldable phones aren&apos;t as popular, likely due to their higher prices. Along with the fact that not everyone wants or cares about the benefits of having a mini tablet that fits in your pocket. So while many, including my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Derrek</a>, prefer a flip phone, it&apos;s just not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at its Unpacked event on July 10, alongside an array of additional Galaxy devices. The phone is currently available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-preorder-deals">pre-order</a> ahead of its launch on July 24, with a starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB base model and maxing out at $2,259 for the 1TB version.</p><p>Additionally, there are a total of five colors to choose from: Pink, Navy, Silver Shadow, Crafted Black, and White. However, the latter two colors are only available if you purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 6 directly from Samsung&apos;s website.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ui5VEKUhKJxuSo4Edt3GBK" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-14.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5 Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ui5VEKUhKJxuSo4Edt3GBK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 was the first time that I wasn&apos;t actually excited about a new foldable phone. While watching Galaxy Unpacked, I scoffed at the idea that a boxier design would result in me replacing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-oneplus-should-delay-open-2">OnePlus Open</a> as part of my "daily carry." But, as I sit here having spent a little more than a week with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, my opinion is shifting. Slightly.</p><p>One thing is for certain, so far at least, as my opinion hasn&apos;t changed regarding Samsung needing to do something drastic. I mean like a complete overhaul of the design, whether it&apos;s to a tri-fold, adopting the shorter and wider screens of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a>, or something. Save for a few things here and there, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Fold 5 are identical, which was the same as the Fold 4, etc.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-design-and-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Design and Cover Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I&apos;m so pessimistic, what could Samsung possibly have done to even change my mind in the slightest? Well, it actually starts with the boxier design. This move brings it more in line with what we saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, complete with the bottom left corner digging into the palm of my hand.</p><p>On paper, this design tweak brought with it a 1.05mm increase in the dimensions when closed, making for an ever-so-slightly larger cover screen. It really didn&apos;t seem like much, but I&apos;ve noticed that my hands feel less cramped when typing out messages or jotting down some notes. Really, it&apos;s not much of a difference, but it&apos;s enough to be noticeable while still falling far short of the OnePlus Open or Pixel Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-20.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably even more important is that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is substantially lighter than its predecessor. In terms of numbers, Samsung managed to slim it down to 239 grams, a staggering drop from the 253 grams of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>. It&apos;s definitely noticeable, and welcome, especially when using the Fold 6 with one hand while the phone is closed.</p><p>I&apos;ve made it this far without even talking about the inner display or AI, which is more than what some companies can say. That being said, let&apos;s dive into that now, starting with the inner screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hinge"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Hinge</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wpueLMK2uaS5x8s2pxJNBo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-10.jpg" alt="Close-up on Samsung logo on Galaxy Z Fold 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpueLMK2uaS5x8s2pxJNBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else Samsung changed with the design is that it&apos;s now much easier to actually unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6. There&apos;s a little bit more of a gap between the two sides of the frame. This might sound like a bad thing, but the outer border of the inner screen still closes tightly so that dust and debris don&apos;t make it through.</p><p>I discovered this, as one does when using the Fold 6 as a fidget toy. I don&apos;t even know how I managed to do it, but I was able to slightly open the phone with just one hand. The only other book-style foldable I&apos;ve been able to do that with is the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The reason why I&apos;m pointing this out is because it&apos;s just much easier to unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6 compared to the Fold 5. The hinge feels about as perfect as one can get, even smoother than the Pixel Fold and the Open. Not to mention that I don&apos;t feel much resistance (in a good way), and the screen/hinge doesn&apos;t make discomforting noises. I&apos;m hoping the hinge will stay this way, but it&apos;s obviously too early to say with any certainty.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-inner-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Inner screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PrzagfR3vjSSkvhpUAwuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PrzagfR3vjSSkvhpUAwuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Fold 6 open, I&apos;m now staring at a beautiful AMOLED display with a subtle crease down the middle. Seriously, Samsung does make some of the best screens. It&apos;s just a shame and quite frustrating that the company won&apos;t offer any reasons or remedies to those who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">suffer from PWM</a>. One would think that if a company is trying to reach as many people as possible, it would do something or at least give a disclaimer that the screens might affect you negatively.</p><p>Nevertheless, let&apos;s talk about that crease. If I was just going into this thing blind, without having a Fold 5 to compare it to, I&apos;d probably say that the crease is the same with the Fold 6. That&apos;s not the case, as I do notice a slight difference between the two. It&apos;s not much, but there is a difference. However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s because the Fold 5 is a year old, while the Fold 6 is less than a month old, or if Samsung actually did manage to improve the crease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and OnePlus Open crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZwTA5cfMLgqciRjF7wEjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even still, there is one thing that didn&apos;t take me long to notice, as all I had to do was use the inner screen while outside. This thing gets BRIGHT. No, it&apos;s not going to blind you or anything, but it&apos;s definitely brighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung&apos;s display now reaches a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.</p><p>This is the same peak brightness level as Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, surpassing the 1,750 nits found in the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The one thing that the Fold 6s main display doesn&apos;t adopt from the S24 Ultra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">anti-reflective coating</a>. It&apos;s not all that surprising since we&apos;re still working with ultra-thin glass and plastic, but I figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Something else I&apos;m planning on diving deeper into, but thought was worth mentioning are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. The "Sketch to Image" feature, to be more precise. Before going further, I invite you to enjoy a hearty laugh at my drawings. There&apos;s a reason why I take pictures and type on a keyboard for a living.</p><p>Okay, with that out of the way, I think this is arguably one of the coolest things that&apos;s possible with Galaxy AI. You can either draw something out in the Samsung Notes app or use AI to generate images. I know my "artistry" is on par with a 3rd grader, but c&apos;mon, I expected results better than what I got.</p>

<p>However, where this feature managed to impress was when making additions to pictures I&apos;ve taken. For the first one, I tried to draw a sailboat with shark fins surrounding it. So while it didn&apos;t exactly get what I was going for, the end result was much better than expected, even adding reflections in the water.</p>

<p>Next up, was drawing a crown on my son&apos;s head of a picture I snapped while out at a local crab house. This one turned out just about perfect, and you can&apos;t even tell that it&apos;s AI-generated, except for the watermark in the bottom left corner. There&apos;s no way to avoid this, even when using Samsung&apos;s built-in wallpaper generator.</p><p>Last but not least, a bear made a surprise appearance while I was walking down to a local beach. Okay, but seriously, this is the fun stuff when it comes to the onslaught of AI generators and buzzwords. The only problem is that, at least with Sketch to Image, it&apos;s really just a parlor trick, albeit an impressive one.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things I&apos;m going to save for the full review, such as the camera along with diving deeper into performance and battery life. With performance, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy performs just as well as you&apos;d suspect. The Fold 6 is fast and snappy, as I have yet to run into any game-breaking slow-downs, save for when I&apos;m trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulate Switch games</a>. But again, more on that in the full review.</p><p>Although I talked about a lot here, there&apos;s still so much more that I want to cover, such as Samsung DeX, the cameras, and gaming. Even still, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has managed to surprise and impress, despite me having basically written it off before Samsung announced it. I don&apos;t know what else I&apos;ll find in my testing, but be sure to reach out if there&apos;s something specific you would like to see covered.</p>

It’s hot pink, and besides the fact that Paris Hilton was sporting the same device, you’re gushing to your friends about the cool new ringtones and selfies you’re about to take. Your phone rings, and when you’re done talking to your mom, you flip the phone shut with a satisfying snap. </p>

<p>Imagine that same concept, except it’s now 2024, and the only thing I can think about is Motorola’s incredibly strategic marketing approach for the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. It has convinced me that the company knows <em>exactly </em>how to grab the heartstrings of nostalgic millennials like me while also creating a vintage feel and interest for an up-and-coming form factor for those in their early 20s. </p><p>I would even argue that because of this strong marketing and the actual changes the company has made to the phone, it could potentially be the best flip phone of the year and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone"><u>best-selling foldable devices</u></a>. </p><p>More recently, I’ve closely been watching multiple ads pop up for the phone on my TikTok feed, with similar ads cross-promoted on Instagram Reels.</p><p>What caught my attention was how nostalgic and down-to-earth so many of these ads were. They still had high production value, but most ads showcased times we spent hanging out with friends. One ad (below) showed someone doing a Get Ready With Me video, talking about going to a Y2K-themed party and taking their Razr Plus phone with them.</p>

<p>While many of these ads showcased millennials talking about the phone, many also targeted Gen Z.</p><p>It’s not every day that you come across a phone brand that was once incredibly popular, fell short of proper direction and strategy, and now is one that threatens some top-performing companies. </p>
<h2 id="a-familiar-face-form-factor-and-x201c-saving-vintage-x201d-xa0-2">A familiar face, form factor, and “saving vintage” </h2>
<p>Right off the bat, let’s talk about Paris Hilton. Whether you are a fan or not, she’s an icon, and Motorola was brilliant in using her as the face of the brand.</p><p>The company decided to make 2024 feel like 2006 again when it released a hot pink version of the phone. More importantly, having Hilton be the person who shows off the smartphone version of the original Razr—now “<em>that’s hot.”</em> </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL" name="Paris-Hilton-before-after-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="A young Paris Hilton with the original Hot Pink Razr V3 and again with the new Hot Pink Razr Plus 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfRiFmfMmBZRvoxJ24B9mL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram / Paris Hilton)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s worldwide device tracker, agrees that Hilton “helped popularize the Razr back in the late 2000s, and having her reprise that role is a nice throwback.”</p><p>Of course, Motorola isn’t the only company to use a celebrity as the face of its brand. Samsung has done so, too, by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/medialibrary/global/photo/54939">using Sydney Sweeney</a> during the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> and Z Flip 6. However, in the case of Sweeny, she captures a very specific younger audience, and perhaps it doesn’t go beyond that. </p><p>Meanwhile, Anshel Sag, a senior analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that using Hilton “allows Motorola to reach a fairly broad audience that looks to a popular pop-culture figure that is multi-generational.”</p>

<p>We know foldable phones are not a new concept and were introduced many years ago, but the resurgence of clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> is an indication of companies taking something older and refreshing it. Where Motorola has gone beyond Samsung is readjusting its marketing to also fit a younger demographic who might feel the foldable form factor to be “vintage,” and cool.</p><p>Like with any product, we’re noticing younger generations interested in products that were once popular, and as Vogue nicely put it, “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/paris-hilton-on-vintage-bad-haircut-pink-motorola-flip-phone" target="_blank">Paris is saving vintage</a>” 20 years later.</p><p>“I have so many memories of my Razr. Taking selfies with my friends, using it like a fashion accessory—I would clip it on my low-rise jeans and show it off, it’d always have crystals on it. I also loved prank calling people on it or using it like a prop and walking through crowds pretending to be talking on it,” Hilton tells Vogue. </p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 not only looks vintage AND nostalgic at the same time, it plays into both those emotions. But beyond that, its camera has a photobooth feature and also sports a 2x telephoto camera for portrait images instead of an ultrawide sensor, which many would find strange, especially for a flip phone. </p>

<p>Ubrani thinks that this fits well with Gen Z and their needs “as they tend to prioritize selfies over landscapes,” which ironically was also something I loved to prioritize in my early 20s. </p><p>Apart from that, the new phone has a larger more functional cover screen, bigger main display with a higher refresh rate, and faster charging speeds than the Flip. The company also uses vegan leather instead of glass on the back to help it stand out even more against phones with traditional glass backs.</p><p>The phone is unique enough that even iPhone users have been taking an interest in it. As one user named CarelessPangolin2890 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razr/comments/1dznx6j/im_an_iphone_user_deep_in_their_ecosystem_but_the/"><u>writes in a Reddit post</u></a>, “I’m an iPhone user deep in the ecosystem, but the Razr+ 2024 is really calling me!” </p><p>Another user, Unwitched, writes “I’m on the same boat! My boyfriend and I are both iPhone users, since the 1st generation for me and the 4th or 5th for him, and we decided we wanted to switch to this phone when we saw a commercial for it a few months ago. </p><p>“[To be honest] we’re just taking the plunge and going for it. I haven’t been excited for the latest iPhone for several years now and I’ve grown bored.”</p>

<p>The fact is that Motorola took a while to develop its new and improved foldable strategy, particularly after taking some time off from the U.S. to essentially find itself.</p><p>Motorola has always been a pioneer in creating fun and colorful phones in a time when blocks and colorlessness were the norm. It was on stage with the likes of Nokia, LG, Samsung, and Blackberry, but unlike its peers, Motorola wanted to be different and really stand out and did so by releasing the thinnest flip phone at the time.</p><p>But it’s experienced many ups and downs, going from being a popular brand to one that struggled to compete seriously in the smartphone market with seemingly no clear strategy, particularly regarding foldable phones.</p>

<p>Android Central’s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-needs-put-work-maintain-its-spot" target="_blank">wrote a scathing article in 2021</a> about how the company had not met expectations in a very competitive landscape. </p><p>He wrote, “While I respect Motorola’s hustle to make a phone for everyone, I can’t help being disappointed every time the company announces a new smartphone for the U.S. market.,” adding that at the time, Motorola just seemed like it was “doing the bare minimum when it comes to the mobile industry.”</p><p>The company showed off its 2021 lineup, and “absolutely none of the devices look remotely interesting.” </p><p>But perhaps it was losing LG in the smartphone market and putting the spotlight on Motorola that forced the company to take a hard look in the mirror and step it up.</p>

<p>Ubrani says this “helped the brand succeed with a younger audience who doesn’t want the same brand as their parents or other older folks. Motorola went from a pioneer mobile phone maker to a dominant one to an underdog to potentially a leader of the counterculture as Gen Z picks up the brand.” </p><p>Sag agrees, adding that “the Razr series is the tip of that spear, and they seem to be doing the best there in terms of marketing.”</p><p>And all of this literally happened in the span of a couple of decades.</p>

<p>This brings us back to my main point about how the Razr Plus 2024, very clearly, could be the best flip phone of the year. </p><p>In his review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review"><u>Lee writes that the phone</u></a> has exceeded all of his expectations, that the company “seemed to address just about everything that [he] didn’t like about last year’s Razr Plus while adding some upgrades [he] didn’t expect.”</p><p>The result is a phone that we believe “sets a new standard for flip phones.”</p><p>“Of course, no one is perfect, and the Razr Plus 2024 has its quirks. But Samsung should really be taking notes for the Galaxy Z Flip lineup because Motorola is really doing something special with its 2024 Razr lineup,” Lee writes.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-x201c-should-certainly-feel-threatened-x201d-xa0-2">Samsung “should certainly feel threatened” </h2>
<p>How awkward was it then that the day after, Lee writes in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"><u>Samsung Z Flip 6 hands-on</u></a> that the phone is a “losing battle,” further pointing out that “this feels familiar, but not in a good way.”</p><p>“The Galaxy Z Flip 6 reminds me a lot of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024…but somehow, it might be a worse version of what Motorola has managed to pull off surprisingly well.” </p><p>It also didn’t help Samsung’s case when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">early reported numbers</a> indicated the company achieved 910,000 foldable units pre-ordered in South Korea, much smaller than its record-shattering number in 2023. It also reported that pre-orders dropped by 10%. Meanwhile, Motorola has seen its foldable market share grow as Samsung&apos;s shrinks amid stiff competition.</p>

<p>Ubrani believes now is a time when Samsung “should certainly feel threatened.” </p><p>This is partly because the company’s dominance amongst foldables has been eroded by Chinese vendors in Asia/Europe and companies like Motorola in the U.S. </p><p>Though Ubrani does add that “while we don’t have data on this, there’s the possibility that Samsung’s scale has allowed it to maintain higher profits compared to Motorola, and if that’s the case, then the situation may not be as dire for Samsung as we think.”</p><p>Regardless of all of this, what brings my focus back to Motorola every year is that it listens to its audience. It understands what they want and is trying to have a cohesive brand that is creative in a world where there’s a lot of foldable competition. </p><p>I don’t think I will be a fan of foldable phones until companies are able to figure out a better material for the screen that minimizes the crease to the point where it’s non-existent. But I can strongly say that the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is a phone I’m closely monitoring and thinking about; maybe it might be the phone that will make me love foldables.</p>

<hr>
<p>Cellular services in the U.S. are mostly handled by a select few carriers, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a>. When you purchase or activate a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new phone</a> with a carrier, the smartphone can be "locked" to that carrier for a period of time. Essentially, this restriction prevents phones from being used with a competing carrier until they are "unlocked." As of now, the requirements governing when phones are locked — and how they can be unlocked — are set by each carrier individually. </p><p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) isn&apos;t thrilled with this arrangement, and is proposing an alternative. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A1.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> issued Thursday, July 18, the FCC explained how a change in unlocking rules could reduce customer confusion by introducing a standardized process. </p><p>"Currently, mobile service providers use a variety of unlocking policies—some abide by voluntary industry standards while others are subject to more stringent and enforceable unlocking requirements as a result of transaction commitments or rules specific to certain frequency bands," the FCC said. "This proposed rulemaking seeks to ensure the customers of all mobile service providers can expect the same baseline of unlocking standards and resources."</p><p>Under the proposed set of rules, all cellular carriers would be required to unlock devices within 60 days of their activation. The move is intended to increase competition, as it would be easier to switch from one carrier to another. In some cases, phones currently need to be unlocked manually through a customer request. Manually needing to ask cellular carriers like AT&T or T-Mobile is a significant obstacle to making the switch to another alternative. </p><p>However, this proposal isn&apos;t going to take effect anytime soon. For now, the FCC is merely issuing what is known as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The agency is making its proposal known and will seek comments and feedback on the proposed rule changes. For example, it wants to know whether a potential rule change should be applied to existing contracts or future contracts and how it would affect carrier deals and promotions. </p><p>This is a significant hurdle to overcome because most carriers today will not unlock a device until it is completely paid off. Installment plans from cellular carriers can last as long as 36 months today. It&apos;s already difficult to pay off your phone early because doing so may result in losing promotional credits or discounts. If the FCC&apos;s 60-day requirement doesn&apos;t apply until after phones are completely paid off, this proposed policy may not have as much of an impact. </p><p>These are just a few things that the FCC wants feedback about during the public comment period. The conversation will be extensive, and I&apos;d guess there will be some carrier pushback. After this public comment period, the proposed rule can continue to the drafting and revising stages. In other words, it will be quite a while before these potential unlocking requirements actually start making a difference at the consumer level. </p>

<p>The FCC plainly states that this move is intended to reduce confusion, and that&apos;s exactly what we need in the cellular industry. In some cases, cellular carriers already allow their devices to be unlocked within or after a 60-day activation period. However, these requirements are inconsistent and aren&apos;t consumer-friendly. </p><p>For example, AT&T&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/legal/modal/idpassets/fragment/legal/prod/legalmodal/support/smallbusinesskms/km125/km1258553.html" target="_blank">unlocking requirements</a> include eight bullet points and an additional disclaimer, with some legalese in the mix. For the most part, AT&T permits device unlocking after 60 days as long as customers have paid their device and service bills. Unfortunately, the requirements aren&apos;t stated as plainly in the official requirements. The confusing policies and the need to manually request to have a device unlocked may be enough to prevent people from unlocking their phones altogether. </p><p>Somehow, despite multiple competition inquiries into mergers and acquisitions over the years, we&apos;re left with three major cellular carriers in the U.S. Customers need to choose between AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. The smaller brands are limited, and are often owned by one of those three conglomerates. In the rare event that an independent or regional carrier is still privately owned, they usually operate on one of the major networks anyway. Basically, there is little incentive for users to choose anything but one of the three major carriers.</p><p>And due to the swath of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-i-know-whether-my-phone-unlocked">complicated unlocking requirements in place today</a>, it&apos;s not easy to switch between them. So, some users end up feeling stuck with the major carrier they chose in the first place. It&apos;s easy to see why this is a problem, especially as more and more people buy new smartphones via carrier contracts and promotional installment plans. </p><p>The system has arguably been broken for a long time, but perhaps the FCC can make a step in the right direction by standardizing unlocking rules. Under the new proposal, users can expect the same experience regardless of which carrier they use, and won&apos;t have to manually request for their devices to be unlocked. </p>

<p><strong>Carlos asks: </strong></p><p><em><strong>Why does Google send out monthly updates and new features so slow[ly]?

<p>Hi Carlos! I feel you and this is a super frustrating thing that a lot of folks — me included — impatiently go through every time Google announces anything different and new for the phone in our hands. It&apos;s also nothing new and no matter how much we hate it, Google has a really good reason for doing it this way.</p><p>I always front-load the answer so nobody has to read past the first few paragraphs, and this time the answer is really easy: </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-microsoft-windows-outage-disrupts-services-globally"><strong>Huge Microsoft Windows outage disrupts services globally</strong></a></p><p>This is what happens when you send out an update to everyone at the same time.</p>

<p>I was readying this article when last Friday&apos;s Microsoft outage happened and the timing couldn&apos;t have been better. I want to make it clear that Microsoft had nothing to do with thousands of Windows Servers crashing Friday morning and the update that broke everything came from a third-party software vendor named CrowdStrike that provides Windows Server security services. In the end, it didn&apos;t matter because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/next-microsoft-outage-could-affect-you">a single bad update caused global chaos</a> when it went out to everyone at once.</p><p>Google tries to prevent this from happening by slowly rolling out software changes and monitoring what effect they have on the folks who have received them.</p>
<p>It&apos;s been this way since the beginning. Back in 2014 Google Executive Dan Morrill, one of the most recognizable Android developers and part of the original Android team at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1r1dz4/44_kitkat_has_started_rolling_out_on_the_n4/cdiwt6f/">explained why it&apos;s done and how</a>.</p><p>"<em>Rollouts are conducted in phases. Typically they start at 1% of devices for around 24 - 48 hours; we watch the return rates and resulting device check-ins and error reports (if any), and make sure nothing looks wrong before sending it to more. Then typically it goes to 25%, 50%, 100% over the course of a week or two.</em>"</p>
<p>Google knows that no matter how much it tests a new piece of software there is a chance it will break things once it&apos;s released to everyone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">an Android phone</a>. Pixel phones (in this case) aren&apos;t very popular but many of the changes in the monthly update for them are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">incorporated into Android itself</a>, with the potential to reach almost every phone around the world.</p><p>By slowly pushing out a change, and then waiting to see if it breaks anything, the damage is minimized. There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-exposure-bug">botched software rollouts</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pauses-its-messy-december-pixel-6-update-until-late-january">Plenty of them</a>. In most cases, the software was quickly recalled, and whatever caused the problem was fixed, tested, and then slowly rolled out again to make sure it worked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hRtbsHDinAjqyfCvin7BNa" name="Google-Pixel-6-Pro-android-beta-05.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro with red white and blue wallpaper and Android Beta warning message" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hRtbsHDinAjqyfCvin7BNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is standard practice from Google, Apple, Samsung, and almost every other company that makes phones and tablets. Software is developed and tested in-house, then sent out to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">limited number of beta testers</a>, and once everything <em>seems</em> OK it&apos;s sent out slowly to gauge its performance. </p><p>This is also why I like to stress that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dont-install-android-15-dev-preview">most people really shouldn&apos;t install any beta software</a> on a device they want to use. It is expected that things will break and is an important part of this process.</p>
<p>it&apos;s frustrating to wait for anything you want to try. Especially when it gets hyped by Google and websites like Android Central. But it&apos;s a lot less frustrating that having a phone that stops working. Let&apos;s hope Google doesn&apos;t decide to stop the slow trollout of new software.</p>

<ul><li>A set of Pixel 9 Pro XL images might've confirmed some interesting specifications ahead of Google.</li><li>The device's fast boot menu states it features 16GB RAM, 256GB of storage, and Samsung's Exynos 5400 modem with satellite communication support.</li><li>Google has been developing its "Satellite SOS" feature for Pixels throughout Android 15's beta period, and rumors state that it was thanks to the Exynos 5400.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new set of alleged hands-on images purport consumers are in for a little out of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>The trio of images were posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-9-pro-xl.4682499/">XDA Forums</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-9-pro-xl.4682499/" target="_blank">,</a> and the user claims that they are of an early Pixel 9 Pro XL (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/21/google-pixel-9-pro-modem-ram-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The device&apos;s fast boot mode highlights its 16GB of Samsung LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of Samsung storage. That&apos;s not all, as the internal specification page details an upgraded modem.</p><p>This appears to be confirmation that users will find Samsung&apos;s Exynos 5400 modem inside the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it launches.</p><p>The post cites the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/modem/exynos-modem-5400/">showcase of the modem</a>, which states the Exynos 5400 is based on the 3GPP Release 17. This means that the modem is capable of providing a "more advanced" 5G mobile experience. Additionally, the Exynos 5400 can reach maximum data throughput speeds of 14.7Gbps.</p><p>However, additional information explains the modem&apos;s support of NB-IoT and NR NTN for satellite communication. Samsung states that the Exynos 5400 can connect a user&apos;s mobile device to "Low Earth orbit" (LEO) satellites to "ensure" large data transmissions.</p>

<p>What&apos;s important about the RAM/storage information is that this device could be another Pixel 9 Pro XL variant. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9-pro-live-photos-surface">previously rumored</a> that the Pixel 9 Pro and the XL share the same 16GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage specifications. The amount of RAM is already an increase from the Pixel 8&apos;s 12GB, however, this supposed introduction of more storage is a welcome sight, too.</p><p>Moreover, this clear look at the device&apos;s modem might put old rumors to bed. It&apos;s been rumored that the Pixel 9 series&apos; satellite communication support would exist thanks to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Exynos 5400 modem</a>.</p><p>The ever flow of Android 15 betas has continued to give us small glimpses at what Google has in store for its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>." A recent find in Beta 4 showed that the SOS service will share your name, email, phone number, location, and device information with 911 to offer assistance. Additionally, there&apos;s speculation that Google is planning to charge users for such emergency services after a brief free period.</p><p>We don&apos;t have much longer to wait as Google is preparing for a much earlier hardware event on August 13.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi debuts its first clamshell foldable phone, the Mix Flip, in China.</li><li>It has a prominent cover screen measuring 4.01 inches and a foldable screen measuring 6.86 inches.</li><li>The company has also released the Mix Fold 4 with a lighter design than the predecessor.</li><li>Both are powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and come with 67W fast charging support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After much anticipation, Xiaomi has finally unveiled its first clamshell foldable phone, the Mix Flip, for the Chinese market. If the company chooses to make it widely available in other regions, it could be a significant rival to the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6. </p><p>While Xiaomi has been in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> business for quite some time now, the company took its sweet time to bring the clamshell phone, which looks interesting with a large cover screen, significantly larger than the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Xiaomi is calling it an All-Around Liquid display that measures 4.01 inches. It further comes with a higher refresh rate of up to 120Hz and has the company&apos;s Shield Glass protection. When unfolded, the clamshell phone features a 6.86-inch foldable screen with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz.</p>

<p>The bezels look thin, and the device uses an aluminum frame all around. The hinge is believed to be SGS-certified and can hold up to 500,000 folds. The Mix Flip also comes in interesting Black, Purple, White, and Xiaomi Nylon Fiber color options.</p><p>Underneath, the Mix Flip is powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and accompanied by 12GB RAM and 512GB of onboard storage. The full-screen cover display also incorporates two rear cameras: a 50MP primary lens and another 50MP telephoto lens—both of which carry the popular Leica branding like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>. The foldable display underneath carries a 32MP selfie shooter.</p><p>The clamshell phone also has a bigger battery capacity; it is 4780mAh and is further backed by a 67W fast charging. The other highlights of the device include a stereo speaker setup, Wi-Fi 7, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based Xiaomi&apos;s HyperOS operating system.</p>

<p>Xiaomi also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> competitor dubbed Mix Fold 4, which comes as the successor to Mix Fold 3. The latest book style features a lighter design, measuring 4.59mm when unfolded and 9.47mm when folded. Xiaomi says the hinge on the Fold 4 is also significantly lighter than the predecessor and yet stronger, and like the flippable phone, it will also withhold 500,000 folds.</p><p>The cover screen measures 6.56 inches and comes with Xiaomi Shield Glass protection. Its brightness can reach 3000 nits, and it has an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The foldable screen on the inside has the same functionalities, but it measures 7.98 inches and is made of ultra-thin glass (UTG).</p>

<p>The foldable phone is also powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 paired with VC liquid cooling. It features up to 16GB RAM and 1TB onboard storage and ships with HyperOS (Android 14). </p><p>For optics, the Mix Fold 4 also includes Leica integration and features a 50MP primary lens next to a 50MP telephoto lens, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and another 10MP periscopic lens.</p><p>A massive 5100mAh battery keeps the lights on both screens, and it also comes with 67W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging. The other key takeaways of the book-style foldable phone include an IPX8 rating for dust resistance, Wi-Fi 7, support for HDR10+ content, and Surge battery management that promises to keep the battery life a bit higher even with those fast charging speeds.</p>

<p>Both new foldables are available in the China region for now, and we hope that Xiaomi will increase its new handset presence outside of China as well. The 12GB+256GB variant of the handset retails CNY 8999, 16GB+512GB costs CNY 9,999, and the larger 16GB+1TB model is set at CNY 10,999. The book-style foldable will be available in White, Black, and Blue colorways next to a fiber edition.</p><p>Meanwhile, the debutant Mix Flip costs CNY 5999 for 12+256GB, CNY 6499 for 12GB+512GB, and CNY 7299 for the larger 16GB+1TB storage variant.</p>

<ul><li>Oura has sent a new product for certification, which appears to be the Ring 4.</li><li>The device features model number "OA11" and is being tested in sizes ranging from seven to fifteen with a completely smooth design.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring debuted on July 10 and has quickly sold out, though Oura's chief marketing officer stated Samsung's entry was "validation" for the brand.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Oura is wasting no time in welcoming more smart ring competition as it starts certifying its next iteration.</p><p>Oura was spotted uploading images for a new product certification by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oura-ring-4-first-look-3463096/">Android Authority</a> and it&apos;s assumed to be the Ring 4. The company has listed a new device with the model number "OA11" and additional information provided seems to double down on the Ring 4 theory.</p><p>The device&apos;s product label states that OA11 is the "Oura Ring 4" alongside other details like a gold hue and a size 15. In other areas, the listing states Oura is testing its next ring in sizes seven, nine, thirteen, and fifteen.</p>

<p>The provided images show that Oura may not change its design language. An angled top-down view of the ring shows that Oura might provide a completely round and smooth wearable this time. The publication states that the ring captured above is a size 10.</p><p>The certification listing mentions a device with model number "OA12," as well. Further information about what that could be is unknown for now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura&apos;s Ring 3</a> from 2021 was mostly smooth and flat, however, the Heritage style variant featured a section that created a plateau. It&apos;s most likely a design choice to help users quickly know how to position the ring on their finger, as that flat portion is intended to sit atop your finger.</p><p>Additionally, the company offers the Ring 3 in sizes ranging from six to thirteen. The listing suggests Oura might look to increase its lowest and highest-size offerings. However, there&apos;s a chance that range could widen in either direction.</p><p>Oura&apos;s quick advance for a new product puts all eyes on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Ring — which only debuted two weeks ago and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">quickly sold out</a>. The Korean OEM&apos;s version mirrors its competitor with a smooth, rounded body and dimensions that help it stay in contention. Samsung has the edge on weight as the Galaxy Ring tops out a 3g (depending on size) while the Oura Ring 3 hits 6g at most.</p><p>But let&apos;s not forget that Oura had started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-retail-amazon-samsung-competition">preparing to take on Samsung</a> in March when it published the Ring 3 on Amazon. The company&apos;s head also sees Samsung&apos;s entry as a "positive" thing, stating it gives Oura "validation."</p>

<ul><li>It seems that Samsung's global Galaxy Tab S10 Plus variant has appeared on Geekbench with important specification details.</li><li>The listing suggests the company will plug MediaTek's Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC into its next tablet generation instead of Qualcomm.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab S10 series is rumored to arrive "later this year," potentially in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With so much anticipation for Samsung&apos;s next tablet series, a recent discovery sheds light on a crucial internal specification.</p><p>Tech devices usually undergo a performance test, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-mediatek-dimensity-chip-globally/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> recently noticed the global version of the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus doing just that. What stands out in its results is the motherboard, which features the codename "GTS10U." It seems likely that this is MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus chipset, which launched in May.</p><p>Last year, Samsung featured Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 series</a>. Additionally, it&apos;s worth reiterating that the publication also spotted the U.S. variant of the Tab S10 Plus, also with the Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC.</p><p>Other details in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7010014">the test results</a> state the device will feature just over 10GB of RAM (likely to be interpreted as 12GB) and Android 14. For its ARM v8 CPU, the listing states the Tab S10 Plus will benefit from four cores at 2GHz, three cores at 2.8GHz, and one core at 3.4GHz. Samsung&apos;s next-gen Plus tablet scored 2,141 in its single-core test and a 5,533 multi-core test score.</p><p>It&apos;s speculated that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra will follow its Plus sibling in using MediaTek&apos;s chip instead of Qualcomm globally.</p>

The company touted the chip&apos;s swifter speed and improved AI processing as its high points.
