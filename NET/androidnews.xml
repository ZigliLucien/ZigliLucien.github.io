<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is starting to roll out a feature on Android that lets users utilize their voice to search for songs they can&apos;t get out of their heads.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/24/youtube-music-song-search-android/">9to5Google</a>, users should begin noticing a wavelength icon beside the microphone symbol when tapping search in YouTube Music (to the far right of the search bar). As of update 7.02, tapping the wavelength symbol produces a colorful page that prompts users to "play, hum, or sing" a tune to run an AI-backed search through the platform. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.94%;"><img id="ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM" name="YouTube-Music-song-identification.jpg" alt="New button to identify a song in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFhReK4c8Xqu7uHxFmxNAM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="399" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> gets a match, users are given a simple splash page with all the information about the song. The "results" page shows a song&apos;s album cover, title, group (or artist), and the album&apos;s title with its debut year.

<p>While the new song identification has been spotted in version 7.02 of YouTube Music, the feature is reportedly activated via a server-side update. In the meantime, users should ensure they&apos;re running the latest app version. Despite running software version 7.02.51 we haven&apos;t noticed the feature yet.</p><p>Users will be familiar with the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">humming to search</a> for a song as the Google app has had it for a few years now. You&apos;re able to hum, sing, or even whistle, and Search will try and match the melody to the correct song. Similarly, a type of song identification hit Pixels a few months ago, letting the device keep its ears open to songs. Through "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a>," Pixel phones can identify what song is playing if enabled and can notify the user so they&apos;re not dreading it later.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">Gemini extension</a> finally arrived for Android and desktop users yesterday (May 23).

Asking Gemini to "play" a song works on Android, however, it&apos;s not functioning properly on the web yet.</p>

<hr>
<p>In a surprise move, Spotify announced Thursday, May 23, that it would completely drop support for the Car Thing later this year, bricking every device sold. Car Thing was Spotify&apos;s first hardware product, announced in early 2021. It served as an intermediary between your smartphone and your car, specifically targeted at cars that didn&apos;t have Android Auto or Apple CarPlay Support. The tiny touchscreen device was marketed as a simpler and safer way to play Spotify tunes while driving. </p><p>When the Car Thing debuted, the general consensus was that it was a neat idea without a clear purpose. In fact, in our own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-car-thing-review">Car Thing review</a>, we came to the same conclusion. It had a quality design, simple UI, and voice control — but was it really necessary as more and more cars started shipping with proprietary infotainment systems, Android Auto support, and Apple CarPlay capabilities?</p><p>Spotify seemingly came to the same conclusion. The company made the Car Thing widely available in February 2022 and stopped making new ones five months later. Now, as of Dec. 9, 2024, Spotify is killing support for Car Thing entirely. That doesn&apos;t just mean it won&apos;t provide Car Thing software updates or aftersale support. It&apos;s actively bricking every hardware device it ever sold. Car Things will work perfectly fine on Dec. 8 and will become E-waste by Dec. 10. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZwzkcUB9sHLG9aKgpoMmpb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-presets.jpg" alt="Wider view of Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZwzkcUB9sHLG9aKgpoMmpb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every device will eventually reach end-of-life status, so Spotify dropping support for Car Thing isn&apos;t egregious on its own. However, products and accessories that depend on server-side support to function are in a whole different category and should follow a separate set of rules. When you buy something like Car Thing, which depends on Spotify&apos;s service to provide any value, there is an expectation that the service will be upheld for a reasonable amount of time. </p><p>Spotify stopped making Car Things in late July 2022 and sold existing stock for a period of time thereafter. Let&apos;s say you bought a Car Thing in July 2022. In that scenario, Car Thing will only have been supported for about 17 months. Now is a good time to also point out that this <em>thing</em> sold for $90. Again, Spotify isn&apos;t just ending software support or customer service for Car Thing; it is rendering the device completely useless. </p><p>That&apos;s the gamble that comes with buying hardware products that cannot function without support from a company. In these situations, one could argue there is an implied agreement between buyer and seller that support will be offered for some time. </p>

<p>Spotify dropping support for Car Thing is different than, say, Apple dropping iOS support for an iPad. The oldest internet-connected device I own is the first-generation iPad, which was released in 2010 and received its last iOS update (5.1.1) in 2012. Not every internet and server-supported feature works on that iPad; in fact, many of them don&apos;t work at all. But I can still use the iPad, access all my apps and games, and even connect to the internet. The equivalent to Spotify&apos;s decision would have been if Apple just told me to throw away my iPad in 2012.</p><p>In fact, Spotify says in its announcement that it recommends "safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines."</p><p>The egregious part of Spotify&apos;s choice to brick Car Things is that these devices don&apos;t require any additional upkeep on the company&apos;s end. Car Thing is a tethered device that needs a smartphone to function and connects to the Spotify app on your phone. There isn&apos;t public knowledge of any Car Thing feature or service that requires additional server support or infrastructure to function beyond those that everyone uses when they connect with any Spotify client. In other words, I can&apos;t think of a practical reason that Spotify is killing Car Thing other than because it can. </p><p>Spotify&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/" target="_blank">support document</a> and the email it sent to users seem to support my version of the events. The email starts with a single sentence: "We&apos;re switching gears." Spotify wants to put the Car Thing behind it and will brick devices to that end. </p><p>"We have made the decision to discontinue Car Thing. This means that Car Thing will no longer be operational," Spotify explained in a support document. "This decision wasn&apos;t made lightly, and we want to assure you that our commitment to providing a superior listening experience remains unchanged."</p>

<p>At first, I thought I was the only one disgusted by Spotify&apos;s treatment of the Car Thing. My reaction was, in part, because I think the Car Thing was a really cool concept that could&apos;ve taken off. However, I was surprised to find that there is a small but passionate cohort of Car Thing users who are just as disappointed by Spotify&apos;s actions. In posts on social media, some pointed out their dissatisfaction with the lack of refunds offered by Spotify for their Car Thing purchase. </p>

<h2 id="does-the-spotify-car-thing-have-a-place-in-2024-2">Does the Spotify Car Thing have a place in 2024</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QD5pKjCjbrfoNVTUawvPvb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-air-vent.jpg" alt="Air vent details on Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QD5pKjCjbrfoNVTUawvPvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth wondering whether Car Thing had a place in 2024, at a time when most cars are equipped with some sort of built-in infotainment system. I happen to think that Car Thing did have a reason to exist since there are plenty of older cars without support for media control. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/android-for-cars-bringing-more-apps-to-cars.html#:~:text=With%20over%20200%20million%20cars,apps%20to%20cars%20is%20now." target="_blank">says</a> that there are over 200 million cars on the road with Android Auto, and that sounds like a lot until you realize there are just shy of 1.5 billion cars on the road worldwide, according to 2024 numbers from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2021/06/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world/" target="_blank">Hedges & Company</a>. </p><p>But it really doesn&apos;t matter whether Car Thing needed to exist because Spotify already stopped making the hardware. This only concerns the software. As we mentioned earlier, there isn&apos;t a clear reason Spotify needs to discontinue software support for Car Thing. Regardless of whether Car Thing was a good idea or not, the bottom line is simple: Spotify sold them, so it has an obligation to support them.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-car-thing-2">What can we learn from Car Thing?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4dzE8xxgM56WCMfvXzgueb" name="Spotify-Car-Thing-voice.jpg" alt="Using voice access on Spotify Car Thing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4dzE8xxgM56WCMfvXzgueb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First, I want to emphasize that there&apos;s still time for Spotify to right this wrong, and I hope the negative sentiment around the company&apos;s actions causes it to rethink its approach. We just saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/sony-apologies-and-says-theyre-removing-the-requirement-for-a-psn-account-on-helldivers-2-a-day-after-removing-it-from-steam-for-over-2-billion-people">Sony reverse course</a> on a decision it made to require PSN accounts for the game Helldivers 2 following public pressure, so it&apos;s possible. While refunds for Car Thing are probably unlikely, I think Spotify offering a credit that could be used for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">Spotify Premium</a> subscriptions would be a fair resolution to the issue. </p><p>Moving forward, Spotify&apos;s treatment of Car Thing should serve as a reminder for consumers to be wary of buying hardware from software companies, especially when said hardware is dependent on services, because it usually doesn&apos;t end well. If this situation doesn&apos;t make you reconsider supporting Spotify as a company, at least let it be a warning for buying server-supported hardware in the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out another iterative update for the Android 14 QPR3 beta, which aims to continue to sort out some issues with the software ahead of the stable release.</p><p>The company announced the start of Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cyzh41/android_14_qpr3_beta_22_now_available/">on Reddit</a> with build number AP21.240305.006. The May 2024 security patch is included in this for the following supported devices: Pixel 5a, 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, and Pixel Tablet.</p><p>This patch is notably smaller than Beta 2.1, with Google only highlighting two fixes in the latest version.</p><p>Enrolled Pixel users are receiving a fix for dropped cellular connections. The company states users have continuously reported such problems despite having a strong connection to a cellular network. Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/322380000">reports</a> were from users with a Pixel 7 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/315328193">a 5G network</a> from Mint and T-Mobile.</p><p>Google ends its patch notes by stating the final fix aims to solve "various other issues that were impacting system stability and connectivity."</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cyzh41/android_14_qpr3_beta_22_now_available"> Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The current known issues with Beta 2 include an issue with sideloading the software, which has caused some devices to fail to boot properly. Additionally, the At a Glance widget may display the weather for the wrong location.</p><p>Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.2 is rolling out as an OTA (over-the-air) update for all previously mentioned supported Pixels. Google states it may take up to 24 hours before your device picks up the OTA update. If you&apos;re curious, you can hop into your <strong>Settings > System > System updates </strong>to see if your device is ready.</p><p>The last update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Beta 2.1</a> arrived on April 1. The company aimed to correct a host of bugs that plagued Pixel testers soon after installing the original Beta 2. Among the problems, Google corrected Pixel launcher crashes, an inability for the Pixel Tablet to charge with its dock, a Pixel Fold display issue, and more.</p>

This deal doesn&apos;t require a trade-in, and it cuts over $23 a month off of the normal installment price for the Razr Plus. This phone is also one of our favorites as far as flip or foldable phones go, sporting a beautiful cover display, quick performance, and pretty great charging speeds.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> is a verifiably premium foldable phone, and it's currently on sale at AT&T for $2.99 a month with a qualifying unlimited data plan. The deal doesn't even require a trade-in, and you can either add the phone to an existing unlimited data plan or start a new one.</p>
<p>The Razr Plus offers a performance-tier upgrade from the Razr, and this particular deal is for the black version of the phone. Perhaps best of all is the flip phone's beautiful cover display, offering a super useful interface that can even help improve battery life.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/motorola-razrplus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="32e0258e-ef3c-4eb2-b8ba-269d663ccd90" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$27.78/mo" data-dimension48="$27.78/mo">View Deal</a></p></div>

It has a stylish clamshell design that can be compared to a slim version of a Gameboy Advance SP (real ones know), and the hinge feels sturdy.</p><p>Plus, it&apos;s well-liked for its fluid movement between inner and outer screens, and its smooth, quick performance, as backed by the powerful Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor. It also comes with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, three microphones, and stereo speakers.</p><p>The Razr Plus admittedly doesn&apos;t have the best battery life, typically not even lasting a full day without needing to be charged. However, using the cover screen can offer some pretty substantial battery improvements, if you think that may help. And with installments of only $2.99 a month, you can&apos;t really go wrong with trying it out given its other positives.</p>

<ul><li>Garmin Venu Sq 2 owners were unable to download apps or watch faces in April and May.</li><li>Garmin eventually patched the problem in its "backend" after over a month of forum complaints. </li><li>Issues with fitness watches' firmware and updates have been on the rise in recent years, across brands. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitness watches get more post-launch updates than they used to. In theory, this is a good thing. In practice, brands like Garmin and Fitbit are struggling to keep up with their ambitious goals. </p><p>Earlier this week, a reader alerted me to an "aggravating" issue with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a>, one of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">favorite Garmin watches</a>. For the past month, no one with the Sq 2 or Music edition could connect to Connect IQ. That meant no Spotify, Komoot, new watch faces, or any other third-party apps. Weeks after the issue arose, Garmin Support opened a ticket, then went radio silent, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/healthandwellness/f/venu-sq-2/367841/unable-to-download-any-app-on-garmin-venu-sq2-music-edition/" target="_blank">frustrating forum users</a> who began threatening to return their Venus. </p><p>Then, shortly after sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Venu-Sq-2-Garmin-acknowledges-app-and-watch-face-installation-issues-allegedly-caused-by-firmware-update.840339.0.html">Notebook Check</a> began reporting on the issue, Garmin engineers "fixed an error in the backend" that had prevented Venu Sq 2 watches and the Garmin servers from communicating. Users agreed that the issue had been fixed without any update on their end; some asked what the holdup had been before the thread was closed. </p><p>The Venu Sq 2 is a kind of gateway product for Garmin. Its relatively affordable price and lightweight squircle design make it an easier transition for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> users or fans of other cheap fitness watches, who might find other Garmins too rugged, expensive, or niche. So for new Venu Sq 2 owners — especially those that paid $50 extra for music storage — to lack access to apps for over a month is a big deal.</p>

<p>Garmin has also faced complaints in the past couple of months about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-update-1822-adds-great-features-but-introduces-heart-rate-issues">Garmin Forerunner update</a> with an accidental side effect: it allegedly caused watches&apos; optical HR sensors to underestimate heart rate data significantly. </p><p>In my case, I&apos;ll notice during hard track runs with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> that my heart rate is about 30–40 bpm too low for a lap or so before it autocorrects. Otherwise, it performed very well in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Garmin vs. Coros vs. Polar test</a> for heart rate, but unfortunately, other users still report unresolved issues with high or low HR more regularly, even months later. </p><p>While these longstanding issues don&apos;t look great for Garmin, I&apos;ll note that buggy software updates with inadvertent consequences seem to be a worrying trend with fitness watches and trackers recently. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gJEjw8hCxLdEDup98vwxhG" name="fitbit-charge-5-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 Lifestyle 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gJEjw8hCxLdEDup98vwxhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>I immediately remembered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-5-update-allegedly-bricking-wearables-google-denies">Fitbit Charge 5 fiasco</a> earlier this year: Fitbit updated the Charge 5 with new clock faces and languages, with the unintended side effect of overworking the Charge 5 battery to the point that users reported the 7-day fitness tracker could only last half a day at most. A month later, tech sites caught wind of the issue; Fitbit said the update wasn&apos;t to blame without explaining why Charge 5 trackers broke after factory resets or could no longer track sleep. </p><p>I&apos;m not certain if this problem was ever resolved. At the time, Google gave users 50% discounts for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Charge 6</a> replacement, but many long-time Fitbit fans swore off the brand for good. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-orthostatic-test-result.jpeg" alt=""Test result: your cardio system is recovered" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I positively reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, it too had a rough start. My review unit would crash during any long hiking or running activity, causing a boot loop that would only end when the battery ran out or I found a way to factory reset it. Other reviewers and day-one buyers reported similar issues.</p><p>The latest firmware updates did nothing to resolve the problem, so Polar sent me a new watch. This unit never crashed once in the month or so I used it. The fact remains, however, that Polar couldn&apos;t find a way to resolve this major software issue remotely. Then it delayed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-grit-x2-pro-launch">Polar Grit X2 Pro launch</a> to take more time resolving firmware issues.</p><p>No matter which fitness brand you prefer, you&apos;re more likely to run into serious software issues these days. I suspect there&apos;s one clear culprit: ambition. </p>
<h2 id="too-many-watches-not-enough-support-2">Too many watches, not enough support</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="u4fZiakWkjhXjsRFHdHV6i" name="Garmin-watches-HERO.jpeg" alt="A bunch of Garmin watches sitting on a table: The Venu 3, Forerunner 965, 955, 265, and 255 Music, Instinct 2 Solar and 2X Solar, and Vivomove Trend." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4fZiakWkjhXjsRFHdHV6i.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We&apos;re seeing a trend today where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-and-fitness-watches-tried-stealing-each-others-tricks-in-2023">fitness watches are trying to become smartwatches</a> to compete with mainline smartwatches. Because of that, brands like Garmin and Fitbit are dedicating more effort to post-launch updates to keep their watches relevant for years — just as a Galaxy or Apple Watch gets three or four years of feature updates and support.</p><p>Mainline smartwatches also have more powerful CPUs, more resources, and fewer models. If Samsung wants to test a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> feature, it must check the Galaxy Watch 4, 5, 5 Pro, and 6. That&apos;s not unreasonable for such a massive company. </p><p>Garmin sells <em>dozens</em> of watches at any given moment. Even if they share the same general software and UI, a $1,000 Fenix has more powerful capabilities than a $250 Venu Sq 2. So, each watch gets its own updates and (presumably) requires its own QA testing with every new feature update. </p><p>Most other fitness brands take a similar multi-device approach. Amazfit sells about 20 smartwatches, not counting its older models, which still receive support. Google and Fitbit have about 10 products combined. COROS only has four watches but still updates watches released years ago with brand-new software like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-adds-turn-by-turn-navigation-watch-faces-more">turn-by-turn navigation</a>. </p><p>With so many watches on the market at once, made by brands with smaller teams, bugs are bound to slip through the cracks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RrydbCbKoH4UkGrhdokiYc" name="garmin-venu-sq-2-watch-face-on-wrist.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu Sq 2 watch face at breakfast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrydbCbKoH4UkGrhdokiYc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin&apos;s forums are full of bug reports; some are specific to one broken watch, and others are down to user error. So when a <em>real</em>, widespread bug shows up, like the Venu Sq 2&apos;s app block or the Forerunners&apos; HR inaccuracies, the support team will respond with canned advice until enough people yell about it for them to escalate the issue. And even then, it may take time to find a proper solution. </p><p>Again, this isn&apos;t about Garmin specifically. Other brands might have taken longer to acknowledge the problem, or fail to pin down the problem&apos;s cause. It&apos;s about the fact that these brands used to launch a product and then move on to the next one, rarely adding more than a few new features after launch. That made it easier to avoid bugs. </p><p>Now that users expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-brands-need-to-guarantee-proper-software-updates">proper post-launch software update</a>, for fitness watches, these brands have to squeeze features onto chips that were optimized at launch for as much battery life as possible. In some cases, that&apos;s likely to cause problems, and athletes with a previously functional watch have to spend weeks waiting for a solution. And with so many watches on the market, you never know if yours will slip through the cracks. </p>

<ul><li>Ahead of the anticipated July Unpacked event, the first renders of Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra have popped up on the web.</li><li>They reveal an all-new squarish design on the outside while the watch retains the same circular display as the predecessor models.</li><li>The additions include a new third button, a prominent speaker grille, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s next Galaxy smartwatches are among the highly anticipated products we expect to arrive alongside new foldable phones at the next Unpacked event, which is in July. However, the first high-quality renders of the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra surfaced online ahead of the release, showing Samsung is playing with a new design for its flagship watch.</p><p>The leak comes from Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks, in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch7-ultra-5k-renders-say-hello-to-squarish-design/">SmartPrix</a>. It reveals the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra from all sides next to its new design. The notable changes comprise a mix of circular and squarish designs, with a circular display nestled into a square chassis. At first glance, the design certainly appears distinct from the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> series and previous Wear OS models from Samsung.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Squarish or rounded, seems they were not able to decide and the result is… Well, see by yourself with today’s very first look at the #Samsung #GalaxyWatch7Ultra through stunning 5K renders!On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/SPHPEW9TCd pic.twitter.com/Lo8aMDQV7R<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1793906724254241006">May 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>According to the tipster, the display will measure 1.5 inches in diameter, similar to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Coming to the dimensions, it will bear 47 x 47.14 x 16.4mm — a tad bit bigger than the previous Classic model and a likely result of the seemingly bulkier design. Interestingly, it seems the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra retains the popular rotating bezel despite the changes, continuing the trend of Samsung&apos;s Classic watch models. Subtle lines around the display also replace the numeric indicators as part of the new design.</p><p>Another new addition is a third button on the side amid the traditional two buttons we see on Samsung smartwatches. It is believed to be a new action button with functionalities similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the look, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra has undergone other significant alterations. At the rear is a new circular array of health sensors, including a temperature sensor that seems to have been shifted slightly from its previous location, per the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.</p><p>SmartPrix further notes there are two button-like elements next to the sensor array, which are likely triggers to detach the watch bands. Previously, the watch bands themselves included ways to detach from the smartwatch. Another notable change is the addition of new large speaker grills placed at the left pane of the smartwatch.</p><p>All in all, the design changes and the new additions to the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra appear promising, to say the least. As we near the possible July Unpacked event, we expect more details of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, including the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> models from Samsung, to pop up soon.</p>

<p>In what should come as a surprise to absolutely no one, Humane is reportedly looking to sell. The same can&apos;t yet be said for Rabbit, but no matter what, don&apos;t buy what these companies are telling you. I did, at least with the Rabbit R1, and it&apos;s looking more and more like I was finally bamboozled.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been pretty skeptical about devices like the Humane AI Pin and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a>. After all, what&apos;s the point when my phone, or smartwatch, is capable of doing almost everything these devices aim to deliver? While I never thought twice about getting the AI Pin, I <em>did</em> buy the R1, mainly because the design looks cool. It also helps that the R1 is $199, without a monthly subscription, while Humane charges $699 and then you have to pay another $25 per month.</p><p>Although done in different ways, ultimately, both the AI Pin and R1 essentially aim to become their own AI-powered virtual assistant. With the former, there&apos;s a bunch of cool and unique tech built-in, as you can use your voice or via the "Laser Ink" display that appears in the palm of your hand. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">for the latter</a>, it&apos;s more like a phone in that you still have to take it out of your pocket and press the "push-to-talk" button before you can start to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JtN94fiqctZgVURWBaJqw4" name="humane-press-interactions.png" alt="AI pin projection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtN94fiqctZgVURWBaJqw4.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Humane)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s definitely an argument to be made about how the AI Pin is the "better" option of the two. It lets you "enjoy the world around you," without cranking your neck down to look at your phone while trying to find the closest coffee shop.</p><p>But, I&apos;m not here to talk about how one is better than the other. I&apos;m here because I can&apos;t help but feel like I&apos;ve been scammed for the first time.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOHf20slZg">Coffeezilla video</a> above appeared on my YouTube home page, and I was both excited and terrified. Coffeezilla has a reputation for doing some of the best investigative work on YouTube, covering everything from largely focusing on different types of crypto scams and "get rich quick" schemes.</p><p>I never really got into the crypto game, outside of messing around with it in small quantities a few years ago. But, when seeing the thumbnail of the Rabbit R1, I knew it wasn&apos;t going to be good. And so far, it hasn&apos;t been.</p><p>It appears as though this isn&apos;t the first time that Rabbit CEO, Jesse Lyu, has been in some sort of spotlight. According to Coffeezilla, Rabbit was previously called "Cyber Manufacture," and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/Synergis_and_Collab_Currency_Lead_6M_in_a_Pre_Series_A_Round_for_Cyber_Manufacture_Co_the_Studio_Behind_Next_Generation_NFT_Project_GAMA/prweb18346003.htm" target="_blank">raised $6 million</a> in relation to its "next-generation NFT project GAMA."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rabbit went viral at the beginning of this year, raising $30m in venture capital and selling $20m in consumer products.But most people don't know that the company Rabbit Inc used to be called Cyber Manufacture Co, and raised $6 million for an NFT project. This project was WILD pic.twitter.com/1aQXTSVysu<a href="https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1792962211264245943">May 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Using our trusty friend, the Wayback Machine, I pulled up the old GAMA website. In a snapshot from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230410171154/https://gama.io/" target="_blank">April 2023</a>, the front page shows GAMA as being described as "building the principles of the future through its next generation metaverse, the GAMA Space Station." This included creating "GAMA Coin" which Lyu describes as being "basically Bitcoin 2.0." </p><p>Lyu goes on to say "So the general concept is, let&apos;s say if you own a GAMA NFT, that means you own the equal portion in valuation of your NFT&apos;s, at that moment of that clean energy grid that we started building in the real world. [...] And that also means that you own that portion of that power and that power will be used to generate GAMA Coins. That means you can earn your GAMA Coins out of this entire clean energy cycle."</p><p>Phew. </p><p>Since GAMA has vanished, what happened to those who bought NFT&apos;s, believing in GAMA&apos;s mission? At the time, Jesse Lyu is quoted as saying "And I better pay my money to collect your NFT back if you think this is just a NFT hype and dump project, I have to say that." </p><p>As it turns out, that last part never happened. In response to the Coffeezilla video, Rabbit provided the following:</p><p>"The "coin you refer to never materialized nor was it promised or delivered. The idea was brought up during some conversations with both major investors and community members. The team ultimately decided to not release any "coins." Jesse and the GAMA team have never released cryptocurrency or "coins in any form. The only ownership objects community members could own are blockchain-based digital art and unique gaming avatars."</p><p>In response to Coffeezilla&apos;s questions regarding the relationship between GAMA and Rabbit, a statement says "GAMA, in our opinion and as stated in the fact sheet, has no connection with rabbit."</p><p>You can go further down the <del>rabbit</del> GAMA hole, but it all just reads like the various crypto and NFT scams that promise the world, take your money, and disappear into the night. This is where my skepticism comes into play.</p><p>Android Central subsequently also reached out to the company about the investigation, and a spokesperson for Rabbit provided the following:</p><p><em>"The GAMA project concluded when it was open-sourced. Jesse strongly disputes Coffeezilla’s allegations that he and the GAMA team were not forthright about the open sourcing of the project, which had the support of investors, and his shift in focus to AI hardware. Jesse has a long history as an entrepreneur and has been involved in a range of projects over his career, including the GAMA NFT project. It’s a project he has talked about at length in the past, but it ended before he started rabbit. At the end of the day, many companies do pivot."</em></p>
<h2 id="overpromise-under-deliver-2">Overpromise, under-deliver</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cZfxNYTtf5aZVGwbJiu7aR" name="rabbit-r1-services-launch-video.png" alt="Teased services during Rabbit R1 launch video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZfxNYTtf5aZVGwbJiu7aR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1991" height="1120" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rabbit / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s very similar to what tech companies have done for years: promising things to its customers, taking their money for devices, and then either delaying or never shipping the promised features.</p><p>Funnily enough, it&apos;s exactly the same thing that Rabbit has done with the R1. When the R1 was introduced, it was promised to basically act as a "bridge" between you and the different services you rely on. During the launch video, you briefly see a glimpse of different services, including Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Postmates, and more.</p><p>What&apos;s actually available now with the R1 pales in comparison. And in many cases, things just don&apos;t work. Sure, it&apos;s cool to be able to point the R1&apos;s camera at something and have it tell you what it is. You can even set up MidJourney, an AI image generator, as one of the services and then ask the R1 to create images with just your voice. Well, that is, if it actually works. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD" name="rabbit-r1-midjourney-fail.jpg" alt="Rabbit R1 Midjourney fail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5ohzTSPgZ7LQfdqiKBrSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s the thing, though, that rectangle in your pocket can already do that. Plus, a few of the features shown off during the R1 launch video are still missing. The list of "planned" additions includes the likes of "point-of-interest research," "navigation," and "reservations."</p><p>Not to mention that when the R1 arrived, many early adopters couldn&apos;t even change their time zone. Even with built-in Wi-Fi, GPS, and cellular, the time zone remained the same. It wasn&apos;t until about a week later before a software update fixed that specific issue.</p><p>However, I have to give credit where credit is due. </p><p>Since its launch, the R1 has received five software updates "directly addressing customer feedback and launching new features." The most recent of which includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1793742658617393309">seven new features</a>, such as a new "list view," and the ability to "take pictures on r1 with a single click of the ptt button." There are also five fixes "thanks to rabbit community support," primarily focused on network and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">https://t.co/u1e4euNjjJ<a href="https://twitter.com/rabbit_hmi/status/1793742658617393309">May 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>When speaking to Rabbit, a spokesperson informed me that there are about "10,000 or so" R1 owners in the wild. Of that number, R1 owners "have generated more than 600,000 interactions over the past thirty days." The spokesperson went on to tell me that it&apos;s "being used for more than 20,000 queries per day."</p><p>While the number of units might seem like peanuts compared to the number of phones that are being sold, it&apos;s not an insignificant amount. Let alone that the R1 resides in a new product category.  </p>
<p>Learning about the alleged origins of Rabbit as a company, paired with what we&apos;ve seen so far, didn&apos;t leave me feeling great about the future. But then, OpenAI kind of put both Humane and Rabbit on notice.</p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-no-escaping-ai-2">There&apos;s no escaping AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB" name="Google-IO-2024-ai-count.jpeg" alt="AI count of 121 at Google I/O" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everywhere we look, the phrase "AI" is being used, even if it&apos;s being done improperly. Hell, Google CEO Sundar Pichai even called it out at the end of the I/O 2024 Keynote. Of course, in some instances, it&apos;s just a buzzword that companies are using to try and score SEO points and jump on the hype train, or worse, entice investors.</p><p>However, companies like Google and OpenAI are taking a different approach to the AI-powered digital assistant. The day before I/O 2024 began, OpenAI held an event where it introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">GPT-4o</a>.</p><p>This is a new AI model basically does everything that the R1 and AI Pin promised. That includes using it to "answer questions about your surroundings, talk to you with audio, and respond to text." All from an app on your phone. OpenAI even managed to improve the response speed with GPT-4o, down to 232 milliseconds from the previous 320 milliseconds average response time.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to GPT-4o, our new flagship model which can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time: https://t.co/MYHZB79UqNText and image input rolling out today in API and ChatGPT with voice and video in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/uuthKZyzYx<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1790072174117613963">May 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The real kicker for Humane and Rabbit is that OpenAI wasted no time getting this into the hands of consumers. Its improved text and image capabilities were available for everyone in ChatGPT on the day GPT-4o was announced. Meanwhile, ChatGPT Plus members received access to Voice Mode "in alpha."</p><p>Then, Google followed up the next day with what felt like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">the longest I/O Keynote in history</a>. Upgrades were announced across the board, with Gemini gaining multimodality, making it possible to "provide reason for images and videos uploaded" to the model.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">all ai pins internally + a small number externally are now running gpt-4o! still early, but so far lots of great improvements:14% decrease in latency28% shorter answers33% fewer bad answersbeyond the numbers, everything just feels smarter and more accurate (as expected) pic.twitter.com/H3Y6MGsOc0<a href="https://twitter.com/GK3/status/1790171601398583524">May 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Google also gave everyone a tease by showing that those same multimodal capabilities would be coming to our phones. This will be possible via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini Nano</a> model, which is currently available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Both Gemini and ChatGPT have the added benefit of either "Extensions" or "GPTs," adding more functionality to these AI-powered assistants. And, any updates or changes that are implemented, are available as soon as these companies decide. Meanwhile, you&apos;ll have to wait for Humane or Rabbit to implement the changes, then likely wait for an update to arrive.</p><p>I asked Rabbit about what it envisioned for the future of the company and its little orange box. A Rabbit spokesperson provided the following:</p><p><em>“At rabbit, we stand behind our product, technology and vision to build a personalized operating system that can understand users’ intentions and intuitively help them get things done. We firmly believe that we are building something new in a frontier category and that it requires a different approach from the existing personal devices that are already in the market. AI-native products are quickly evolving and improving at exponential rates, and we are looking forward to what we can build in this new industry.”</em></p>

<p>Let&apos;s try and wrap everything up in a nice bow. Humane is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-ai-brand-humane-looking-to-sell-sources-say">looking to sell</a>, according to a report by Bloomberg. Ignoring the exorbitant asking price of something "between $750 million and $1 billion," it was always going to come to this.</p><p>Any piece of hardware that is built with the intention of making AI easier to access will be doomed. Well, that&apos;ll be the case for as long as we&apos;re able to use the Gemini or ChatGPT apps on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>. They&apos;ll be updated faster, and the only "middle-man" we have to worry about is Apple with its App Store or Google with its Play Store.</p><p>While this is all alleged, I&apos;m incredibly disappointed in myself for falling into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-current-problem-with-tech-ai-devices-why-its-your-fault">rabbit trap</a>. I stepped right into it without looking at where I was going or what was going to happen on the other side. Now, I have a $200 prop that I&apos;ll use in pictures just because it looks so sleek, thanks to Teenage Engineering.</p><p>Unless someone at Rabbit reads this and turns it into a paperweight, I&apos;ll also keep trying out the R1 occasionally. Just to see if the company can prove me wrong. But, based on its history, I won&apos;t be holding my breath.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Realme’s front-runner for its latest 12 series is the 12 Pro+ 5G, and it’s easily the most interesting of the lot. While the company is most popularly known for its budget offerings, it does have a few mid-range models with unique features. The big highlight in this one, and why I was waiting to get my hands on it, is a periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a maddening 120x of digital zoom. </p><p>This is a longer zoom range than even what Samsung offers on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. While the real-world usefulness of such a high zoom level is debatable, the fact that we have a phone around $400 that packs similar telephoto camera tech as phones above $1,000, is a feat in itself. </p><p>And if you think Realme has had to compromise in other areas in order to sell it at such a low price, you’d be wrong. The 12 Pro Plus 5G packs a flagship-grade main camera, a curved-edge 120Hz AMOLED display, IP65 rating, and a massive battery with very fast charging. So, is there a catch or could this be the best bargain in its segment? Time to find out. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FhUGTVVYXbQwsQXTufpHuh" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_2.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ vegan leather back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FhUGTVVYXbQwsQXTufpHuh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G starts at ₹29,999 (around $360) in India, but it’s also available in other markets like Malaysia and Philippines. The base model comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The higher storage variant with 256GB is priced at ₹31,999 ($383), while the top-variant comes with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage for ₹33,999 ($407). </p><p>Realme tends to have perpetual discounts for the upper tier variants if you buy it from its site, so it makes good sense to aim for either the top or second-top variant. It also has plenty of cashback and banking offers, and is even bundling the Realme Buds 2 Neo TWS earphones with any purchase. </p><p>This top model in the 12 series also has a more exciting choice of colors, compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/realme-12-plus-5g-review"><u>Realme 12 Plus 5G</u></a>. The Navigator Beige trim that I received looks classy, but I’d much rather have bolder shades like the Submarine Blue or Explorer Red (more like orange, going by the press photos). </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z6VJeK2nBWUwwikkZ9omb3" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_7.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ camera dial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z6VJeK2nBWUwwikkZ9omb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you liked the design language of the 12 Plus 5G, then you’ll certainly love 12 Pro Plus 5G too. In fact, this model feels a bit more premium thanks to a sturdier frame, and curved edges on the back and the display. The faux-leather finish feels great to hold, and it adds to the grip while keeping fingerprints at bay. The circular camera module embodies a luxury watch design, which is a running theme with the 12 series. The Pro model has an added decorative gold ring around the rear camera dial, for a bit of flair. </p><p>The phone feels slim to hold at 8.75mm, and has just the right heft so it doesn’t feel toy-like. The buttons are clicky, speaker grills are placed well so your hands don’t accidentally block them, and you get a dual-SIM slot. There’s no microSD support, so storage is not extendable. The 12 Pro Plus 5G gets a nifty IP65 rating for dust and water resistance. </p>

<p>The other great thing about the Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G is the display. It’s a large 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with a Full HD+ resolution. It produces rich colors and can get very bright. Viewing content even under direct hard sunlight was not an issue. You get an in-display fingerprint sensor too which is quick, but the face unlock is the quickest way to get to your apps. </p><p>The curved edges on either side of the display gives you the feeling of using a much more expensive phone. The display also gets a 120Hz refresh rate, which scales to 90Hz or 60Hz based on the app or your interaction with the screen. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, which is peppy and does a good job of handling all your typical social and productivity apps. Multitasking was a breeze on the 12GB model that I tested, and I feel it should be a similar experience on the lower variants too. HDR videos looked good on this display and the stereo speakers provided an engaging experience. </p><p>Battery life is especially good thanks to the 5,000mAh capacity, which easily lasts for about a day and half on medium to heavy workloads. There’s no wireless charging, but wired charging is a quick 67W with the bundled adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lvkwv52KB96QCvbwRFjCKL" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_3.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lvkwv52KB96QCvbwRFjCKL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the main reasons you should consider this phone is for the cameras. The 12 Pro Plus features the 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor for the main camera, which is also found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, while the telephoto is the OmniVision OV64B 64MP sensor as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. Both sensors are optically stabilized and offer superb clarity, colors, and details in both daylight and night time shots.</p><p>The primary camera’s wide f/1.8 aperture ensures a creamy bokeh effect in close-up photos, while in low light, the app automatically takes a long-exposure shot. The telephoto or Portrait camera as Realme calls it, is equally impressive. It has a 3x optical zoom, which has good stabilization when you’re framing. Image quality is quite impressive even at 10x magnification. However, there are diminishing returns as you go beyond 20x zoom. At the maximum 120x level, large text on distant objects is just about recognizable but it’s clear that the camera is well beyond its comfort zone.</p>

<p>Video recording maxes out at 4K30 on the Realme 12 Pro Plus. Image quality is quite good during the day and you have the ability to switch between the ultra-wide, primary, and telephoto cameras when recording at 1080p. The primary and tele can shoot at 4K, but you have to choose which sensor you want before you hit record. </p><p>The 32MP selfie camera is equally impressive, capturing sharp and detailed images in daylight and indoor lighting. The post-processing works well in cleaning up noise, and the default skin smoothing filter isn’t too aggressive and produces pleasing portraits. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-realme-12-pro-plus-5g-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9V2GvAZdYFMS2ugiwEf37b" name="Realme-12-Pro-Plus-5G_4.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Pro+ ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9V2GvAZdYFMS2ugiwEf37b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus 5G doesn’t have a macro camera or even a macro shooting mode, which some might miss. Realme could have completed the trifecta by using a more substantial ultrawide camera with autofocus. This would have helped in getting sharper photos as well as enabled macro photography. This is the only rear camera that can’t record at 4K resolution, which I feel was a missed opportunity.</p><p>The other area which could have used a better upgrade is the SoC itself. Don’t get me wrong, it works just fine in day-to-day use but it’s not as powerful as some of the others in this segment. Going by benchmark numbers, it put out nearly the same scores or just slightly better numbers than the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, which sits in Realme’s much cheaper 12 Plus 5G. We  also could have gotten better features like 4K at 60fps video recording on the 12 Pro Plus 5G, had Realme used a more potent processor. </p>
<p>The last complaint with this phone has been a recurring one on most Realme phones, and that’s the software. Realme UI 5.0 is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and my unit received multiple updates for Android security patches and bug fixes, which is good to see. But there’s no getting around how unnecessary bloated it feels, with tons of needless apps and many first-party ones that bombard you with unsolicited notifications. You can work around this by being careful during setup and not giving permission to certain apps, but it’s still a hassle which we shouldn’t have to deal with. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Pro Plus’s biggest competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus</a>. It sits in a similar price range, and boasts of better water resistance, a higher-resolution AMOLED display, and quicker charging. Between the two, I’d still put my money on the 12 Pro Plus 5G simply because of the better auxiliary cameras and due to the fact that it comes with Android 14 out of the box. </p><p>The Vivo V30 is another phone that competes in this segment, featuring an equally eye-catching design as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">more expensive sibling</a>, good quality rear cameras, 80W charging, and a more powerful SoC. It does miss out on a telephoto camera though, which is the big highlight of the Realme 12 Pro Plus. </p><p>For those in the U.S., it&apos;s still hard to beat the Pixel 7a at its current price. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> is very new, and will eventually replace the 7a as our go-to recommendation once it gets a decent deal. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a versatile telephoto camera with good zoom range </li><li>You want a stylish mid-range phone  </li><li>You want long-lasting battery life </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want clutter-free user interface </li><li> You want strong gaming performance </li><li> You need wireless charging  </li></ul>
<p>Realme continues to deliver great value even with its mid-range offerings, and the 12 Pro Plus 5G is a good example. For what it costs, the phone truly excels in the camera department thanks to a strong primary sensor, versatile telephoto camera, and a solid selfie camera. Realme doesn&apos;t stop there though, as it delivers an equally premium usage experience thanks to a faux-leather back panel and the luxury-watch inspired rear modules. Performance is also decent, the phone is water and dustproof, and the battery easily lasts more than a day. The vivid curved-edge AMOLED display is excellent for binge-watching on the move.</p><p>The typical software hurdles continue to haunt Realme phones, as the interface is too cluttered and bloated with needless apps. The ultrawide camera is also nothing special, when compared to how good the other cameras are. Lastly, there&apos;s the processor itself, which would have been perfectly decent on a phone at around $300, but not at this price. If the 12 Pro Plus 5G isn&apos;t available where you live, here&apos;s a list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">great alternatives</a> that should work just as well. </p>

<ul><li>Meta is bringing Calm, Amazon Music and integrating Instagram stories with a new update to their Ray-Ban smart glasses.</li><li>These apps will be powered by Meta's Llama 3 AI model, giving users a hands-free experience without needing to reach for their phones.</li><li>The new update will be "rolling out gradually," according to the company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta announced on Monday, May 2, it is adding a host of new apps to the AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, keeping mindfulness, music, and social media at the center of this update. </p><p>Just a month ago, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gained new "powers" with Multimodal AI thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama 3</a> model, allowing users across the U.S. and Canada to use vocal commands, share views on a video call, and have hands-free control over Apple Music. Now, it has added Calm, Amazon Music, and Instagram stories to the mix of the already existing apps.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-smart-glasses-amazon-music-calm-instagram-new-styles/">press release states</a> that Meta has partnered with Calm to provide its users with hands-free guided meditation, mindfulness exercises, and self-care content. This feature can be particularly useful for people who have to quickly access the calm app on the go, get a moment to themselves, or deal with a stressful situation.  Users need to download the app and say, “hey, Meta, play the Daily Calm.” Follow the on-screen prompts in the Meta View app to get started. </p><p>Along with Apple Music, Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be integrated with Amazon Music. When users say, “Hey Meta, play Amazon Music,”  the glasses will start playing a recommended playlist. Users can then control audio playback with touch or voice commands, all hands-free while their phones stay in their pockets.</p><p>Finally, could there be an update from Meta that doesn&apos;t involve their social media platforms? Now, users can post Instagram stories just with a voice command without pulling out the phone. After users snap a photo/ record a video, say, “Hey Meta, share my last photo on Instagram.”  It also allows you to click and post a new picture on the go by saying, "Hey Meta, post a photo to Instagram," which instantly will open up camera mode and click a picture of what the user is looking at. </p><p>Meta says that these updates to the glasses will be "rolling out gradually" to its users. However, it remains unclear which countries these updates will be available in.</p>

These will be available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ca/smart-glasses/shop-all/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=ray-ban-smart-glasses-amazon-music-calm-instagram-new-styles">pre-order</a> in 15 countries starting at $369.99, including the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe.</p>
