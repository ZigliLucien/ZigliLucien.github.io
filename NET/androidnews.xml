<hr>
<p>Cellular services in the U.S. are mostly handled by a select few carriers, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a>. When you purchase or activate a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new phone</a> with a carrier, the smartphone can be "locked" to that carrier for a period of time. Essentially, this restriction prevents phones from being used with a competing carrier until they are "unlocked." As of now, the requirements governing when phones are locked — and how they can be unlocked — are set by each carrier individually. </p><p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) isn&apos;t thrilled with this arrangement, and is proposing an alternative. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A1.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> issued Thursday, July 18, the FCC explained how a change in unlocking rules could reduce customer confusion by introducing a standardized process. </p><p>"Currently, mobile service providers use a variety of unlocking policies—some abide by voluntary industry standards while others are subject to more stringent and enforceable unlocking requirements as a result of transaction commitments or rules specific to certain frequency bands," the FCC said. "This proposed rulemaking seeks to ensure the customers of all mobile service providers can expect the same baseline of unlocking standards and resources."</p><p>Under the proposed set of rules, all cellular carriers would be required to unlock devices within 60 days of their activation. The move is intended to increase competition, as it would be easier to switch from one carrier to another. In some cases, phones currently need to be unlocked manually through a customer request. Manually needing to ask cellular carriers like AT&T or T-Mobile is a significant obstacle to making the switch to another alternative. </p><p>However, this proposal isn&apos;t going to take effect anytime soon. For now, the FCC is merely issuing what is known as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The agency is making its proposal known and will seek comments and feedback on the proposed rule changes. For example, it wants to know whether a potential rule change should be applied to existing contracts or future contracts and how it would affect carrier deals and promotions. </p><p>This is a significant hurdle to overcome because most carriers today will not unlock a device until it is completely paid off. Installment plans from cellular carriers can last as long as 36 months today. It&apos;s already difficult to pay off your phone early because doing so may result in losing promotional credits or discounts. If the FCC&apos;s 60-day requirement doesn&apos;t apply until after phones are completely paid off, this proposed policy may not have as much of an impact. </p><p>These are just a few things that the FCC wants feedback about during the public comment period. The conversation will be extensive, and I&apos;d guess there will be some carrier pushback. After this public comment period, the proposed rule can continue to the drafting and revising stages. In other words, it will be quite a while before these potential unlocking requirements actually start making a difference at the consumer level. </p>

<p>The FCC plainly states that this move is intended to reduce confusion, and that&apos;s exactly what we need in the cellular industry. In some cases, cellular carriers already allow their devices to be unlocked within or after a 60-day activation period. However, these requirements are inconsistent and aren&apos;t consumer-friendly. </p><p>For example, AT&T&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/legal/modal/idpassets/fragment/legal/prod/legalmodal/support/smallbusinesskms/km125/km1258553.html" target="_blank">unlocking requirements</a> include eight bullet points and an additional disclaimer, with some legalese in the mix. For the most part, AT&T permits device unlocking after 60 days as long as customers have paid their device and service bills. Unfortunately, the requirements aren&apos;t stated as plainly in the official requirements. The confusing policies and the need to manually request to have a device unlocked may be enough to prevent people from unlocking their phones altogether. </p><p>Somehow, despite multiple competition inquiries into mergers and acquisitions over the years, we&apos;re left with three major cellular carriers in the U.S. Customers need to choose between AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. The smaller brands are limited, and are often owned by one of those three conglomerates. In the rare event that an independent or regional carrier is still privately owned, they usually operate on one of the major networks anyway. Basically, there is little incentive for users to choose anything but one of the three major carriers.</p><p>And due to the swath of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-i-know-whether-my-phone-unlocked">complicated unlocking requirements in place today</a>, it&apos;s not easy to switch between them. So, some users end up feeling stuck with the major carrier they chose in the first place. It&apos;s easy to see why this is a problem, especially as more and more people buy new smartphones via carrier contracts and promotional installment plans. </p><p>The system has arguably been broken for a long time, but perhaps the FCC can make a step in the right direction by standardizing unlocking rules. Under the new proposal, users can expect the same experience regardless of which carrier they use, and won&apos;t have to manually request for their devices to be unlocked. </p>

<p><strong>Carlos asks: </strong></p><p><em><strong>Why does Google send out monthly updates and new features so slow[ly]? Every time I read about a Pixel drop I have to wait for it and I&apos;d like to know the reason why.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thank you guys for everything you do!</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Carlos! I feel you and this is a super frustrating thing that a lot of folks — me included — impatiently go through every time Google announces anything different and new for the phone in our hands. It&apos;s also nothing new and no matter how much we hate it, Google has a really good reason for doing it this way.</p><p>I always front-load the answer so nobody has to read past the first few paragraphs, and this time the answer is really easy: </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-microsoft-windows-outage-disrupts-services-globally"><strong>Huge Microsoft Windows outage disrupts services globally</strong></a></p><p>This is what happens when you send out an update to everyone at the same time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664" name="windows-blue-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A blue screen of death on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was readying this article when last Friday&apos;s Microsoft outage happened and the timing couldn&apos;t have been better. I want to make it clear that Microsoft had nothing to do with thousands of Windows Servers crashing Friday morning and the update that broke everything came from a third-party software vendor named CrowdStrike that provides Windows Server security services. In the end, it didn&apos;t matter because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/next-microsoft-outage-could-affect-you">a single bad update caused global chaos</a> when it went out to everyone at once.</p><p>Google tries to prevent this from happening by slowly rolling out software changes and monitoring what effect they have on the folks who have received them.</p>
<p>It&apos;s been this way since the beginning. Back in 2014 Google Executive Dan Morrill, one of the most recognizable Android developers and part of the original Android team at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1r1dz4/44_kitkat_has_started_rolling_out_on_the_n4/cdiwt6f/">explained why it&apos;s done and how</a>.</p><p>"<em>Rollouts are conducted in phases. Typically they start at 1% of devices for around 24 - 48 hours; we watch the return rates and resulting device check-ins and error reports (if any), and make sure nothing looks wrong before sending it to more. Then typically it goes to 25%, 50%, 100% over the course of a week or two.</em>"</p>
<p>Google knows that no matter how much it tests a new piece of software there is a chance it will break things once it&apos;s released to everyone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">an Android phone</a>. Pixel phones (in this case) aren&apos;t very popular but many of the changes in the monthly update for them are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">incorporated into Android itself</a>, with the potential to reach almost every phone around the world.</p><p>By slowly pushing out a change, and then waiting to see if it breaks anything, the damage is minimized. There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-exposure-bug">botched software rollouts</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pauses-its-messy-december-pixel-6-update-until-late-january">Plenty of them</a>. In most cases, the software was quickly recalled, and whatever caused the problem was fixed, tested, and then slowly rolled out again to make sure it worked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hRtbsHDinAjqyfCvin7BNa" name="Google-Pixel-6-Pro-android-beta-05.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro with red white and blue wallpaper and Android Beta warning message" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hRtbsHDinAjqyfCvin7BNa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is standard practice from Google, Apple, Samsung, and almost every other company that makes phones and tablets. Software is developed and tested in-house, then sent out to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">limited number of beta testers</a>, and once everything <em>seems</em> OK it&apos;s sent out slowly to gauge its performance. </p><p>This is also why I like to stress that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dont-install-android-15-dev-preview">most people really shouldn&apos;t install any beta software</a> on a device they want to use. It is expected that things will break and is an important part of this process.</p>
<p>it&apos;s frustrating to wait for anything you want to try. Especially when it gets hyped by Google and websites like Android Central. But it&apos;s a lot less frustrating that having a phone that stops working. Let&apos;s hope Google doesn&apos;t decide to stop the slow trollout of new software.</p>

<ul><li>A set of Pixel 9 Pro XL images might've confirmed some interesting specifications ahead of Google.</li><li>The device's fast boot menu states it features 16GB RAM, 256GB of storage, and Samsung's Exynos 5400 modem with satellite communication support.</li><li>Google has been developing its "Satellite SOS" feature for Pixels throughout Android 15's beta period, and rumors state that it was thanks to the Exynos 5400.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new set of alleged hands-on images purport consumers are in for a little out of the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>The trio of images were posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-9-pro-xl.4682499/">XDA Forums</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-9-pro-xl.4682499/" target="_blank">,</a> and the user claims that they are of an early Pixel 9 Pro XL (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/21/google-pixel-9-pro-modem-ram-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The device&apos;s fast boot mode highlights its 16GB of Samsung LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of Samsung storage. That&apos;s not all, as the internal specification page details an upgraded modem.</p><p>This appears to be confirmation that users will find Samsung&apos;s Exynos 5400 modem inside the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it launches.</p><p>The post cites the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/modem/exynos-modem-5400/">showcase of the modem</a>, which states the Exynos 5400 is based on the 3GPP Release 17. This means that the modem is capable of providing a "more advanced" 5G mobile experience. Additionally, the Exynos 5400 can reach maximum data throughput speeds of 14.7Gbps.</p><p>However, additional information explains the modem&apos;s support of NB-IoT and NR NTN for satellite communication. Samsung states that the Exynos 5400 can connect a user&apos;s mobile device to "Low Earth orbit" (LEO) satellites to "ensure" large data transmissions.</p>

<p>What&apos;s important about the RAM/storage information is that this device could be another Pixel 9 Pro XL variant. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/alleged-pixel-9-pro-live-photos-surface">previously rumored</a> that the Pixel 9 Pro and the XL share the same 16GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage specifications. The amount of RAM is already an increase from the Pixel 8&apos;s 12GB, however, this supposed introduction of more storage is a welcome sight, too.</p><p>Moreover, this clear look at the device&apos;s modem might put old rumors to bed. It&apos;s been rumored that the Pixel 9 series&apos; satellite communication support would exist thanks to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Exynos 5400 modem</a>.</p><p>The ever flow of Android 15 betas has continued to give us small glimpses at what Google has in store for its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>." A recent find in Beta 4 showed that the SOS service will share your name, email, phone number, location, and device information with 911 to offer assistance. Additionally, there&apos;s speculation that Google is planning to charge users for such emergency services after a brief free period.</p><p>We don&apos;t have much longer to wait as Google is preparing for a much earlier hardware event on August 13.</p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi debuts its first clamshell foldable phone, the Mix Flip, in China.</li><li>It has a prominent cover screen measuring 4.01 inches and a foldable screen measuring 6.86 inches.</li><li>The company has also released the Mix Fold 4 with a lighter design than the predecessor.</li><li>Both are powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and come with 67W fast charging support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After much anticipation, Xiaomi has finally unveiled its first clamshell foldable phone, the Mix Flip, for the Chinese market. If the company chooses to make it widely available in other regions, it could be a significant rival to the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6. </p><p>While Xiaomi has been in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> business for quite some time now, the company took its sweet time to bring the clamshell phone, which looks interesting with a large cover screen, significantly larger than the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Xiaomi is calling it an All-Around Liquid display that measures 4.01 inches. It further comes with a higher refresh rate of up to 120Hz and has the company&apos;s Shield Glass protection. When unfolded, the clamshell phone features a 6.86-inch foldable screen with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz.</p>

<p>The bezels look thin, and the device uses an aluminum frame all around. The hinge is believed to be SGS-certified and can hold up to 500,000 folds. The Mix Flip also comes in interesting Black, Purple, White, and Xiaomi Nylon Fiber color options.</p><p>Underneath, the Mix Flip is powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and accompanied by 12GB RAM and 512GB of onboard storage. The full-screen cover display also incorporates two rear cameras: a 50MP primary lens and another 50MP telephoto lens—both of which carry the popular Leica branding like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>. The foldable display underneath carries a 32MP selfie shooter.</p><p>The clamshell phone also has a bigger battery capacity; it is 4780mAh and is further backed by a 67W fast charging. The other highlights of the device include a stereo speaker setup, Wi-Fi 7, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based Xiaomi&apos;s HyperOS operating system.</p>

<p>Xiaomi also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> competitor dubbed Mix Fold 4, which comes as the successor to Mix Fold 3. The latest book style features a lighter design, measuring 4.59mm when unfolded and 9.47mm when folded. Xiaomi says the hinge on the Fold 4 is also significantly lighter than the predecessor and yet stronger, and like the flippable phone, it will also withhold 500,000 folds.</p><p>The cover screen measures 6.56 inches and comes with Xiaomi Shield Glass protection. Its brightness can reach 3000 nits, and it has an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The foldable screen on the inside has the same functionalities, but it measures 7.98 inches and is made of ultra-thin glass (UTG).</p>

<p>The foldable phone is also powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 paired with VC liquid cooling. It features up to 16GB RAM and 1TB onboard storage and ships with HyperOS (Android 14). </p><p>For optics, the Mix Fold 4 also includes Leica integration and features a 50MP primary lens next to a 50MP telephoto lens, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and another 10MP periscopic lens.</p><p>A massive 5100mAh battery keeps the lights on both screens, and it also comes with 67W fast wired charging and 50W wireless charging. The other key takeaways of the book-style foldable phone include an IPX8 rating for dust resistance, Wi-Fi 7, support for HDR10+ content, and Surge battery management that promises to keep the battery life a bit higher even with those fast charging speeds.</p>

<p>Both new foldables are available in the China region for now, and we hope that Xiaomi will increase its new handset presence outside of China as well. The 12GB+256GB variant of the handset retails CNY 8999, 16GB+512GB costs CNY 9,999, and the larger 16GB+1TB model is set at CNY 10,999. The book-style foldable will be available in White, Black, and Blue colorways next to a fiber edition.</p><p>Meanwhile, the debutant Mix Flip costs CNY 5999 for 12+256GB, CNY 6499 for 12GB+512GB, and CNY 7299 for the larger 16GB+1TB storage variant.</p>

<ul><li>Oura has sent a new product for certification, which appears to be the Ring 4.</li><li>The device features model number "OA11" and is being tested in sizes ranging from seven to fifteen with a completely smooth design.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring debuted on July 10 and has quickly sold out, though Oura's chief marketing officer stated Samsung's entry was "validation" for the brand.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Oura is wasting no time in welcoming more smart ring competition as it starts certifying its next iteration.</p><p>Oura was spotted uploading images for a new product certification by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oura-ring-4-first-look-3463096/">Android Authority</a> and it&apos;s assumed to be the Ring 4. The company has listed a new device with the model number "OA11" and additional information provided seems to double down on the Ring 4 theory.</p><p>The device&apos;s product label states that OA11 is the "Oura Ring 4" alongside other details like a gold hue and a size 15. In other areas, the listing states Oura is testing its next ring in sizes seven, nine, thirteen, and fifteen.</p>

<p>The provided images show that Oura may not change its design language. An angled top-down view of the ring shows that Oura might provide a completely round and smooth wearable this time. The publication states that the ring captured above is a size 10.</p><p>The certification listing mentions a device with model number "OA12," as well. Further information about what that could be is unknown for now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura&apos;s Ring 3</a> from 2021 was mostly smooth and flat, however, the Heritage style variant featured a section that created a plateau. It&apos;s most likely a design choice to help users quickly know how to position the ring on their finger, as that flat portion is intended to sit atop your finger.</p><p>Additionally, the company offers the Ring 3 in sizes ranging from six to thirteen. The listing suggests Oura might look to increase its lowest and highest-size offerings. However, there&apos;s a chance that range could widen in either direction.</p><p>Oura&apos;s quick advance for a new product puts all eyes on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Ring — which only debuted two weeks ago and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">quickly sold out</a>. The Korean OEM&apos;s version mirrors its competitor with a smooth, rounded body and dimensions that help it stay in contention. Samsung has the edge on weight as the Galaxy Ring tops out a 3g (depending on size) while the Oura Ring 3 hits 6g at most.</p><p>But let&apos;s not forget that Oura had started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-retail-amazon-samsung-competition">preparing to take on Samsung</a> in March when it published the Ring 3 on Amazon. The company&apos;s head also sees Samsung&apos;s entry as a "positive" thing, stating it gives Oura "validation."</p>

<ul><li>It seems that Samsung's global Galaxy Tab S10 Plus variant has appeared on Geekbench with important specification details.</li><li>The listing suggests the company will plug MediaTek's Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC into its next tablet generation instead of Qualcomm.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab S10 series is rumored to arrive "later this year," potentially in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With so much anticipation for Samsung&apos;s next tablet series, a recent discovery sheds light on a crucial internal specification.</p><p>Tech devices usually undergo a performance test, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-mediatek-dimensity-chip-globally/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> recently noticed the global version of the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus doing just that. What stands out in its results is the motherboard, which features the codename "GTS10U." It seems likely that this is MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus chipset, which launched in May.</p><p>Last year, Samsung featured Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 series</a>. Additionally, it&apos;s worth reiterating that the publication also spotted the U.S. variant of the Tab S10 Plus, also with the Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC.</p><p>Other details in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7010014">the test results</a> state the device will feature just over 10GB of RAM (likely to be interpreted as 12GB) and Android 14. For its ARM v8 CPU, the listing states the Tab S10 Plus will benefit from four cores at 2GHz, three cores at 2.8GHz, and one core at 3.4GHz. Samsung&apos;s next-gen Plus tablet scored 2,141 in its single-core test and a 5,533 multi-core test score.</p><p>It&apos;s speculated that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra will follow its Plus sibling in using MediaTek&apos;s chip instead of Qualcomm globally.</p>

<p>MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">launched the Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> SoC in May, which is a more powerful successor to the base version from 2023. The company touted the chip&apos;s swifter speed and improved AI processing as its high points. With an upgraded APU, the 9300 Plus is said to handle AI-based tasks, like LLMs from Meta or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s Gemini</a>, much easier. The chip features the same All Big-Core design as the base 9300.</p><p>This includes an Arm Cortex-X4 core at 3.4GHz and three non-prime Cortex-X4 cores at 2.85GHz. Moreover, the Arm Immortalis-G720 will help devices with ray-tracing capabilities when gaming.</p><p>The Tab S10 Plus appearing on Geekbench with its global variant seems to put to rest the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">previous speculation</a> of a dual-chip method from Samsung. Rumors claimed that Samsung was interested in plugging Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 into the Tab S10 in one set of regions and leaving MediaTek to handle the rest.</p><p>That same report also claims that the Korean OEM is dropping the base Tab S10 model so it can "focus" on the larger displays provided by the Plus and Ultra variants.</p><p>New rumors state Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">could roll out</a> its Galaxy Tab S10 series duo in October. The company might pair its tablet launch with the release of the Galaxy S24 FE.</p>

<ul><li>The July Google Play System update brings new features to several Android services.</li><li>With the latest updates, Android TV and Android WebView have improved security, privacy, and bug fixes.</li><li>Cross devices also gain improvements like the ability to join your phone's hotspot with your Google account-connected devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The July Google System updates have brought some significant new features to several Android devices, including the latest Play services, which were rolled out to devices early this month. However, as the search giant keeps updating over the month, here are some new changes in the recent Google System Release notes.</p><p>With the latest system update, Google has brought new security and privacy enhancements, including logging improvements to Android TV Core services with version 6.8.2. This has also been carried out on Android WebView. Bearing the v127 version, it added new developer features for Google and other third-party app developers. </p><p>They have the support functionality to showcase web content in their apps. However, as Google noted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">changelog</a>, some features are experimental and only available to certain users.</p>
<p>Google Play Services and the Google Play Store also saw some enhancements last week. The former, with a version of v24.28, comprised cross-device services, where users are allowed to connect to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>&apos;s hotspot from their tablet or any other Google account-connected device—eliminating the need to set them up again manually. As for the Play Store (v41.9), users can see more updates about the game directly from the developer for select game titles.</p><p>While these were the latest additions to Google System updates added last week, previous updates from early this month included bug fixes in account management-related services for Google Play services. </p><p>On the other hand, Play Store has allowed users to choose apps they like to improve their recommendations further. Regarding device connectivity, Google Play services have also added new developer features. Another security feature of Find My Device is that users can unlock their devices remotely with their respective phone numbers.</p><p>Additionally, users can control Google Play Services straight from the settings on their smartphone.

They hit all the right notes (pun intended) while offering tech that is competitive with other products at this price point. This year’s Galaxy Buds iteration features a complete redesign reminiscent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-airpods-android-device">Apple’s AirPods Pro, with a stem</a>, although I think what they offer overshadows the brouhaha over the Apple-inspired redesign. Let’s talk about that!</p>

<p>Available for preorder now in white or silver, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro delivery date has been pushed back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-delays-galaxy-buds-3-pro-shipments">due to some quality control issues</a>. Going to their site right now and trying to preorder, the page shows I can pick up a pair in one of my local Samsung stores on August 13th for $249.99. Having it shipped currently shows that the buds won&apos;t get to me until August 28th. We&apos;ll keep you posted as these QC issues shake out. </p><p>This price places them $50 below some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">top-performing ANC earbuds</a>, like Sony’s venerable WF-1000XM5 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra earbuds. However, the price is in line with other smartphone manufacturers, like Apple and their AirPods Pro.</p>

<p>Let’s deal with the white elephant in the room: AirPods. Previous generations of stemless Galaxy Buds fit in my ears just fine. AirPods and AirPods Pro, on the other hand, never have unless I added Comply foam ear tips to keep them from falling out. So when I found out I would be reviewing the newly redesigned Buds 3 Pro, I was less than enthusiastic. </p><p>From a microphone perspective, stems make sense, but even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC</a> doesn’t stay in my ears without Comply foam ear tips. However, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <em>do</em> stay in my ears just fine. In fact, they are <em>quite</em> comfortable, although when I get sweaty, their silicone ear tips dislodge a bit, diminishing the ANC. </p><p>Eventually, I’ll add Comply foam ear tips to make their fit more secure during exercise.</p>

<p>I have the Silver model for review. The case is small and easily pocketable, and I really like the look of the entire unit. I like the color-matched left and right, blue and orange pops of color. As a lover of swords, I find the blade-style stems quite cool in how they look and light up. For me, those lights are giving Tron, and I’m here for it.</p><p>Beyond the sound — we’ll get to that in a second — my favorite aspect of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is the Samsung ecosystem connectivity. For my review, I used them connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. The ability to control the most important features directly from the GW7 is wonderful. Getting notifications read in my ear from the S22 Ultra and being able to take advantage of the SSC codec makes the Buds 3 Pro experience a joy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AhpLGPvCGRdbQJMxFpqqcS" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-stem-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhpLGPvCGRdbQJMxFpqqcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The stem-based controls are easy to learn and responsive when in use. Pinching or holding the lower end of the stems switches noise controls by default, but they can be customized for the left and right sides. This includes the ability to deactivate pinch controls altogether.</p><p>The single/double/triple pinch media controls, which play/pause music or move forward/back a track, aren’t customizable but can also be deactivated. The ability to slide your finger along the stem to control volume is quite responsive without being easy to accidentally activate when you’re pinching and holding. I never had that happen during my time with the Buds 3 Pro.</p><p>There are also Voice Controls now that you can use without having to wake Bixby or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. Going into the app and activating voice controls allows you to control simple functions by saying things like "Play music," "Next song," or "Previous song." Though there aren&apos;t many commands available, they do provide enough options to control the most important music-listening interactions, and they work <em>very well!</em> I was highly impressed. </p>

<p>Let’s talk sound now. First, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro achieve their ultimate sonic form when paired with a newer Galaxy phone like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24</a> series device. As noted, I tested with an S22 Ultra, and the sound experience was excellent, and I could still experience Samsung’s proprietary Samsung Scalable Codec in action. The Buds 3 Pro are the first Galaxy Buds with a two-way speaker featuring a planar tweeter and dual amp, and when you combine that with the app’s EQ and 360 Audio, you get crisp, airy sound that still has powerful bass cannon tuning and satisfying mid-frequency punch.</p><p>Activating 360 Audio increases the soundstage but boosts high frequencies and upper mids at the expense of bass response, so I activated the equalizer and used the Bass Boost preset. I figured that out after playing around with all the settings for a while. With those settings and the new driver tech, the opening acapella intro to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” sounds as airy and big as it should be. Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” which is one of my favorite tracks to test how well stereo imaging is reproduced, sounds terrific through the Buds 3 Pro, which have an enjoyable musicality to them while also giving you a deep thumping bass response as that upright bass thumps in Mingus’ masterpiece.</p><p>Be careful, though, because with some vocal-focused tracks and wailing guitars, 360 Audio becomes a bit stilted in the highs and can take on some sibilance.</p><p>Jamiroquai’s “Starchild” was presents quite well. Jay Kay’s vocals are bright and crisp, and the guitar, bass guitar, and other instrumentation are reproduced just as well through the new two-way speaker system.</p><p>Bass heads won’t need to worry! Skrillex’s “Mumbai Place” has nuclear bass and sub-bass, which was well represented through the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. There is definitely some amplification of the bottom end with the Buds 3 Pro, but not at the expense of the other frequencies. I didn’t feel like the bass response bleeds into mids or overpowers vocals at any time. </p>

<p>Your mileage may vary before you play with it and find the right sound for you, but I can also say that the default tuning out of the Buds 3 Pro is a good experience as well. Minus having 360 Audio turned on — as was the case when I paired the phone to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, which doesn&apos;t support the feature — the Buds 3 Pro still present a highly satisfying listening experience. While you may not have the SSC codec on a device like the Pixel 7 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE is supported</a>. Overall, the quality is much warmer without 360 Audio, but the soundstage is still surprisingly large for Bluetooth, closed-back listening devices.</p><p>Rounding out the audio experience, you’ll get adjustable ANC and ambient sound modes and an adaptive noise-canceling mode. Airplane cabin noise of 80dB was hushed wonderfully, with only the top-end frequencies present but greatly dulled.</p><p>Ambient mode is very transparent, with no hiss, and gives one of the best balances of music to ambient noise I’ve used in a pair of earbuds in recent memory. It’s one thing to have a great hear-through mode, but another to play music with it at a level that is still enjoyable while being able to hear quality detail from the world around you. A+ for Samsung on its implementation of Ambient mode.</p>

<p>Also, the microphone quality on these is <em>really</em> good. I tested them in quiet places and in urban settings with all of the ambient traffic, cars honking, and construction noise, and while they don&apos;t kill background noise like some others, they <em>do</em> a great job of making sure your voice comes through strong over any background noise. The problem with noise cancellation on many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> is that they make you sound like you&apos;re in a tunnel, or your voice cuts out as the AI works overtime to try to cancel out background sounds. I appreciate what Samsung did here.</p><p>One last note on what I like. Living in a very beach-friendly state, I’m glad Samsung finally added dust resistance to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Buds 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> were water resistance rated only.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zdUAGfW7FqKCjqqvvGY9uU" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-closeup-S22-Ultra.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sitting on top of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zdUAGfW7FqKCjqqvvGY9uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though the touch controls are intuitive, and responsive, they still make me feel as though I’m unseating the earbuds when manipulating them. Despite the fact that often, that isn’t the case.</p><p>As for the design, getting the earbuds into their wireless charging-supported case is my only issue, as they’re a bit of a pain to place. That said, the colors on the case are a nice touch, as seeing that light blue at the bottom of the left stem can be a bit rough at times for those whose vision isn’t 20/20.</p><p>Having access to all of the features of the earbuds at your fingertips requires also having the last two generations of Galaxy S-Class devices or Flip and Fold devices. More devices <em>could be</em> added in the future, but as I always say, you need to be happy with exactly what you’re getting <em>today</em> because feature upgrades, if they do come, could be a way off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nWuY2iK4oH7zgnY4zFHhGQ" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-S22-Ultra.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWuY2iK4oH7zgnY4zFHhGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn’t necessarily something I don’t like, but it’s worth mentioning because it could be a pain. Voice Detect is an awesome feature that automatically turns on Ambient mode when the earbuds detect speaking. The problem you may encounter is that if you’re like me and start to sing whatever song is amping you up during your workout, your audio will dip.</p><p>I forget about this feature sometimes when I’m having a brisk walk and getting into my music, then I’m slightly annoyed that I have to be quiet. I’d love to see a future software update that adds a Galaxy Watch Buds Control shortcut to activate or deactivate this feature during workouts.</p>

<p>Much like AirPods, there isn’t any direct competition because of the Samsung ecosystem integration. Outside of that integration, at a similar price point, check out Jabra’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review" target="_blank">Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a>. They have similar dust and water resistance, great ANC, and are very comfortable. The JBL Live Beam 3 is another great alternative. They have around 10 hours of battery life with ANC on, as well as a very cool touch screen. </p><p>For $100 dollars less, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review">Nothing Ear (2024)</a> are worth a serious look and are the other stem-style buds that work for my ears.</p>

<p>Great sound, a robust feature set, and brilliant Samsung ecosystem connectivity make the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro the ideal pair of Bluetooth earbuds for newer Samsung Galaxy and Z-series device owners. That and the microphone call quality are why I recommend them and have called them a "must-have" for Samsung owners.</p><p>Even if stem-style earbuds don’t work for you, like me, these are worth trying. Plus, they have a great, understated look with design elements that grab you. If you live a very active lifestyle, I recommend installing a pair of Comply foam ear tips for an extra secure fit.</p>

<p>Google typically has a little fun with its major OS releases, and Android 15 is no different as we get our hands on a space theme.</p><p>For Android 15, Google&apos;s little "Bugdroid" (Android&apos;s mascot) flies through space before landing on a planet (Earth) and planting a cute yellow flag. Not only does this year&apos;s OS easter egg expand on what we&apos;ve seen with Android 14, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/android-15-landroid/">9to5Google</a> found another side to this year&apos;s quirky addition.</p><p>After viewing the easter egg for the first time, Google turns the quick video into a usable screen saver for Android devices. Enrolled testers will find the screen saver called "Landroid" with "AUTOPILOT ENGAGED" as its brief description.</p><p>All of this is said to play automatically after enabling, meaning users can watch Android&apos;s mascot soar over the stars and mark its presence with a flag. Those with a Pixel Tablet or Pixel Tablet 2 can find it by hopping into <strong>Settings > Hub Mode > Screen Saver</strong>. After selecting, Landroid will play whenever your device is "locked or docked."</p><p>Google&apos;s line of eligible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evowizz/status/1814345966096408893">Pixel phones can see this</a>, too. Those users can enter their <strong>Settings > Display & Touch > Screen Saver </strong>to find Landroid <em>after </em>viewing the easter egg. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/19/android-15s-space-themed-easter-egg-touches-down-on-terra-firma/">publication states</a> this can be done by heading into your Settings in Android 15 Beta 4.</p><p>After that, head into About Phone and tap "Android Version" three times to produce the Android 15 logo, which you should long-press until the game activates.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 is fun, but did you find the *new* Easter egg?After accessing Landroid, you'll find...

One of the biggest highlights of the update is the company&apos;s shift from PNGs to vector emojis. In short, this will enable users to enjoy and experience their emojis in a larger form factor without sacrificing quality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> were another aspect of the latest beta release.</p><p>Discoveries in the code also pointed toward more information about Pixel&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">Satellite SOS</a>." While more details about its function were found, it seems Google could charge users for those services if they want to keep it.</p><p>With Beta 4, we&apos;re moving ever closer to a full release of Android 15. As developers continue to prepare their apps for the next major shift in software, there&apos;s speculation that we could see it arrive alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Pixel 9 series in August</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google is pulling the plug for shortened links created via Google URL Shortener.</li><li>The popular goo.gl links will no longer work after August 25, 2025.</li><li>Google will also be showcasing a new interstitial page for users to notify about the new move starting this August.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced that links created via its URL Shortener will no longer be available starting next year. The company shared the announcement through a developer&apos;s blog post.</p><p>Google introduced its URL Shortener back in 2009—an easy way to shorten and share links and simultaneously measure their domain&apos;s traffic. It would make any URL shorter with the "https://goo.gl/*" form. </p><p>In 2018, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/transitioning-google-url-shortener-to-firebase-dynamic-links/">turned down</a> support for it and encouraged users to utilize new Firebase Dynamic Links (FDL), which were supposedly smarter. However, for users/ developers who created through the former URL Shortener, Google allowed the links to still redirect to the intended destination.</p>
<p>Well, that is about to change, according to Google&apos;s announcement this Thursday (July 18). While Google had already disabled the ability to create newer goog.gl links, the existing links will no longer work starting August 25, 2025. The company is further planning to display an interstitial page for users who use goog.gl links. It will notify users that those links will not be supported after the said date before navigating to the intended destination assigned to the goog.gl link.</p><p>Some users will be notified via an interstitial page starting August 23, 2024. This percentage will gradually increase until the shutdown happens next year.</p><p>"This interstitial page should help you track and adjust any affected links that you will need to transition as part of this change. We will continue to display this interstitial page until the shutdown date, after which all links served will return a 404 response," the search giant notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">blog post</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.39%;"><img id="Xk3tcK48RQxuLwiCQDjuo6" name="google-url-shortener-shutting-down.jpg" alt="Google URL Shortener shutting down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk3tcK48RQxuLwiCQDjuo6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users have to bear in mind that the interstitial page "may cause disruptions" in the current flow of goog.gl links. Google further explains, "For example, if you are using other 302 redirects, the interstitial page may prevent the redirect flow from completing correctly. If you&apos;ve embedded social metadata in your destination page, the interstitial page will likely cause these to no longer show up where the initial link is displayed. For this reason, we advise transitioning these links as soon as possible."</p><p>Users having issues with the shortened links are allowed to contact Firebase support with any questions or concerns, as the new move from the search giant may cause them inconvenience while using the existing goog.gl shortened links.</p>
