<hr>
<p>YouTube&apos;s pause button is now a portal to ads.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248391/youtube-pause-ads-widely-rolling-out">The Verge</a>, YouTube confirmed that ads for paused videos are a new reality for viewers. The platform&apos;s communications manager, Oluwa Falodun, stated: "As we’ve seen both strong advertiser and strong viewer response, we’ve since widely rolled out Pause ads to all advertisers."</p><p>Users noticed these new ads on the pause screen last week, as a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/youtube-pause-ads-rolling-out/">Tech-Issues Today</a> noted (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/11/youtube-pause-ad-tv-update/">9to5Google</a>). Several threads appeared on YouTube&apos;s subreddit with users showcasing ads after they paused their videos. The ad appeared on the right half of their display and seemingly shrunk paused videos to the left.</p><p>The issue even appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1fhqzaa/why_does_an_ad_pop_up_every_time_i_pause/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe">on a mobile device</a> as the advertisement rose from the bottom of their display.</p><p>The publication adds that this was a long time coming as YouTube kicked off a limited test of this new ad variant last year. During Alphabet&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 2024 earnings call</a>, Google&apos;s Philipp Schindler told The Verge: "Advertisers unsurprisingly love them!" Moreover, the idea of ads on paused videos is "commanding premium pricing from advertisers."</p><p>Regarding the current situation, YouTube says ads for paused videos were designed to be "less disruptive."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seriously @YouTube? You're putting up ads when you pause a video now?I am about to install a computer in place of the fire stick so I can have an ad blocker... Your ads are getting ridiculous. pic.twitter.com/OT4JMduGTU<a href="https://twitter.com/Roaether/status/1832186161743216724">September 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We&apos;ve heard the idea of "less disruptive" ads on YouTube before, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tests-less-disruptive-mid-roll-ads">that involved mid-roll ads</a>, not adding ones when paused.</p><p>In August, the platform was spotted experimenting with picture-in-picture (PIP) mid-roll ads. The test explained that the ads would shrink a viewer&apos;s video to advertise it. Users wouldn&apos;t miss out on their viewing experience, and YouTube would still get the point across.</p><p>It&apos;s similar to a football broadcast not taking you away from the game during a thirty-second timeout. However, what we&apos;re seeing now, at least for smart TVs, are the echoes of that PIP experiment from August.</p><p>Let&apos;s also not forget YouTube&apos;s current war against ad blockers, which might force it to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">server-side ads into videos</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Lately, most of the things I write about Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">seem negative</a>. That happens when the company continues to do things people disapprove of, but it&apos;s still a bit of a drag. I imagine it&apos;s just as much of a drag to read bad press about Google all of the time if you&apos;re entrenched in its ecosystem of devices or software.</p><p>Today is different. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/google-arts-culture-colombia-amazon/">blog post from Google</a> reminded me about one of the reasons I use Google products and how much I enjoy some of them. Case in point: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-arts-and-culture-redesign">Google Arts & Culture app</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;m not a particularly fancy or artsy guy, at least not as much as I wish I were. But I do enjoy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-stolen-art-gallery-review">seeing and learning about beautiful things</a>, both natural and from the minds and hands of mankind. That&apos;s why I installed the app in the first place; it gives us a glimpse of things we might not ever be able to see otherwise.</p><p>The app itself also has other features that let you build a gallery or morph your selfies. You can even find art that looks like you or your dog. I mostly use it to explore the world around me, though. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural">If you&apos;ve never looked at it, you should</a>.</p>

<p>As I was cruising through my reading list, I came across Google telling and showing me work in Columbia studying ancient art. Found along the edge of the Amazon, this prehistoric art tells a story about the culture and myths of the Jiw people, an ethnic group that still lives in the La Lindosa region today.</p><p>People at the University of Exeter at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/la-lindosa">working to study and preserve</a> this ancient art and that&apos;s fabulous. They know about things like this. I only learned of it today, because Google showcased it for me. I mentioned I&apos;m not particularly artsy and I&apos;m not much of an archeologist, either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="z5aof5RM28pAmeZubAYW8H" name="Google-arts-and-culture-croatia.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Google Arts & Culture app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5aof5RM28pAmeZubAYW8H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="360" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am curious about a lot of different things, and Google has often shown me something marvelous through the Arts & Culture app—things I probably would never have heard of otherwise. I can&apos;t help but think that&apos;s fabulous.</p>
<p>When we think of Google, we probably think about things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">smartphones</a>, software platforms, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">AI</a>, and other tech-centric ideas. That&apos;s what Google is known for because that&apos;s the bulk of what it does. </p><p>Google also does plenty of things I think it shouldn&apos;t, and I&apos;m not alone in that way of thinking. I enjoy having an opportunity and a platform to call Google out for everything I think is terrible. I also enjoy being able to appreciate something the company does that provides a few minutes of joy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other things Google does that people approve of, too. The company provides the essential service of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/">auditing internet software</a> for exploits that could compromise our online safety. It spends money, time, and resources on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.google/research-areas/health-bioscience/">medical research</a> into things like cancer and disease diagnosis and epidemiological studies. These sorts of things are more important than an app that lets me see and learn about the beautiful things I&apos;ll never get to see, even if they don&apos;t feel as personal.</p><p>I tend to forget about the good a tech company can do when all I see is anticompetitive behavior, broken promises, and huge defense contracts. The good things are still there, though. All we need to do is look for them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-prime-big-deal-days-2">What is Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>Set to kick off on October 8th and run for 48 hours, Amazon&apos;s Big Deal Days is basically an autumnal Prime Day, featuring hundreds of exclusive deals for anyone who has a Prime membership. </p><p>Everything from smartphones and laptops to clothing and kitchen appliances is expected to go on sale, so now would be a good time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Prime</strong></a> if you haven&apos;t yet. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-next-prime-day-2">When is the next Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Although it&apos;s not <em>technically </em>Prime Day, Amazon&apos;s 48-hour Big Deal Days sale is essentially the same thing and it&apos;s set to kick off on October 8th. </p><p>If you&apos;re looking for the next <em>official </em>Prime Day, you can probably expect that sale to go live sometime in mid-July 2025. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-member-to-get-the-deals-2">Do I have to be a member to get the deals?</h2>
<p>Yep. Just like Amazon&apos;s regular Prime Day sale event in July, the vast majority of deals during Big Deal Days will only be available to Prime members. Fortunately, if you don&apos;t want to pay, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and enjoy access to all of the best deals without paying a dime. </p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an update to passkeys that lets users save and sync those important credentials across devices.</li><li>This will remove the need to scan a QR code when attempting to sign in outside of Android; however, a new PIN has been added for E2EE protection.</li><li>Users can save and sync their passkeys on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, while ChromeOS support is in beta testing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest update to passkeys brings some much-needed convenience to an important safety measure.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-password-manager-passkeys-update-september-2024/">Keyword post</a>, users can save passkeys in Google&apos;s Password Manager across Windows, MacOS, and Linux devices through the Chrome browser. It&apos;ll also come to Chromebooks, as the feature is currently in beta for ChromeOS.</p><p>Saving passkeys brings some refreshing convenience. When signing in, users only need to provide their "Touch ID" (fingerprint) before gaining access. Before, they couldn&apos;t save <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-next-major-phase-of-passkey">passkeys</a> on other devices outside of Android, so they&apos;d have to scan a QR code using their phone.</p><p>This update should make things faster and more secure as Google detailed another update.</p><p>The company is rolling out a new security measure with this update dubbed "Password Manager PIN." Before users can access their passkeys on new devices, they must use their PIN to authenticate their identity. The PIN is end-to-end encrypted, so only you have access to it.</p>

<p>Devices you&apos;ve signed into will ask for this new PIN whenever you attempt to view your saved passkeys or create new ones. Additionally, Google states users can tap the "PIN options" menu when creating a PIN to create a longer "alpha-numeric" code.</p><p>Alternatively, users can use their Android device&apos;s screen lock credentials in mind.</p><p>The ability to sync your passkeys across devices is rolling out today (Sept 19), though iOS support is "coming soon" and ChromeOS is still in beta.</p><p>Passkeys have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/upgrade-to-passkeys-on-pixel-with-google-password-manager">gained interest from users</a> looking to protect their digital lives. Google has continued to do its part as it rolled out an update for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-passkey-high-risk-user-update">high-risk</a>" users in July. The update is a byproduct of its partnership with Internews and is offered through its Advanced Protection Program (APP).</p><p>"High-risk" users are those like journalists and human rights workers. Their sensitive data is what Google hopes to address better through the APP as those users could enroll with a digital passkey or a physical security key. The company encouraged those signing up to add an alternate recovery method in case something goes awry.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Vivo's next V40e mid-range phone is coming soon, likely at the end of this month.</li><li>The device is expected to ship with Dimensity 7300 and Android 14 out of the box.</li><li>Vivo confirms the device's battery and cameras, amongst other notable specs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After the recent launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-vivo-v40-series-now-flaunts-the-zeiss-camera-branding-on-both-models">Vivo V40 series</a>, the company seems to be gearing up for yet another mid-range phone launch under the same series, starting with the Indian market. </p><p>The phone is dubbed Vivo V40e, and the new website listing hints that it is coming soon. Meanwhile, some of the upcoming phone&apos;s specs have already been confirmed; another leak indicates the full specs of the V40e.</p>
<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vivo.com/in/activity/v40e-launch">per the listing</a>, the device has an updated design over the predecessor Vivo V30e, with a new camera visor at the back and color variants in Mint Green and Royal Bronze. Further, it should feel light in hand, weighing around 183 grams.</p><p>The device will feature a 6.77-inch screen (which appears curved on the edges) with 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rates. Keeping the lights on is a 5500mAh battery capacity that further comes with 80W fast charging support.</p>

<p>For optics, the revamped camera visor features ZEISS-powered dual cameras: a 50MP primary camera and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera. There&apos;s also a 50MP sensor on the front for selfies. </p><p>Per the listing, the company is firmly emphasizing its portrait camera capabilities, as the device is believed to capture 2x professional portrait mode. Additionally, the main camera supports 4K video capture with OIS+EIS.</p>

<p>While the company has confirmed these specs, tipster Yogesh Brar on X noted some other notable parameters, including a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 SoC, a shift from Qualcomm wherein the V30e came with Snapdragon 6 Gen 1. Besides, we can expect 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of RAM. The device is further expected to ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based FunTouch OS.</p><p>Lastly, it is aimed at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range segment</a> priced around Rs 20,000 to 30,000, roughly between $240 and $360. Per the tipster, the launch should be around the last week of this month, similar to last year&apos;s model.</p>

<hr>
<p>A court in Texas ruled that Samsung&apos;s devices have used wireless charging tech based on infringed patents and ordered the company to pay a fine of over $192 million.</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled against Samsung, stating it violated five of Mojo Mobility&apos;s wireless charging patents, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/samsung-hit-with-192-mln-us-patent-verdict-over-wireless-chargers-2024-09-16/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports.</p><p>Mojo Mobility sued Samsung in 2022, claiming the tech giant used its patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">wireless charging tech</a> without permission.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Afshin Partovi, the inventor of the wireless charging tech, and other key Mojo Mobility members made several trips to Samsung’s headquarters in South Korea in 2013 to discuss a possible licensing deal for their technology.</p><p>However, the negotiation fell through, and Samsung went ahead and used Mojo Mobility&apos;s patented tech in its wireless charging systems, rolling it out across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a>, smartwatches, and earbuds—all without a proper license.</p><p>Because Samsung’s infringement was found to be intentional, the judge could potentially triple the damages. Despite this, Samsung claims the patents are invalid and even sued Mojo Mobility in 2023 to overturn them, but that attempt failed.</p><p>In the initial trial held in January, the jury ruled that Samsung had to pay $67.5 million in damages, plus a recurring royalty of $1.50 for each Galaxy phone that infringes Mojo Mobility’s patents.</p><p>However, the judge found the initial trial&apos;s outcome unreliable because the jury seemed confused about "running royalties" versus "lump-sum royalties," as reported by The Global Legal Post, leading to a new trial being ordered.</p><p>If Samsung doesn&apos;t pay the fine from the legal battle, many of its devices could lose wireless charging capability.</p><p>It&apos;s perhaps worth noting that Samsung was hit with a $142 million <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/gkpldydydpb/SAMSUNG%20PATENT%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf" target="_blank">judgment</a> in a separate 5G patent infringement case in the same East Texas court back in April.</p>

<ul><li>The recent Android 15 QPR beta holds clues about an upcoming "sync notification" feature for devices.</li><li>The beta didn't go into detail; however, the feature could help users keep tabs on important alerts no matter the device in use.</li><li>Google has other updates coming for notifications like a new "compact" option and a "cooldown" option for repetitive buzzes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A future Android feature drop may hold the arrival of a notification feature we&apos;ve long hoped for.</p><p>While looking through the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR beta</a>, Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sync-notifications-android-devices-leak-3481920/">Android Authority</a>) discovered a "sync across devices" function. It&apos;s unclear whether Google will roll this out to <em>all </em>Android devices—although there&apos;s hope. Regardless, Rahman suspects this "sync" will arrive for notifications due to the code spotted within the Settings menu.</p><p>The post notes a "com.android.settings.notification.syncacrossdevices" string in the QPR1 Beta 2&apos;s Settings.</p><p>Whenever this rolls out, it seems Google will offer the "sync" button alongside the sensitive notification option and a new "cooldown" button. Additionally, Rahman claims that the code&apos;s exclusion of "com.google.android" suggests this sync feature could arrive for all Android devices.</p><p>This way, if you cancel an unimportant notification on your Android phone, you won&apos;t have to do so again on your Android tablet or other devices; since they&apos;re synced, it&apos;ll be dismissed everywhere.</p><p>Google is likely still in development for the feature considering the beta didn&apos;t offer much insight into its functionality. Moreover, whenever this arrives, users can keep tabs on their important notifications no matter which device they&apos;re using.</p>

<p>It seems Google has a lot in store for notifications with Android 15 as that "cooldown" feature was first spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-notification-cooldown">Developer Preview 1</a>. The feature will seemingly reduce the frequency and repetitiveness of certain notifications on our devices. The early discovery showed that Google could give users agency over how the feature works, like whether it&apos;ll limit conversations or all notifications.</p><p>The audio cue of these notifications on cooldown will drop, though it doesn&apos;t seem like they&apos;ll go completely silent.</p><p>Toward the end of Android 15&apos;s beta, the development of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-compact-notification-layout-discovered">less disruptive, more compact</a> variant was spotted. If the "compact" version is desired, notifications will appear as a single line of text with a quick "reply" button, and the app&apos;s logo. Users can tap the dropdown menu to see the message in full.</p><p>While the customization option seemed relatively put together, speculation suggests it might not arrive for Android 15&apos;s stable launch. If not, perhaps we have the December feature drop to look forward to.</p><p>The notification sync feature was spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a>, which rolled out to enrolled testers last week. It was a hefty patch, packed with loads of Pixel Bluetooth and system fixes. More importantly, it held some insight into a few upcoming features like a redesign for the Quick Settings menu.</p><p>Android 15 is rumored to arrive for devices in October.</p>

Once again, Mint Mobile has you covered with a truly outstanding offer — <em>if</em> you&apos;re looking for a new wireless carrier.</p><p>It works like this. Order the new Google Pixel 9 alongside any six-month data plan at Mint and the T-Mobile-owned carrier will hook you up with with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$400 discount AND six additional months of wireless</strong></a> coverage for free. That&apos;s like getting 50% off both a new phone and an entire year of wireless coverage. I&apos;d like to see Amazon&apos;s big sale top that (spoiler alert: it won&apos;t). </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was just released on August 22nd, but you can already score a whopping $400 discount AND six months of free wireless coverage when you bundle the purchase of the phone with any six-month data plan at Mint. It's easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">best Google Pixel 9 deals</a> I've seen since the phone was first unveiled earlier this month, but don't expect it to be around for long. </p>
<p>Need more size? It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/6810506/"><strong>Mint has dropped an identical offer on the larger Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</strong></a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1e720f4-a69c-4b11-a3c4-1d3c933b3e09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Thanks to this deal, you can get Google&apos;s latest flagship phone alongside an <em>entire year</em> of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $489 when you pay upfront (or $21 per month if you use affirm). Even if you sign up for Mint&apos;s most-expensive Unlimited plan, you&apos;re still looking at a max upfront payment of $579. That&apos;s over $200 less than you&apos;d pay if you bought the unlocked Pixel 9 by itself, and that&apos;s not even considering the value of covering your phone bill for a year. </p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carrier</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile isn&apos;t a slouch when it comes to coverage either. Owned and operated by T-Mobile (and famously endorsed by Ryan Reynolds), Mint operates with a simple buy-in-bulk plan system that gives you access to the world&apos;s largest 5G network, plus a free mobile hotspot and calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, on the other hand, comes packed with Google&apos;s latest AI-powered technology, excellent cameras, and the efficiency of the Tensor G4 chipset. You also get seven years of OS updates guaranteed, which means you could be using this phone long after you say goodbye to Mint (if you decide to do so).</p>

<p><em>Now that you&apos;ve saved some serious cash on a great new device, take a few of those dollars and invest in one of the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases"><em>best Google Pixel 9 cases</em></a><em>. </em></p>

For now, these are devices with a low adoption rate and high price tags. They&apos;re not something most people are looking to buy.</p><p>One day that&apos;s going to change. Maybe not soon, but eventually, it will become normal to have a phone that flips open or rolls out. When that happens, one of two things also needs to happen: either someone has to invent a phone display that doesn&apos;t tear, or the warranty has to get a lot better.</p>
<p>The screen on your phone is like a sandwich. Layers of glass and circuitry are used to build a screen that can show you what you want to see and know when and where you touched it. The concept of how they work isn&apos;t difficult to understand even if building one correctly is.</p><p>When you add movement into the mix a lot has to adapt. Some layers in a display were already flexible, others only needed a small material change, while others like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-video-shows-ultra-thin-glass-tested">the glass</a> needed something brand new. We got there and there are plenty of phones that can fold or flip.</p>
<p>What many people don&apos;t think about is how this affects the individual layers of the screen. We&apos;ve all seen a broken phone screen, and often, under the busted glass, there may be a big dark splotch that resembles spilled ink or weird technicolor lines on the parts of the display that still work. These are the other components in the display sandwich that broke or were torn after the physical damage to the glass happened. These layers are so fragile that glass is used to protect them.</p><p>This is compounded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-display-damage-reports">with foldable phones</a>. There are a lot of people who have seen a photo of a foldable screen that&apos;s blacked out or looks torn, especially around the crease itself. You don&apos;t have to break the glass for this to happen because you&apos;re flexing all the layers of the sandwich, hoping that nothing fails.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">If it happened to you</a>, it&apos;s even worse because getting a company to stand behind <em>everything</em> also means a timely repair and that doesn&apos;t always happen. It happens more to phones with screens that move so companies making them need to offer better support options.</p><p>I&apos;m lucky. In all the years I&apos;ve done this for a living and all the devices that have moved across my desk, I&apos;ve only had to file a warranty claim twice. Both times, everything went off without a hitch. If you&apos;re curious, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tabpro-and-notepro-review">Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2</a> had a screen defect, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review-iphone-users-perspective">Pixel 4</a> had a bulging battery. Both Samsung and Google promptly sent out a replacement and asked me to return the defective product.</p>
<p>This is because both products had problems that shouldn&apos;t have happened. Using that logic means a phone with a screen that can bend shouldn&apos;t have a defect or break unless you did something to cause it. The way things work now is that the warranty is decided by time, not usage.</p><p>If you baby your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/atandt-says-its-skipping-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and are always extra careful to never fold it while something could enter the hinge, you&apos;re only covered for a certain amount of time. If it breaks before the date Google stops covering it, you file a warranty claim. If it breaks the day after, you pay a hefty repair bill or buy a new phone.</p>
<p>That&apos;s how things work now and I get it — Snap On can offer a lifetime warranty on a wrench but Google or any other phone maker can&apos;t do the same for a phone that wasn&apos;t designed to last forever. But the warranty period on a phone screen that&apos;s more likely to break and one that&apos;s not can&apos;t be the same. It&apos;s simply not fair to us.</p><p>The way foldable phones are built gets better each generation, and maybe this won&apos;t be something we need to worry about soon. Some manufacturers also have a special warranty for foldable phones, and that shows you realize the need to differentiate. I know that when the majority of phones have flexible screens, we&apos;re going to see a lot more of them breaking. I hope this doesn&apos;t mean we see a lot more people out of luck because of it.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one of the better foldable phones you can buy. Samsung has improved the design and durability, making it water and even dust resistant so you can worry less about your phone and more about life.</p></p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> has been one of the better alternatives to ChatGPT and other similar AI assistants. However, Android users will have an extra edge with Gemini since they already use most other Google services. Gemini is now integrating some of them on the web.</p><p>The search giant is now adding Google Keep and Google Tasks extensions to Gemini on the web client, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/17/google-tasks-keep-gemini-extensions/">9to5Google</a>. Users can easily access the extensions by typing <strong>@Google Keep</strong> or <strong>@Google Tasks</strong> on the search bar. They can create notes and lists, add items to current lists, or find stuff from them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.72%;"><img id="H2Ldpg6B3B28JfhuLv2f3L" name="google-keep-extension-on-gemini.jpg" alt="Google Keep and Tasks extensions on Gemini web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2Ldpg6B3B28JfhuLv2f3L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="927" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, they can ask Gemini to perform their tasks using stored notes in the Google Keep app. Some of the examples shared by the search giant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15230597?sjid=3085362898266051411-AP">Gemini Apps Help page</a> include:</p>
<ul><li>Create a note called [note name]</li><li>Create a list called [list name] with [item 1, item 2, …]</li></ul>
<p>Similarly, for Google Tasks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15230285?sjid=3085362898266051411-AP">support page</a> shared a few prompts that users can get along with:</p>
<ul><li>Remind me on [date] at [time] to [task].</li><li>Remind me at [time] to call [name].</li><li>Add [task] in my to-dos.</li></ul>
<p>Users can review what these new extensions can do on the support pages. There are some actions that these extensions cannot perform. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Modify a note</li><li>Delete notes and lists</li><li>Share notes and lists</li><li>View images and drawings</li><li>Add an image</li></ul>
<p>These are additions to the other Google Workspace extensions, which include Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, and Google Drive. Summarizing emails is one of the most used activities in Gemini support. It appears these new extensions&apos; support should make organizing and keeping notes a lot easier for Android phone users.</p><p>In other news, Gemini Live, the AI tool for natural conversations, has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">made free to all users</a>, a privilege previously reserved for Gemini Advanced subscribers.</p>
