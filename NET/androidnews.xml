You&apos;ll have to buy a year of Mint&apos;s unlimited tier to receive the savings, but the carrier is sweetening the deal by carving 50% off that plan, as well.</p><p>In other words, not only are you getting a record-smashing discount on one of the year&apos;s best phones, but you&apos;ll be getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> we&apos;ve ever used for only $15 per month ($180 upfront). Even Black Friday couldn&apos;t touch those savings.Â </p>

<p>Order the Google Pixel 9 Pro during Mint Mobile's holiday sale and you'll score an incredible 40% off the device when you pair your purchase with one year of any data plan. As if that wasn't enough, Mint is also dropping 50% off the Unlimited plan, which means you could be getting one of 2024's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> AND a full 12 months of T-Mobile-powered wireless for as little as $779 (or $33 per month using affirm). That's cheaper than the phone was <em>by itself</em> during Black Friday!Â </p>
<p>ðŸ‘€<strong>Alternative holiday deal: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>Get $500 off the Google Pixel 9, plus 50% off a year of Unlimited at Mint</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro/6810410/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="40c4ebdc-ec19-4147-b3db-938bee54a5d1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB: $999" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB: $999">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This offer is quite similar to a recent Mint Mobile deal that gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$500 off the base model Pixel 9</strong></a> when you buy the phone alongside some wireless, but if you need more power in your devices, this Google Pixel 9 Pro deal is tough to beat.Â </p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro triumphs by packing premium specs and AI-powered technology into a compact, easy-to-hold frame. Both the Pro and its XL big sibling come with seven years of guaranteed OS and security updates, plus you get unrivalled camera tech, the lightning-fast Tensor G4 chipset, and some truly remarkable battery life straight out of the box.</p><p>At full price, the Google Pixel 9 Pro may be a tough sell, but this Mint Mobile is changing everything. Let me put it this way: during Black Friday/Cyber Monday, the price of the unlocked Pixel 9 Pro dropped to $799, which was a record low at the time. By comparison, you can head to Mint Mobile right now and get the phone for a full $20 less, AND your phone bill will be covered for a year by one of the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a>. If you&apos;re in the market for a new wireless plan, yeah, it&apos;s that good.Â </p>

<p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday were exceedingly long this year. In fact, some Cyber Monday deals are <em>still</em> around! If you took advantage of the sales and got yourself an e-reader, that's awesome. You might just kickstart a reading habit right in time for 2025.</p><p>Choosing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">right e-ink tablet</a> is no easy task. There are so many cool options to pick from, even if they're not as versatile as full-blown Android tablets from the likes of Samsung, Google, and OnePlus. If you just bought an e-reader, here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your new device.</p><p>I've been mad about e-readers and anything E Ink since the days of the Sony Reader, c. 2006. Allow an avid bookwork such as myself to help you get the best possible reading experience from your fancy new reading tab.</p>

<h2 id="adjust-your-settings-2">Adjust your settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2mBQWAp4hXku3mq32vqFR" name="Onyx Boox Page e-ink tablet and Kindle Oasis e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Page e-ink tablet and Kindle Oasis e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2mBQWAp4hXku3mq32vqFR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether it's an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> or an Onyx Boox, your new e-reader has various brightness, contrast, and light settings. Modern E Ink tablets all let you adjust the backlight and front light as well. This is the first thing to tweak right after setting up your new e-reader. Find the right balance of brightness and saturation to give you maximum eye comfort while reading.</p><p>I like to turn the brightness and warmth levels down to give my e-reader the most paper-like feel possible. This looks especially nice on color e-readers such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c-review">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</a> or the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C. Since these tabs have anti-glare displays, the papery look is absolutely fantastic with dimmer backlighting.</p><p>Of course, this is a subjective setting. My friend and colleague Nick Sutrich, for example, likes his settings to be on the warmer side as it's easier on his eyes.</p><p>After the display satisfies your eyeballs, customize any physical page-turning buttons that your e-reader may or may not have. You can also customize the gestures on your tablet for more efficient readability and usability.</p><p>For example, the latest Onyx Boox tablets have vertical swipe gestures along either side of the screen that can be personalized. I like mine to be set to brightness and volume adjustability. Swiping up along the right corner increases brightness, whereas swiping downwards along the edge of the display decreases it. It's the same thing for the volume settings but on the left side of the display. You get the gist.</p>
<h2 id="try-different-reading-apps-2">Try different reading apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FGKYDpSBxanfAX97evwdN" name="Onyx Boox Page e-ink tablet and Kindle Oasis e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Page e-ink tablet and Kindle Oasis e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGKYDpSBxanfAX97evwdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're on an Android e-reader like a Boox or a Bigme, you're going to be very happy. One of the biggest reasons why I love Android e-readers like these is because I can download and use any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ebook-apps-android">my favorite reading apps</a> or just any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">best Android apps</a>, period. Amazon limits you from doing so, which I find stifling.</p><p>Open the Google Play Store on your Android E Ink tablet and go crazy kid. From the Kindle store and Manga Plus to Crunchyroll and Wattpad, you can go all out. It's one of the most exciting parts of setting up your new e-reader. Google Play Books is pretty great, too, and if you're in the North American region, you'll find great sales on the platform. You should also get local library apps, such as Libby, so you can borrow e-books from digital libraries in your neighborhood.</p><p>I like to install the Google Drive app as well so I can access my personal library of e-books, which I've been collecting and adding to for a decade now. If you're accessing a local library from your laptop or PC, I highly recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> for computers. Not only does it help you convert e-book formats and add your preferred covers to them, but you can directly connect your e-reader to your computer and sort, arrange, import, export, convert, and edit e-books via Calibre. It's the ultimate e-book management tool, and it's free to use!</p><p>And don't forget to adjust screen settings per app once you're done decking out your e-reader. Some content, such as graphic novels and manga, require different profiles and contrast settings compared to apps like e-book readers or web browsers.</p>
<h2 id="goodreads-is-invaluable-2">Goodreads is invaluable</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WLEBSqiWByjtuMYoXoAe4g" name="onyx-boox-note-air-4-c-goodreads-lifestyle" alt="Goodreads app on the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WLEBSqiWByjtuMYoXoAe4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi  / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After you're all set with the right apps and tools, it's time to start reading! But don't forget, you can track your reading with the fabulous Goodreads app. Disagree with me all you want, but you probably didn't read 300 books in one summer, so I'm vetoing everyone. Goodreads is the perfect platform to track your reading progress, set reading goals, find new reads, and just talk about books in general.</p><p>My e-reader setup is incomplete without Goodreads on it. I don't know how I would keep up with my yearly reading goals without the platform. You can set a yearly reading challenge for yourself, and it is completely customizable. It's highly motivating to see how much you've read at any given point in the year.</p><p>The Goodreads community is warm, welcoming, and extremely passionate. There are community events where users can vote on the best books of the year in each category or create their own lists. You can even become a Goodreads librarian if you want. Be sure to check it out to help you find all the latest and greatest new releases in whatever genre of books you prefer.</p>
<hr>
<p>There's no limit or end to what you can do to make your e-reading experience better. These were my top tips and tricks based on countless e-readers and E Ink tablets that I have used and tested.</p><p>Keep playing around with your new e-reader and have fun with it; that's the most important thing. I hope you enjoy your reading sessions and find the perfect read for any mood. Now curl up in a cozy nook with a warm cuppa coffee, preferably a furry four-legged companion, and a soft blanket. Happy reading!</p>

<p>OPPO's Find X series has been a top alternative to Samsung's Galaxy brand for a while, especially in Europe and Asia. The company's newest base-model flagship, the OPPO Find X8, is its best yet, shipping with ColorOS 15 and plenty of OPPO AI features. So, how does it compare with Samsung's current Galaxy S24?</p><p>The bottom line is that there are more differences than similarities between these two phones. The Find X8 has a MediaTek processor, while the Galaxy S24 has a Qualcomm processor. The Galaxy S24 is widely available in the US and supports North American cellular bands, while the Find X8 does not, and so on. If you're lucky enough to be in a region where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oppo-find-x8-series-is-taking-the-fight-to-the-iphone-16-globally">OPPO Find X8</a> is readily available for purchase, it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">better phone overall</a> than the Galaxy S24 â€” but remember, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> is right around the corner.</p><p>In this comparison, we'll break down the differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> and the Find X8, helping you figure out which is right for you.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-design-2">OPPO Find X8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JRjcJ3VFsrBiMwS7Y859hT" name="OPPO-Find-X8" alt="OPPO Find X8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JRjcJ3VFsrBiMwS7Y859hT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OPPO Find X8 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 are not massive flagship phones like the Find X8 Pro or the Galaxy S24 Ultra. However, the Find X8 and its 6.59-inch screen are decisively larger than the 6.2-inch Galaxy S24. Measuring 157.4 x 74.3 x 7.9 mm, the Find X8 won't feel absurdly large in the hand. It's significantly heavier than the Galaxy S24, which only weighs 168.1 grams and measures just 147.1 x 70.61 x 7.62 mm. By comparison, the 193-gram weight of the Find X8 is significant.</p><p>Otherwise, both phones have flat screens and rectangular chassis with curved corners. The OPPO Find X8 is available in Star Grey, Space Black, Shell Pink, and Blue, while the Galaxy S24 can be had in Onyx Black, Marble Grey, Cobalt Violet, or Amber Yellow.</p><p>In terms of durability, the Galaxy S24 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP68 water and dust-resistant</a>, which means it can handle submersion in shallow water for brief periods. The OPPO Find X8 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">meets the higher IP69 standard</a>, testing against high-temperature and high-pressure water jets. In other words, you probably won't notice the difference between these phones where durability is concerned.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9h4qLmMGqc4uXuxtpH2esm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-purple-frame-01.jpg" alt="Looking at the different colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9h4qLmMGqc4uXuxtpH2esm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the OPPO Find X8 is more understated than prior Find models, specifically on the back. The circular camera housing OnePlus and OPPO are known for is still here, but the two-toned materials and colorways are largely gone. This could make the Find X8 more approachable to people considering an OPPO phone for the first time, since the Find X8 is more widely available globally than its predecessor.</p><p>Still, Samsung's method of individual, vertically arranged camera lenses is more subtle than that of the Find X8.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-hardware-and-specs-2">OPPO Find X8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>More so than the exterior, the big differences between the Find X8 and the Galaxy S24 are on the inside. Notably, the OPPO Find X8 uses the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 processor, paired with either 12GB or 16GB of memory. Samsung has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> inside the Galaxy S24, which I'd suspect many would view as superior to the MediaTek chip. However, it's worth noting that the MediaTek 9400 in the Find X8 actually beats the Snapdragon SoC in the Galaxy S24 in Geekbench 6 benchmarks.</p><p>For those considering the OPPO Find X8 in Europe, you should know that the Galaxy S24 models in your region will have an Exynos 2300 chip, not a Snapdragon processor. As such, the performance advantage of the Find X8 could be even greater.</p><p>The two phones have similar display specifications, both featuring AMOLED panels that can reach 120Hz. Of course, the Find X8's display is slightly larger than the Galaxy S24's screen. Crucially, the Find X8 is significantly brighter than the Galaxy S24. OPPO claims a 4,500-nit peak brightness rating on the Find X8, while Samsung claims a 2,600-nit peak brightness rating on the Galaxy S24. This will be most noticeable outdoors, where OPPO and OnePlus displays are often easier to see in direct sunlight than Samsung panels.</p>

<p>In terms of battery life and charging, OPPO crushes Samsung. The Find X8 ships with a 5,630mAh battery that should last longer than the 4,000mAh battery in the Galaxy S24. More importantly, the Galaxy S24 charges extremely slow. It can only do up to 25W wired charging, whereas the Find X8 supports up to 80W wired charging. The disparity is greater when wireless charging is considered: the Find X8 supports 50W, while the Galaxy S24 supports 15W.</p><p>With Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 available on the Find X8, the comparison is clear. Oppo is offering better hardware on the Find X8 than Samsung will give you on the Galaxy S24.</p>

<p>Camera hardware has long been a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-leak-claims-oppos-find-x8-ultra-will-be-a-camera-beast">key reason to buy an OPPO phone</a>, and that hasn't changed. The rear camera sensors on the back of the Find X8 are better than those on the Galaxy S24, which Samsung hasn't changed in years. Both phones offer 3x optical zoom with telephoto lenses, which are essential going into 2025, but the quality figures to be better from the Find X8.</p><p>All three rear lenses on the Find X8 are 50MP, including the main wide lens, ultrawide lens, and telephoto lens. The main sensor is a 50MP, f/1.8 lens with a 1/1.56-inch sensor size with optical image stabilization. On top of that, you also get the 50MP, f/2.0 ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. Rounding out the offerings is a 50MP, f/2.6 telephoto lens capable of 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Compare that to the Galaxy S24's 50MP, f/1.8 main sensor, 10MP, f/2.4 telephoto lens, and 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide lens, and it hardly feels like a fair fight. If camera quality is one of your biggest needs, choose the OPPO Find X8.</p>

<p>If both the OPPO Find X8 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 are available in your region, it's a no-brainer. The Find X8 offers better specs, from a faster processor to a more capable camera system, at around the same price. The Galaxy S24 might feel more familiar to One UI users and definitely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">packs more AI features</a>. However, if you're inclined to stick with Samsung, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-s25-plus-colors-seemingly-confirmed-as-sim-card-trays-leak">wait for the Galaxy S25</a> in hopes that it can better compete with the OPPO Find X8.</p>

<p>The fall season was packed with a ton of exciting releases, highlighted by the Google Pixel 9 series. However, we're already amidst the winter season, and that means new Samsung and OnePlus flagships are nearing release. The Samsung Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13 figure to be two of the best Android phones in 2025, so how do they compare?</p><p>That's a complicated question. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is already available in China, we don't know everything about either upcoming flagship. For the OnePlus 13, we know the phone's exact specifications, but lack US pricing information. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25's</a> specs are mostly known due to reliable rumors and leaks, but there are a few holes. With that being said, we have a pretty good idea of how these two phones stack up against one another, and there's one that appears to have an early edge.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 lineup is set to include at least three variants: the standard Galaxy S25, the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus, and the flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra. On the other hand, the OnePlus 13 is the brand's only flagship model for 2025. It's important to remember that the OnePlus 13's 6.82-inch screen size and large form factor will feel more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s23-ultra">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in hand. However, OnePlus' flagships are usually priced like Samsung's base-model phones, which is why you may be choosing between a OnePlus 13 and Galaxy S25 next month.</p><p>Still, the size difference may be the biggest reason to choose one of these phones over the other. It's jarring. The Samsung Galaxy S25 is expected to roughly measure 146.9 x 70.4 x 7.2mm, according to the latest leaks and rumors. That's relatively miniature compared to the OnePlus 13, which measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5-8.9 mm. If you like small phones, the choice is easy: go with the Galaxy S25. Want a phone that feels more like the Galaxy S25 Ultra on a budget? The OnePlus 13 is your pick.</p><p>There are a few other design and build differences worth noting. The OnePlus 13 has a circular camera housing that holds its triple-camera system and flash. It's physically loud, off-center, and large. By comparison, the Galaxy S25's camera lenses are separated and much more understated than the OnePlus 13's camera array.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZqNPMAWgWh5mcrJEhfyyXh" name="OnePlus-13-launch-teaser-02.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 launch tease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZqNPMAWgWh5mcrJEhfyyXh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones will have excellent durability ratings; the Galaxy S25 is expected to have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP68</a> rating for dust and water-resistance, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-13-waterproof">the OnePlus 13 will be IP69-rated</a>. The newer IP69 rating tests the OnePlus 13 against high-pressure and high-temperature water jets, and likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">won't make a major impact during daily use</a>. The Galaxy S25 is also expected to have Gorilla Glass coverings for the front and rear glass, and the OnePlus 13 has a Crystal Shield glass front.</p><p>The two phones will have different fit and finish options, too. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">The Galaxy S25 is rumored to come in at least four colors</a>: Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green. They'll be available on a glass back, whereas the OnePlus 13 can be configured with an eco-leather or glass back in either black, blue, or white colorways.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>According to the latest leaks, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">Samsung Galaxy S25 will exclusively be powered by Qualcomm chips this year</a>, in all regions. It's technically still possible that the phone could use the Exynos 2500 platform in some places, but it's unlikely at this point. This means that both the Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13 will be powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, which includes the company's custom Oryon cores for greater performance and efficiency.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13 both use the same display technology (AMOLED, 120Hz), their screen sizes will be a key differentiator. The Galaxy S25 is expected to boast a larger screen than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, at 6.3 inches, but that's still smaller than the 6.82-inch OnePlus 13. While the exact specs are unknown, the OnePlus 13's 4,500-nit peak brightness rating should be higher than that of the Galaxy S25.</p>

<p>At the moment, current rumors indicate that Samsung once again doesn't plan to upgrade the camera system on the Galaxy S25. That would mean the flagship will ship with a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. By all indications, the OnePlus 13 should have the better camera system. With a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP ultrawide, and a periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, the OnePlus 13 looks to have better rear camera hardware in almost every way. Samsung could improve its image signal processing and computational photography to pull more out of the Galaxy S25's hardware, though.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 could also bring better connectivity options than the Galaxy S25, packing Wi-Fi 7, NFC, 5G, and Bluetooth 5.4. While we're hoping that the Galaxy S25 matches these specifications, that's uncertain.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13-performance-and-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13: Performance and software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa" name="oxygenos-15-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Theoretically, the OnePlus 13 and the Galaxy S25 should offer similar performance, since they are both powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Performance will be great on both devices, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is significantly improved compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It's always possible that Samsung manages to tune the Snapdragon 8 Elite to get more performance and optimization out of it, as the company has done in the past.</p><p>Both phones will be powered by Android 15, but different skins. The OnePlus 13 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, while the Galaxy S25 will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">One UI 7</a>. At the end of the day, which one you prefer will come down to preference. However, the Galaxy S25 has more AI features and will get longer software support. Samsung is expected to pledge seven years of OS upgrades, but OnePlus is only giving OnePlus 13 buyers four years of OxygenOS upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-look-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An angled, rumored rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j694D5wu5mdb9MzUKqC72V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is creating some uncertainty, and we don't know exactly how much the Galaxy S25 or OnePlus 13 will cost. If the OnePlus 13 can match or near the Galaxy S25's price point, it has a good chance of earning a recommendation.</p><p>With a bigger screen and better camera hardware, the OnePlus 13 could be a Galaxy S25 Ultra alternative available at Galaxy S25 pricing. Until we test these phones for ourselves, we won't know for sure. Luckily, we'll learn more about both of these phones' US pricing and availability next month.</p>

<ul><li>The Solos AirGo Vision, first announced in July, are finally available for purchase from Solos' website and Amazon.</li><li>The modular smart glasses feature swappable frames with and without a camera.</li><li>Like prior Solos glasses, the AirGo Vision are characterized by a comfortable, lightweight design.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Solos promised that its next pair of smart glasses, powered by ChatGPT-4o, would arrive at some point this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/solos-airgo-vision-launch">when they were first announced in July</a>. As the year comes to a close, the company is making good on that promise â€” the brand-new Solos AirGo Vision are available starting today, Dec. 10, from Solos' official website and Amazon. The camera-equipped glasses are modular, allowing users to swap frames in and out based on their needs.</p><p>The prior Solos AirGo 3 glasses were unique in that each temple was modular, connecting to the main part of the frame with a USB-C port and connector. That introduced new possibilities, such as the ability to charge the glasses either with a proprietary cable or a standard USB-C cable.</p><p>With the new AirGo Vision, Solos is taking this modular smart glasses concept to the next level. It's selling the AirGo Vision with and without camera-equipped frames â€” meaning you can wear the same pair of glasses as audio-only smart glasses (like the AirGo 3) or camera-enabled smart glasses (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>). A complete kit, including a camera frame and a standard frame, costs $349. The camera frame is available for $299 by itself, and the frame only retails for $149.</p><p>Solos' latest offering is a new way of thinking about wearable privacy. Instead of turning a switch and hoping your glasses aren't on, you can literally remove the camera from the AirGo Vision thanks to their modularity. Additionally, the company seems to have preserved much of what we loved about the AirGo 3, like the lightweight design. Both styles, Krypton 1 and Krypton 2, weight just 42 grams. By comparison, the heaviest Ray-Ban Meta frames weigh nearly 51 grams.</p>

<p>"One thing we promised to deliver on was allowing consumers to have control of their experience with AI and smart technology, particularly with privacy options in mind," said Kenneth Fan, who is a co-founder of Solos, in a press release. "That's why we developed frames that can easily be changed to decide when and where a camera may be appropriate without sacrificing any of the fun features."</p><p>Aside from their modularity, the Solos AirGo Vision pack <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">ChatGPT-4o</a> support for visual processing. The company also says that other frameworks, such as Claude and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, are available. It claims that you can get more than 2,500 AI interactions  on a single charge.</p><p>Crucially, Solos fixed one of the biggest flaws with its AirGo 3 glasses. Now, after opening the companion app once, you'll be able to use AI features on the AirGo Vision with the app running in the background. This solves arguably the biggest inconvenience with using the AirGo 3, and makes the AirGo Vision a much more capable competitor to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p><p>You can find the AirGo Vision at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://solosglasses.com/" target="_blank">Solos' website</a> and at Amazon starting now.</p>

<ul><li>Google had been developing the "Pixel Tablet Pen" with global certifications already underway before the Pixel Tablet 2 was canceled.</li><li>The pen was set to come in white and gray, matching the Pixel Tablet 2â€™s colors, and featured a button to open a note-taking app.</li><li>Designed to attach magnetically to an official keyboard (which was also canceled), the pen included Find My Device integration to help locate it if lost.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Pixel Tabletâ€™s USI 2.0 stylus support intrigued many at launch, but the absence of a first-party pen left users puzzled. Turns out, Google was developing its own Pixel Tablet Pen before quietly abandoning the project. Insider information shared with Android Authority now uncovers what couldâ€™ve been the Pixel Tablet's stylus.</p><p>According to reliable leaker Kamila Wojciechowska via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-tablet-pen-3506445/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google had been working on an official stylus for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. The plan was to launch it alongside the much-anticipated Pixel Tablet 2â€”<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">until that project was scrapped a few weeks back</a>.</p><p>The Pen for Google Pixel Tablet (its official name), codenamed "bushukan" or "B80," was deep into development, with global certifications already in progress, per the report.</p><p>While the future of the Pixel Tablet Pen is still unclear, the latest leak has uncovered some interesting details about this accessory.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet Pen was set to come in two colorsâ€”white and grayâ€”likely matching the Pixel Tablet 2â€™s color options. It also featured a handy button on top to quickly open a note-taking app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.43%;"><img id="gqmDRMvWuCvsePzUaYF2SB" name="Pixel-Tablet-Pen" alt="Pen for the Pixel Tablet launching a note taking app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqmDRMvWuCvsePzUaYF2SB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="840" height="432" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, users couldâ€™ve easily written straight into text fields, and the device wouldâ€™ve converted it into typed text on the fly with Gboard's handwriting recognition.</p><p>A video from Android Authority highlights the Pixel Tablet Penâ€™s basic stylus features. It was designed to magnetically attach to an official keyboard accessoryâ€”another project that got canceled. Plus, the pen had Find My Device integration, making it easy to track down if it got lost.</p><p>Even though the Pixel Tablet 2 was apparently canceled, Google is still all in on the original Pixel Tablet. Recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/vpn-by-google-could-finally-come-to-the-pixel-tablet-in-android-15-qpr2">upgrades like VPN by Google</a> are a strong indication of this commitment.</p><p>While the pen's design and features are interesting, they donâ€™t seem to offer much more than existing USI 2.0 styluses.</p><p>Nonetheless, the leaked Pen for Google Pixel Tablet could be another cool addition for current tablet owners, especially with its color options matching the Hazel and Porcelain shades.</p>

This AI-focused chipset aimed at mid-range Android phones offers a 20% faster CPU, 40% faster GPU, 30% better AI performance, and 12% more power efficiency.</p><p>Thus, the Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> built-in alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature and other AI-powered features across the interface and in the photography segment.</p><p>Unlike recent Android phones that are going for a flat design, Redmi chose to stick to the slimmer form factor with a curved screen on the edges, with the back also embracing a similar design aesthetic. It has a sizable visor featuring a triple camera setup, including a 50MP primary sensor, a 50MP telephoto sensor, and an 8MP ultrawide-angle lens. For selfies, the device has a 20MP punch-hole selfie camera.</p>

Additional perks include a vapor chamber cooling system, 4K video recording, dual stereo speakers, and an IP68 rating.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is beginning to roll out its Android 15-based OxygenOS 15 update to the original OnePlus Pad.</li><li>The update is now becoming available in India in batches, and will reach North America and Europe next week.</li><li>The move comes following the latest OnePlus Pad 2 getting the boost to OxygenOS 15 last month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus' last-generation tablet is starting to get the upgrade to Android 15. The OnePlus Pad is currently receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> update â€” based on Android 15 â€” in batches, starting in India. The company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1747432716451708936" target="_blank">post</a> on the OnePlus community forum that the update would become available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> users in North America and Europe next week. This gradual release timeline lines up with that of the OnePlus devices that have already gotten the boost to OxygenOS 15.</p><p>Compared to the brand's competitors, notably Samsung, OnePlus has brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its devices at a quick and consistent pace. The OnePlus 12 was first to receive OxygenOS 15, followed by the OnePlus Open and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, among other devices.</p><p>Notably, the company has been relatively quiet about its timeline for bringing Android 15 to the OnePlus Pad Go, its budget tablet. Based on its software support promise, the Pad Go is expected to receive OxygenOS 15, and the first-generation OnePlus Pad gaining support could be a step in the right direction.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FoC8D2deFTizcsLyRvCfDa" name="oxygenos-15-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoC8D2deFTizcsLyRvCfDa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In India, the build number for OxygenOS 15 on the OnePlus Pad is <strong>OPD2203_15.0.0.301(EX01)</strong>. OnePlus also shared rollback steps for reverting the OnePlus Pad to Android 14 with a Local OTA update in case users have trouble with Android 15. You can find the complete rollback instructions, plus updates on the North American and European rollout, on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1747432716451708936" target="_blank">community post</a>.</p><p>The OxygenOS 15 update for the OnePlus Pad includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-is-rolling-out-to-the-oneplus-pad-2-this-week-heres-whats-new">all the features and changes that the OnePlus Pad 2 received last month</a>, plus a few extras. Notably, the update adds support for the operating system's new multitasking gestures. Using these gestures, you can create a floating window by pulling down a notification banner, and similarly open an app in full-screen view by pulling down on a floating window. When you're finished, you can close a floating window by swiping up or hide it by swiping to the side.</p><p>Additionally, the update brings new AI features to the OnePlus Pad, including AI Notes and AI Retouch. OnePlus also touts the new animations and rendering effects bundled with this OxygenOS update, which is designed to create a "consistent scrolling experience" with "luminous rendering effects" also in tow.</p><p>Users in India can expect to see OxygenOS 15 become available on their OnePlus Pad starting now, with a wider global availability set to arrive next week.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve been trying to compare Visible vs. T-Mobile but can&apos;t seem to decide which one to go with, we don&apos;t blame you. Choosing a wireless service provider isn&apos;t exactly a cakewalk these days, especially with the &apos;Big Three&apos; facing increasingly tough competition from some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier" target="_blank">best MVNO carriers</a> out there. No matter what your requirements or budget, there is no dearth of options in the market.</p><p>Of course, Visible and T-Mobile are two such options. While the former is a no-contract service provider offering just two prepaid plans, the latter is a mainstream carrier having no less than five full-featured plans. Visible&apos;s plans let you save quite a lot of money, but they stick to the basics. On the other hand, T-Mobile&apos;s plans pack a plethora of perks, but they also cost significantly more. There are several other factors worth taking into consideration as well, including everything from network coverage to device compatibility. So, the question is, which one is the better fit for your needs? Let&apos;s see how these two service providers stack up against each other and find out.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-visible-apos-s-plans-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Visible&apos;s plans</h2>
<p>Offering just two straightforward plans, Visibleâ€”which is owned and operated by Verizonâ€”keeps things exceedingly simple. Its basic plan is just called Visible, and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon&apos;s combined 5G/LTE network. You also get unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at a speed of 5Mbps, as well talk & text to Mexico and Canada. Even with all that, the starter Visible plan costs a mere $25 per month, that too with all the taxes and fees included.</p>

<p>Then there&apos;s the higher plan, which is called Visible Plus. Along with all the benefits of the basic Visible plan, it unlocks access to Verizon&apos;s super-fast &apos;Ultra-Wideband&apos; 5G network, 50GB of premium data, unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at an increased speed of 10Mbps, and 2GB of daily data in Mexico and Canada. Priced at $45 per monthâ€”again with all the taxes and fees includedâ€”Visible Plus further adds international calling to over 30 countries and unlimited texting to more than 200 countries around the world.</p><p>Although the monthly prices for both plans are quite affordable, you can save even more if you decide to pay for a full year of service in advance.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-t-mobile-apos-s-plans-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: T-Mobile&apos;s plans</h2>
<p>With T-Mobile, you get a total of five primary plans to pick from, with all of them offering a number of common benefits. These include unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier&apos;s nationwide 5G/LTE network, unlimited shared mobile hotspot usage at 3G speeds, usage in Mexico and Canada, no annual service contract, and access to exclusive perks via T-Mobile Tuesdays.</p><p>Starting things off is the Essentials Saver plan, which costs $55 per month (before all the taxes and fees) for a single line and gives you 50GB of premium data on T-Mobile&apos;s high-speed &apos;Ultra-Capacity&apos; 5G network. You also get SD quality (480p) video streaming, unlimited data at up to 128Kbps in Mexico and Canada, and roaming usage in over 215 countries. The next plan is just called Essentials and costs $65 per month (excluding all the taxes and fees) for a single line. Interestingly, it offers exactly the same benefits as Essentials Saver, with the only difference being a higher number of lines eligible for multi-line discounts.</p>

<p>Then you have the Go5G plan, which offers 100GB of premium data, along with 15GB of dedicated high-speed mobile hotspot data. Priced at $80 per month (including all the taxes and fees) for one line, it also bundles up to HD quality (720p) video streaming, 10GB of high-speed data in Mexico and Canada, and six months of Apple TV+ subscription. The two highest plansâ€”Go5G Plus and Go5G Nextâ€”unlock access to unlimited premium data, 50GB of dedicated high-speed mobile hotspot data, device upgrades, and up to UHD quality (4K) video streaming, while also throwing a number of additional goodies (e.g., up to 15GB of high-speed data in Mexico and Canada, in-flight connectivity, and T-Mobile Scam Shield Premium) into the mix. Go5G Plus and Go5G Next are priced $95 per month and $105 per month, respectively for one line â€“ with both prices being inclusive of all the taxes and fees.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that all of the above-mentioned prices are before relevant autopay discounts, and you can save even more by signing up for multiple lines. T-Mobile also offers many of these plans at reduced prices to senior citizens (aged 55 years and above), military personnel and veterans, as well as first responders.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-network-coverage-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Network coverage</h2>
<p>As a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, Visible uses the network infrastructure of Verizon, its parent company. Verizon&apos;s primary low-band <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-verizon-everything-you-need-know" target="_blank">5G network</a> offers fairly reliable nationwide coverage, with the carrier&apos;s legacy LTE network filling in the gaps wherever necessary. This means that you can get more-than-decent speeds just about everywhere, including in rural areas, even if you go for the base Visible plan.</p><p>However, it&apos;s the carrier&apos;s mid-band 5G network (including the C-band) that gives you blazing-fast speeds, in case you get the Visible Plus plan. This &apos;Ultra-Wideband&apos; 5G network isn&apos;t as widespread as the low-band network, but with continued deployment, it&apos;s bound to get better in future.</p>

<p>Talking about T-Mobile, the carrier&apos;s network infrastructure is arguably the best among the &apos;Big Three&apos; wireless service providers. You can expect excellent low-band 5G network coverage throughout the United States, regardless of the plan you go for. The mid-band &apos;Ultra-Capacity&apos; 5G network is also significantly better than the competition, although you might face some issues in rural areas.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-phone-compatibility-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Phone compatibility</h2>
<p>Although Visible sells a number of smartphones through its website, but the selection is somewhat limited. That being said, you have quite a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phones-visible" target="_blank">phones that&apos;ll work</a> with the MVNO just fine, since it ultimately utilizes Verizon&apos;s network.</p><p>While that&apos;s a good thing, Visible just can&apos;t match up to T-Mobile when it comes to device compatibility. As a matter of fact, nearly all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> will work sans any issues on T-Mobile&apos;s network. These include top-tier flagships such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, affordable options like the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, and everything in between.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GM9wfbo57GPzC8pvWWpMdH" name="OnePlus-Nord-N30-5G-back-01.jpg" alt="The shiny back of the OnePlus Nord N30 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GM9wfbo57GPzC8pvWWpMdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Both Visible and T-Mobile also let you bring your own unlocked phone, as long as it&apos;s compatible. To that end, you can simply enter your smartphone&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-imei-number-your-phone" target="_blank">IMEI number</a> on the online compatibility checker tool provided by each carrier and see if it&apos;ll work.</p>
<h2 id="visible-vs-t-mobile-which-should-you-go-for-2">Visible vs. T-Mobile: Which should you go for?</h2>
<p>Comparing Visible vs. T-Mobile and everything that they offer, it&apos;s evident that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to picking a wireless service provider. As an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-important-considerations-when-switching-mvno" target="_blank">MVNO</a>, Visible primarily focuses on maximizing your savings. Its two plans have all the essentials, along with some nice bonus features. Conversely, T-Mobile is a traditional carrier that simply gives you more. Its five main plans not only include all the basics but also come bundled with a diverse range of perks such as streaming services, in-flight connectivity, and much more. There&apos;s no wrong choice here, but we suggest going for the option that suits your individual use case the best.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rg4kH5hDsQySpeWHhuaqN9" name="visible website on phone.jpg" alt="visible website on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rg4kH5hDsQySpeWHhuaqN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2016" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rajat Sharma / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want to get the most bang for your buck(s) and don&apos;t care about things like high-speed mobile hotspot functionality and regular phone upgrades, go ahead and get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review" target="_blank">Visible</a>. Its base plan offers exceptional value, and you can even get premium data and solid international usage benefits by paying only a little more. That being said, Visible works well only if you want to sign up for one line, as there are no multi-line discounts available with it.</p><p>However, if money is no object and you simply want the most out of your wireless service, we suggest going for T-Mobile. Yes, it doesn&apos;t come cheap, but even the base plans give you loads of high-speed data access, unlimited texting while roaming in hundreds of countries across the globe, and multi-line savings. If you sign up for one of the higher plans, you also get additional goodies like subscription services and up to UHD quality (4K) video streaming support.</p>

<p>The tradition of OnePlus' staggered flagship launches continues, and the OnePlus 13 is the worst-kept secret in tech. While the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-global-launch-window-for-the-oneplus-13-and-its-soon">won't be officially unveiled in North America until January</a>, it's already available in China, and that means we know almost everything about it. So, how does it compare to Google's best Android flagship, the Pixel 9 Pro XL?</p><p>For now, a big unknown is the price of the OnePlus 13 in the US, which will likely be a significant factor in whether it's better or worse than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Historically, OnePlus phones have been cheaper than most other flagships, but that isn't guaranteed to continue. Both phones have a lot going for them â€” the Pixel 9 Pro XL has software and AI, meanwhile the OnePlus 13 has raw power and better hardware â€” and we're here to help you decide which is right for you.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-back-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Pixel 8 Pro and 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TzbPJGZazXSa6yPQ2gCknn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> couldn't look more different, or at least, they're as different as two smartphones can be in 2024. While both are fairly rectangular with slight curves around the corners, they're differentiated by their camera housings. OnePlus went with its unmistakable circular camera housing, which holds the triple-camera system and flash. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a pill-shaped camera bar at the top of the phone's back. Additionally, the camera circle on the back of the OnePlus 13 isn't symmetrically positioned.</p><p>Both phones have similar screen sizes and dimensions, too. The OnePlus 13 sports a 6.82-inch display and measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5-8.9 mm. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch panel with dimensions of 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm. In other words, these two devices will feel pretty similar in the hand, although the OnePlus 13 is marginally larger.</p><p>Technically, the OnePlus 13 is more durable than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, as it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">rated IP69 for dust and water resistance</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is only rated for IP68, but you should know that the difference probably won't matter. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP68 still covers brief submersion in shallow water</a>, and IP69 only takes that a step further, offering protection against high-pressure and high-temperature water jet sprays. You probably won't ever need that level of water resistance on your phone, though it certainly can't hurt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.72%;"><img id="kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo" name="op-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1780" height="885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 can either be equipped with a glass back or an eco-leather silicone polymer back. It'll be available in black, blue, and white colorways. The Pixel 9 Pro XL comes in a few more colors and is only available with a glass back. You can choose from Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, and Obsidian colorways.</p><p>It's worth noting that, at 210 or 213 grams, the OnePlus 13 will feel noticeably heavier than the 199-gram Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 13 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW" name="OnePlus-13" alt="OnePlus 13 back camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A theme of this comparison will be that the OnePlus 13 will often win on the spec sheet, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL may still be the winner in daily use. For example, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which uses the same custom Oryon cores that Qualcomm developed for its laptop-class chips. By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip in the Pixel 9 Pro XL is significantly less powerful, even if it may be better optimized for Google's hardware.</p><p>It's a similar story for the display. The sizes are similar, at 6.82 inches for OnePlus 13 and 6.8 inches for the Pixel 9 Pro XL. They're also both OLED screens capable of reaching 120Hz refresh rates. However, the OnePlus 13 will be brighter thanks to its 4,500-nit peak brightness rating. The Pixel 9 Pro XL tops out at 3,000 nits. If past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> are any indication of the OnePlus 13's brightness, the difference between these two displays should be noticeable in daily use.</p><p>Both phones use hole-punch, front-facing cameras. The OnePlus 13 has a 32MP, f/2.4 lens, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 42MP, f/2.2 lens. We'll have to test these phones side-by-side for ourselves before we tell you which camera is best.</p>

<p>For the rear cameras, there are a lot of similarities. Both phones use a 50MP main camera with similar apertures. Additionally, the OnePlus 13's 50MP ultra wide camera and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's 48MP wide camera match up well. However, there's a big difference in zoom performance. The Pixel 9 Pro XL provides 5x optical zoom, while the OnePlus 13 only provides 3x optical zoom.</p><p>OnePlus continues its battery and charging dominance with the OnePlus 13. It brings a massive 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired charging. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's 5,060mAh battery and 37W wired charging speeds are fine, but don't compare to the OnePlus 13's offerings.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, the OnePlus 13 and Pixel 9 Pro XL both support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, 5G, and NFC. The former supports Bluetooth 5.4, while the latter only supports Bluetooth 5.3.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15, which is based on Android 15</a>. It'll get security updates for five years, but OxygenOS upgrades for only four years. That's a low number, considering Google offers seven years of full OS upgrades on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. However, you may not want to make a purchasing decision based on software support alone because we don't know what Android will look like on the Pixel 9 Pro XL in seven years. It's still a gamble.</p><p>One area where the Pixel 9 Pro XL decisively beats the OnePlus 13 is in AI. From features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> to apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel Screenshots</a> to features like Add Me â€” the Pixel has it all. While OnePlus is starting to catch up, if you want AI, you should still buy a Pixel.</p>

<p>For now, the "sure thing" recommendation is the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's a rock-solid phone at a decent price with tons of software support. We still haven't tried the OnePlus 13 for ourselves and are missing key details about the handset, namely its US pricing. As such, it's impossible to recommend the OnePlus 13 today.</p><p>However, I'm optimistic that the OnePlus 13 â€” with a more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and better hardware in a few key areas â€” could dethrone the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it launches in January. If you can wait a month to see what the OnePlus 13 will hold, you should.</p>
