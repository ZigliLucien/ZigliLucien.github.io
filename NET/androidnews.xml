                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Imagine a world where your phone understands your needs before you even say them, where your fitness tracker personalizes your workout routine in real-time, or where your smart home adjusts the temperature based on your mood. This future is closer than you think, thanks to the growing power of on-device AI processing.</p><p>But what exactly is on-device AI processing? In simpler terms, it means running artificial intelligence algorithms directly on a device, like your smartphone or smartwatch, instead of relying on remote servers in the cloud. This local processing unlocks a range of benefits that are transforming the way we interact with technology.</p>
<p>Many of the new AI features you hear so much about use on-device processing. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a> leverage specialty-built microprocessors and phone hardware to run features locally, though the exact requirements are still a little up in the air.</p><p>For example, Samsung offers the full suite of Galaxy AI features on the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> line, but Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">doesn&apos;t provide the same access to local processing</a> on the smaller Pixel 8 with less RAM. It&apos;s speculated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">12GB of memory is required</a> to process an LLM (large language model), but neither Samsung nor Google have confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-on-device-ai-matter-2">Why does on-device AI matter?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The shift towards on-device AI processing brings several key advantages:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> By keeping user data on the device itself, on-device AI minimizes risk and ensures greater user control over personal information. This is especially important for sensitive data like facial recognition or health records.</li><li><strong>Faster Performance:</strong> Cloud-based AI relies on sending data back and forth between your device and a server. This communication can introduce latency, causing delays in response times. On-device AI eliminates this delay, leading to a smoother, more responsive user experience.</li><li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> Not everywhere has reliable internet access. On-device AI allows AI-powered features to work even when you're offline. Imagine using voice commands to control your smart home while camping, or translating languages on the go without needing a data connection.</li><li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> Since data processing happens locally, on-device AI reduces the attack surface for hackers. This is crucial for applications dealing with sensitive information, like financial transactions or medical diagnoses.</li><li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Constantly transmitting data to the cloud can drain your battery. On-device AI processing reduces reliance on the cloud, leading to improved battery life on your devices.</li></ul>
<p>Because of these benefits, on-device AI is already making waves in various industries. On your phone, facial recognition for unlocking, voice assistants like Siri and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and personalized camera filters are all powered by on-device AI.</p><p>On-device AI allows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">smart speakers</a> to understand your voice commands more accurately and personalize your home environment based on your preferences and habits. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">Fitness trackers</a> can analyze your movement patterns and heart rate data in real-time to provide personalized coaching and activity recommendations.</p>
<p>Outside the general consumer market, on-device AI is also at play in ways you probably wouldn&apos;t consider. Self-driving cars rely heavily on on-device AI for real-time object recognition, pathfinding, and collision avoidance. In factories and assembly plants, on-device AI allows connected devices to make decisions locally, optimizing performance and reducing reliance on centralized servers.</p><p>If a "smart" computer can make a difference, doing it locally is preferred. It&apos;s faster, less dependent on "outside" forces like internet connectivity, and allows for easier corrections.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The potential of on-device AI processing is huge. As device processors become more powerful and AI models become smaller and more efficient, we can expect even more sophisticated applications to emerge.</p><p>Possibilities include better context-aware computing, where your phone anticipates your needs based on your location, time of day, and past behavior. It could automatically adjust settings, recommend apps, or provide relevant information without you even asking.</p>
<p>AI could analyze your preferences and habits across various applications, offering a truly personalized user experience that adapts to your evolving needs. It can also make security features more robust — AI could better look for anomalies during fingerprint detection or facial scanning. You wouldn&apos;t want features like these to work via the cloud.</p><p>On-device AI processing is still in its early stages, but it will play a major role in shaping the future of technology. By offering greater privacy, faster performance, and improved security, on-device AI paves the way for a more intelligent and user-centric future.</p>

Not only that, but if you want to document the event on your smartphone, you&apos;ll also need something to protect your device&apos;s camera lens. Fortunately, we found a pair of solar eclipse glasses that do both, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ44VN7J"><strong>they&apos;re only $7.64 during Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale</strong></a>. </p>

<p>If you plan on watching the historic solar eclipse on April 8th, don't forget to protect yourself with a pair of solar glasses. Currently 15% off during Amazon's Big Spring Sale, these disposable shades from Medical King can also be converted into a filter that protects your phone from damage if you want to film or photograph the event. Each pack comes with five glasses that you can share with friends and family, along with an informative guide book.</p>
<p>Despite claims from the manufacturer, it's worth noting that we haven't tested the effectiveness of these glasses as a filter for your phone camera. They've been certified to protect your eyes during the event, but it's hard to know how the pictures will turn out. Still, we'll be trying it once April 8th rolls around, and at only $8, it's a small investment. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ44VN7J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6d7978d8-c976-41c9-9810-43b3a71afea2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$8.99" data-dimension48="$8.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-spring-sale-2024-early-deals-predictions-and-what-to-expect"><strong>Amazon's Big Spring Sale is LIVE:</strong> these are the deals we'd buy</a></li></ul>
<p>For less than 10 bucks, you&apos;ll get five eclipse glasses that are designed to be cut and folded to fit around your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>&apos; camera lens. The frames are constructed from cardstock, so they aren&apos;t exactly suitable for repeated or long-term use, but the filtered lenses have been certified to meet standards set by the American Astronomical Society, so your eyes (and your devices) will be safe.</p><p>From a personal standpoint, I used eclipse glasses just like these during the 2017 eclipse, and I&apos;m not being hyperbolic when I say that they&apos;re worth every penny. If you live anywhere close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/news/live/solar-eclipse-live-updates">zone of totality</a> on April 8th, take the drive and go watch the event. You won&apos;t be sorry, and thanks to this Amazon deal, your bank account won&apos;t be either.</p>

<ul><li>Google Health has provided an update on Fitbit Labs at The Checkup 2024 event.</li><li>Fitbit Labs will use a Personal Health Large Language Model to help users understand their data better.</li><li>The feature is set to become available later this year to a limited number of Android users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit Labs was first teased to us at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> launch event in 2023. Now, we have a few more insights into what Fitbit Labs has to offer and who stands to benefit from it.</p><p>At the recent Google Health <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7-Bi6t-iYU">The Checkup</a> event (as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/fitbit-labs-personal-health-llm/">9to5 Google</a>), it was revealed that users who are eligible to try Fitbit Labs will be able to test a variety of AI features. Most notable is the introduction of an AI-powered chatbot that aims to give users the ability to better understand the data collected by their Fitbits by using a “freeform chat space.” </p>
<p>According to Florence Thng, Google Director of Product: “Our users want tools to help them connect the dots within their health data so that they can better understand their personal health metrics.” In turn, the hope is that this can be turned into actionable advice for users, “where you have access to an on-demand personal coach that can provide you with daily guidance.”</p><p>The chatbot itself is powered by a Personal Health Large Language Model that’s being developed by Google Research and Fitbit. The AI is a “fine-tuned version of our Gemini model…using high-quality research case studies." </p>

<p>Examples of how this could help users included analyzing variations in sleep patterns and quality before making recommendations on the intensity or timing of your next workout, as well as providing more tailored insights around metrics such as heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and exercise intensity. </p><p>Google confirmed that it will be sharing more research “soon,” which should allow users to better understand how the model is built and how accurate the results are likely to be.</p><p>It was also confirmed that Fitbit Labs features will be “available for testing for a limited number of Android users who are enrolled in the Fitbit Labs program in the mobile app.” At this stage, it&apos;s unclear exactly which eligible Android users will be given priority to test these new features.

For example, you can currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C63KD7JP"><strong>score a whopping 20% discount</strong></a> on the Galaxy Z Flip 5, knocking the price of the unlocked foldable down to $799 for the duration of the sale. </p><p>That&apos;s a return to the record low price we saw on the phone last December, and it&apos;s further proof that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-spring-sale-2024-early-deals-predictions-and-what-to-expect">Amazon Spring Sale</a> really isn&apos;t messing around when it comes to major discounts on tech. The sale is scheduled to run through March 25th, so if you&apos;re interested in getting your hands on a cutting-edge foldable, don&apos;t wait too long. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5f1901fd-843c-41e4-b7f2-fdbb45b5506d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C63KD7JP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:128.38%;"><img id="GiLCds6NfHCa9b8XJMdVsi" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-render-black-front-and-back.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GiLCds6NfHCa9b8XJMdVsi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1110" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C63KD7JP" data-dimension112="5f1901fd-843c-41e4-b7f2-fdbb45b5506d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99"><del>$999.99</del><strong> $799.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Head to Amazon during this week's Big Spring Sale and you'll get a straight $200 off the price of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, one of our favorite foldable phones ever made. For 800 bucks, you're getting an unlocked device with a sleek flip-phone design, two gorgeous AMOLED displays, and an efficient Snapdragon chip that handles most tasks with ease. Amazon is even offering up to $401 of trade-in credit (in the form of a gift card) when you send in an old or broken device.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C63KD7JP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5f1901fd-843c-41e4-b7f2-fdbb45b5506d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you enjoy using compact or flip-style foldable phones; you like buying your mobile devices unlocked; you take a lot of selfies. </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait until the release of the Z Flip 6 (presumably this summer); you don&apos;t like using Samsung phones. </p><p>We once called the Z Flip 5 the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phone</a> for most users", namely due to its balance of innovation with a relatively accessible price tag. Its compact flip-phone construction means that the Z Flip 5 is far more affordable than the Galaxy Z Fold 5 or Pixel Fold, but you still get a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, a stunning new cover display, and a convenient, super-pocketable form factor. </p><p>Unless you&apos;re super committed to buying this Samsung foldable, there are a few things to consider before making your purchase. For one, keep in mind that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will probably arrive some time this summer (likely late July or early August), so if you&apos;re willing to wait five or six months to buy your new phone, it could be worth it. </p><p>Additionally, the Z Flip 5 has a major competitor in the form of the Motorola Razr Plus (2023). The debate has been raging for months now, so it might be worth checking out our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Z Flip 5 vs Razr Plus</a> if you&apos;re still on the fence. After all, the Amazon Spring Sale is currently knocking the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2XF43BD"><strong>Motorola flip phone down to $699</strong></a>, a full $100 cheaper than its Samsung rival. You really can&apos;t go wrong either way, but ultimately, the choice is yours. </p>

<ul><li>Threads is rolling out a feature called "Trending Now," which will show users the top five trending topics on the platform at a given time. </li><li>The addition makes Threads more equivalent to X (formerly Twitter) in terms of functionality. </li><li>Meta began testing trending topics on Threads over a month ago, but the feature is now rolling out to all users in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Threads, Meta&apos;s text-based social media app, is gaining a critical feature that will make the platform more comparable to X (formerly Twitter). Starting March 19, users in the U.S. can view trending topics on Threads in the app. It works much like the trending tab on X, albeit with fewer topics listed. Still, it&apos;s likely to end up being a positive addition to Threads. </p><p>The topics will be found in the "Trending Now" section of the app, which can be viewed in the Search tab and the For You page. It&apos;s still rudimentary because you can only see five topics in the "Trending Now" list. The app also can&apos;t sort trending topics into categories, as X can with categories like sports or entertainment. Still, it&apos;s a better way to discover new content on Threads in close to real-time.</p><p>In a post on Threads, Mark Zuckerberg described Trending Now as a way to "see what people are talking about on Threads."</p>

<p>Meta began testing the Trending Now section of the Threads app over a month ago, starting with a small batch of users in the U.S. At the time, Zuckerberg pledged to "roll it out in more countries and languages once we get it tuned up." Now, the feature is widely available in the U.S., but there&apos;s no further word on when it might come to more countries and languages.</p><p>The company shipped Threads last year as an extremely basic text-based social media platform. It rushed out the platform in order to capitalize on the defectors from X, who had left following Elon Musk&apos;s changes to the social media site. Due to these reasons, Threads debuted without many essential features. Meta has worked on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-by-instagram-gets-update-for-ios">adding these features retroactively over time</a>, such as hashtags and now trending topics. </p><p>Meta could be hoping that adding Trending now to Threads will make it a better source for following and gathering news. Even after Musk&apos;s changes to X, it is still the top platform for following breaking news. In part, that is because it can be hard to follow trends on Threads. The addition of trending topics will bring Threads a bit closer to X in that regard. </p><p>You can try out Trending Topics on Threads, which is starting now in the U.S.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy Ring may offer customized diet advice for users.</li><li>The Ring is rumored to integrate with Samsung Food to offer a meal planning service.</li><li>Meal recommendations could be based on the health information collected by the Galaxy Ring.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> is Samsung’s first foray into the smart ring market. And, after providing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">close-up look at the Galaxy Ring at MWC</a>, expectations are high for when it finally arrives later in 2024. Now, it looks as though the Galaxy Ring will provide diet and nutrition advice that could put it ahead of its competitors in this growing sector.</p><p>A report from the Korean publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2024/03/19/7TQEPLAGQVE3RNPFS3SMT4D7DU/">Chosun Biz</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-custom-meals-feature-3427156/">Android Authority</a>) suggests that the Galaxy Ring will work in tandem with Samsung Food to provide wearers with customized diet advice. This includes “optimized recipes and diets based on information such as calorie consumption and body mass index”.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-food-app-launch">Samsung Food</a> was launched back in 2019 and is currently available in 8 languages across 104 countries. The AI-driven service provides users with thousands of recipes and can amend those recipes to suit individual dietary requirements. It can also analyze the contents of a Galaxy Ring user’s fridge to make meal recommendations. It could (in theory) send the recipe to their smart Samsung oven, which could automatically set the cooking time and temperature as required. </p>

<p>The report goes on to suggest that the Galaxy Ring and Samsung Food could go one step further by integrating with Samsung’s e-food food delivery service (currently only available in South Korea), which could help users order any missing ingredients. Chosun Biz quotes an anonymous commentator who says that by doing this, “Samsung Electronics will be able to link and expand the food delivery business to the world.”</p><p>This wouldn’t be the first time Samsung has tried to create this type of service. Samsung has been trying a food recommendation service based on data from some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a> wearers in South Korea, so the software evidently already exists for this. Whether it would persuade Galaxy Ring wearers to switch all their Samsung appliances is another question, however.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is expected to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-release-unit-production-rumor">released in the summer</a>, with an official unveiling at July’s Unpacked event highly anticipated. </p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is undoubtedly the best Android smartwatch around.

<p>Most students don&apos;t usually have a lot of money at hand. Even when working part-time jobs, it&apos;s draining to maintain your studies as well. Therefore, budget-friendly smartwatches like the Amazfit GTS 4 are optimal choices for students with a tight wallet.</p><p>At almost $70 to $100 cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, the GTS 4 gives you big bang for your buck. You get health trackers and fitness measuring features, as well as Alexa, speakers, a mic, and onboard GPS. You also get phone notifications, basic first-party apps, and the ability to send basic responses to messages.</p><p>If you want an even cheaper and lighter version of the Amazfit GTS 4, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gts-4-mini-review">Amazfit GTS 4 Mini</a>. It looks identical but is actually a cheaper, stripped-down version of the GTS 4. It lacks some of the premium features of the GTS 4 but you get it for half the price, which is a big plus.</p>

<p>In its glory days, Fitbit was the go-to brand for all fitness-focused individuals. Following its acquisition by Google, the brand isn&apos;t as grand as it used to be. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> still stands as a worthy contender when it comes to the best smartwatches for students.</p><p>The most attractive features of the Versa 4 are its health-tracking options and incredible battery life. You also get NFC for payments, which is very convenient on the go. This is a very lightweight wearable, designed with comfort in mind. A student can wear the Versa 4 throughout the day, going through strenuous studies and co-curricular activities without feeling discomfort.</p><p>Although the Versa 4 isn&apos;t as cheap as you would hope, it does go on sale pretty often. We suggest students keep an eye out for discounts if planning on buying the Fitbit Versa 4.</p>

The watch uses a standard CR2025 cell which lasts for <em>an entire year</em>. And after that&apos;s used up, you can simply replace it another one of those cells.</p>

<h2 id="these-smartwatches-will-work-for-any-student-from-grown-adults-to-tiny-kids-2">These smartwatches will work for any student, from grown adults to tiny kids</h2>
<p>Choosing the best smartwatch for the young student in your life (or yourself) depends on a variety of factors. If you want an uncompromised experience that any adult would enjoy, our favorite smartwatch by far is the Galaxy Watch 6.</p><p>Wear OS 4 arguably has the best wearable software experience available today, but Samsung&apos;s One UI 5 Watch spin-off of Google&apos;s software comes in a close second. In either case, they&apos;ll help you stay apprised of any upcoming deadlines and important emails. </p><p>In general, students like the same features that anyone else would, varying from person to person. Jocks will prefer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> that gives them a way to closely track their progress — especially if they go from structured high school sports to training themselves in college. </p><p>In that case, something like the Fitbit Versa 4 would fit perfectly. But on the other end of the spectrum, some students will care more about form over function, making something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fossil-gen-6-review">Fossil Gen 6</a> the better choice.</p><p>Finally, you may specifically want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kid&apos;s smartwatch</a> that works independently so you don&apos;t have to buy them a smartphone, too. In that case, you&apos;ll find several options, starting with Garmin Bounce and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-vivofit-jr-3-review">Garmin Vivofit Jr. 3</a>. The former focuses on communication, the latter on fitness, so you can tailor your purchase to what your kid would enjoy.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a student (or guardian) and wondering where or how to start looking for the right smartwatch, a few simple questions can help you figure out what kind of product you need.</p>
<p><strong>What is your budget?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that&apos;ll help you identify the right pick is your budget. If you have the money for it, why not get the best overall smartwatch?</p>
<p><strong>How old are you (the student)?</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&apos;t make sense to get a Galaxy Watch 6 for a nine-year-old. In fact, that could be potentially dangerous. Even if you do have the money for it, get something age appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>What do you intend to use the smartwatch for?</strong></p>
<p>Students might need smartwatches for various reasons. If you&apos;re an athlete, then you&apos;re probably going to be using your watch for a lot of fitness tracking. Make sure your pick aligns with your day-to-day use.</p><p>Thinking along those lines, parents of younger school children might want to track their location to ensure their safety. As a guardian picking a watch for the young student in your life, don&apos;t forget to take the intended use of the wearable into account.</p>
<p><strong>What is your field of study?</strong></p>
<p>Students might not think of this right away, but this could be a very helpful question to ask yourself. Let&apos;s say you&apos;re a science students and tend to work in the lab a lot. You might need a smartwatch with above-average durability, or perhaps one that runs Wear OS so you can download loads of useful third-party apps such as a scientific calculator.</p><p>Based on your field of study, your final choice might differ. Think about the features that you will require the most on your journey as a student, and then make your final selection.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google expanded Pixel phone 5G availability to additional countries where previous models lacked 5G support.</li><li>With the addition of these new markets, the total count of supported regions now stands at 38, offering more choices for potential Pixel buyers.</li><li>Despite the expansion, Google does not officially sell its latest Pixel phones in the newly added markets, underscoring the complex distribution strategy of the company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google just added more countries where you can get your hands on the Pixel phones&apos; 5G connectivity.</p><p>The search giant has quietly turned on 5G for Pixel phones in more places where even models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series didn&apos;t originally support connectivity features like 5G, VoLTE, or Wi-Fi calling. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/google-pixel-5g-countries/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Google added seven new territories to the mix, such as Croatia, Iceland, Latvia, Greece, Hungary, Lichtenstein, and Slovakia.</p><p>Now, with these new additions, the total count of supported markets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pixel.withgoogle.com/5G/" target="_blank">stands at 38</a>. This means more choices for users eager to snag one of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">popular Android phones</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that Google doesn&apos;t actually sell its latest Pixel phones, like the Pixel 8 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, in any of these newly added markets.</p><p>As per 9to5, the Pixel 8 series is exclusively sold through official Google Stores in just 20 countries. These include Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Taiwan, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the United States.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear why the Mountain View-based tech giant is making this expansion, but it&apos;s likely that Google is broadening support in these areas due to a high number of people purchasing Pixels through unofficial channels in these countries.</p><p>In any case, this move should hopefully give Pixel owners a consistent connectivity experience as they move from one country to another.</p><p>Even so, Google Pixel&apos;s 5G availability still seems quite limited, with some regions like South America and Africa left out. Since 2020, users have been voicing concerns about the lack of universal Pixel 5G availability, and unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t seem to be changing anytime soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>A few years after Polar launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/polar-grit-x-smartwatch-review">Grit X Pro</a> smartwatch, the company is finally following up with an updated model, bringing a number of upgrades at a hefty price.</p><p>The Grit X2 Pro features a new rugged military-grade design with a casing made of stainless steel and sapphire glass covering the display for added protection. As for the display, Polar ditched the outdated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">MIP screen</a> for a larger and more vivid AMOLED panel, yet the watch still manages impressive battery life despite the increased power draw. That means up to 10 days in smartwatch mode, 43 hours in Performance Training mode, and 140 hours in Eco Training mode.</p>

<p>The Grit X2 Pro brings enhanced fitness training features for outdoor enthusiasts like trail runners and bikers, complete with 150 sports profiles. For example, the average ascent speed (VAM) provides insight into the rate at which you climb hills, while 3D speed combines your vertical speed and VAM to better calculate your true speed.</p><p>When you find yourself on a trail, Polar gives navigation a welcome boost thanks to dual GPS and support for various satellite systems. The Polar Grit X2 Pro also comes with a new Breadcrumbs feature, and users can now download maps for offline use with 32GB of built-in storage, meaning you&apos;ll always be able to find your way back.</p><p>The watch features Polar&apos;s Elixir biosensor, enabling a swathe of health tracking features, such as ECG, optical heart rate, SpO2, and skin temperature, for a more comprehensive view of various metrics. Combined with the various training modes and health tracking features, Polar says the Grit X2 Pro will offer users a more personalized experience to help them train, recover, and sleep better.</p>

<p>The Polar Grit X2 Pro is up for preorder starting on March 20 and goes on sale on April 3 for a whopping $749.90, significantly higher than the $499 starting price of the original Polar Grit X Pro. That price gets you the Night Black or Stone-Gray colorways, but you&apos;ll have to pay $50 more if you want the Grit X2 Pro Titan in Autumn Leather and Black Silicone.</p><p>Polar is also offering an $869.90 bundle deal that also throws in the H10 heart rate sensor, which we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">recently tested</a> alongside several fitness tracking devices.</p>

<p>Android is a free open-source operating system. The AOSP (<strong>A</strong>ndroid <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ource <strong>P</strong>roject) is free to download, free to alter, free to build into a product that can power just about anything. But it's not something you've ever used when you picked up a phone or other gizmo that runs "Android" because it's not really a complete operating system.</p>
<p>At its heart, Android is nothing more than a platform anyone can use to run applications bundled with the bits and pieces needed to talk to standard hardware. We tend to think of Android as an operating system for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> or tablet (or even a watch or television), but it&apos;s just a part of the software needed to get any device to turn on and do things. That being said, it&apos;s one of the most important parts.</p>
<p>Having a huge library of code that anyone can use is great. Having the things people build with it able to use the same applications is even better. </p><p>It&apos;s better for us because we will have a huge list of applications that work out of the box when we buy an Android-powered device. It&apos;s better for the companies making the devices because we&apos;ll want to buy them and they don&apos;t have to work to build a new application platform. It&apos;s also great for Google because it means more devices can use the internet and its services.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3" name="" alt="Android application framework" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3.png" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xae7RUWrWW5Mwu3xYkW3.png" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Source: Google </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That last part is why Google maintains the AOSP. Google was founded upon the belief that everyone should have access to the internet. While some of the reasons may be charitable and good-natured, Google has these goals mainly because the internet is how it makes money. All companies exist to make money, but with the AOSP, Google has found a new way to make money from everyone while giving away one of its most expensive products: Android.</p>
<p>This is done through the AOSP. Google <em>maintains</em> the Android source code. That means exactly what you think it does: It keeps things clean, tidy, and up-to-date, making it available for others. It also has people working full-time to make improvements and add new features to Android. But plenty of other companies, both phone manufacturers you&apos;ve heard of like Samsung and others you might not know, contribute to the code that powers Android. It&apos;s a true community effort.</p>
<p>All of this is made available for anyone to freely use under a liberal license that allows changes to be made to the code and not submitted back to the maintainers. This means Samsung can do <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">whatever it wants with the AOSP</a> and doesn&apos;t have to share what it has done with anyone. So are you, and so am I. If we do something different, we can keep those changes to ourselves to offer a (hopefully) better product than anyone else can or publish the changes so others can build upon them even further.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phones and gadgets we buy aren&apos;t running the AOSP as an operating system though. What we see is the result of someone or some company using it to create software that is unique and their own. This can be done by changing the code, adding even more code, or even adding applications that <em>aren&apos;t</em> open-sourced like the AOSP is. Every company that sells Android-powered gadgets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Google itself</a>, is doing this.</p>
<p>This fits into Google's methods to make money because there <em>are</em> some restrictions when a company wants to use Google's popular applications and services. If a company wants to include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google's mobile services</a> (and almost all phone makers do) it has to adhere to rules as a Google partner. Those rules make sure everyone knows about Google's money-making products.</p>
<p>The process is a circle. Google gives Android away. A company uses it on its phone. As consumers, we want Android phones that can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play</a> Gmail,  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, and all the other things that make Android great. The company making the phone can bundle those features in for free as long as it makes sure its product can use every other application found in the Google Play store. </p>

<p>Phone manufacturers, like Samsung, save time and money by not building their own application platform and application storefront; we get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best Android phone</a> with access to all the apps we love plus a market with over a million others, and Google gets a lot of people using its services and being on the internet to see Google&apos;s ads.</p>
<p>This couldn't happen without Android being free to use, so the time and money Google invests in Android makes it a very lucrative part of its business. By providing Android as source code anyone can use instead of a standalone product like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com">Windows</a>, Google can reap the benefits while another company does the work of building and maintaining a living operating system. AOSP means everyone wins, and that's the way we like it.</p>

Google came out swinging with the Pixel 8 Pro, showing off a device that doesn't need the most performance to still be great. While it's more expensive than others, there are a boatload of features that aim to set the standard for the market.</p></p>
