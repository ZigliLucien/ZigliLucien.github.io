                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've spent the last two months testing the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, and I keep trying to figure out who this tablet is for. It's eerily similar to the older Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, while packing a new Mediatek Dimensity 9300+ chipset that doesn't add much value over the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 platform in its predecessor. Put simply, there's more alike than different between these two 12.4-inch tablets, and I'm absolutely convinced the older one is the better value.</p><p>That was true before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/black-friday-cyber-monday-2024-what-android-central-staff-bought">Cyber Monday deals</a> slashed hundreds off the price of Galaxy Tab hardware, but it's even more true now.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a large and capable Samsung tablet with a Qualcomm processor; you don't have a Galaxy Tab S9 or S10 series tablet; you aren't considering an iPad.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a compact tablet; you'd rather buy the M4 iPad Pro at $850 for Cyber Monday; you'd rather buy the newer Galaxy Tab S10 Plus at $850 for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>So, don't make a mistake this Cyber Monday. Samsung is marketing the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus as an "AI tablet" with plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">great Galaxy AI features</a>, and that's true. However, you get many of the same Galaxy AI features on the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, too. That's the story of these two tablets. There may be small tweaks here and there between models, but you'll get the same experience regardless of which one you choose. If that's the case, why spend more?</p><p>The biggest reason to go with the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus over the newer Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is the processor situation. The brand-new tablet packs the Mediatek Dimensity 9300+, and in benchmarks, it hangs with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor in the Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. Usually, we expect a new tablet to <em>at least</em> offer a spec bump and slight performance jump over its predecessor, and that's part of what makes the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus so odd.</p><p>If you're in the market for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">great Android tablet</a> on Cyber Monday, I'd recommend either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> or Galaxy Tab S9 Plus. Remember, Samsung didn't launch a Galaxy Tab S10 this year, so the Galaxy Tab S9 is still the newest normal-sized tablet in its lineup. The only reason you might want to jump for the newer model is if you need seven years of OS upgrades, which only the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus provides.</p><p>Whichever model you prefer, you can find deals for the Galaxy Tab S9, Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, and Galaxy Tab S10 Plus below. Act fast, because Cyber Monday is quickly coming an end.</p>

For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-x-kim-k-vs-jlab-go-air-tones">before Beat x Kim, there was JLab x Win</a> (aka JLab&apos;s CEO Win Cramer, who donned an outfit similar to Kim&apos;s in jest). Just like the special edition Beats Fit Pro x Kim K, JLab&apos;s Go Air Tones and Go Air Tones+ earbuds come in a wide range of skin tones. Unlike Beats, you don&apos;t need more than $25 to own a pair. And thanks to this Cyber Monday deal, you don&apos;t even need $20 to your name!</p><p>Celebrity feud aside, JLab has always been popular with the masses. The brand makes really affordable audio products, mainly true wireless earbuds and Bluetooth headphones. We have tested many of the brand&apos;s products, including these stylish skin-colored buds as well. For about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYNDXZ12/"><strong>$17 and some change at Amazon</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jlab-Go-Air-Tones-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Bluetooth-35-Hour-Playtime-7572-W/6782951216"><strong>Walmart</strong></a>, these earbuds are smashing!</p>

<p>Follow the trends without going broke with the discounted JLab Go Air Tones+ earbuds. This pair looks good, lasts for up to 35 hours, feels pretty good in-ear, and offers features like Google Fast Pair and touch controls. The case comes with a built-in USB-C cable for quick recharging. It's mad how much you get for less than $20 this Cyber Monday.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYNDXZ12/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="bcc2a06e-4619-4475-aca5-bd89ff5f8754" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="JLab Go Air Tones+: $24.99" data-dimension48="JLab Go Air Tones+: $24.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re an audiophile who wants LDAC support, hi-res audio, wireless charging, a long battery life, and an ergonomic design.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want high-end audio quality and more durable ingress protection.</p><p>If you asked me what was the best pair of wireless earbuds to buy during Cyber Monday, my answer would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare#section-today-s-best-deals">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/my-favorite-wireless-earbuds-of-the-year-are-on-sale-for-black-friday">EarFun Air Pro 4</a>. But if you told me your budget was less than $20, there&apos;s no better option than the JLab Go Air Tones+. Despite being filthy cheap, these wireless buds pack an unbelievable number of premium features that will leave you in awe of the price tag.</p><p>The JLab Go Air Tones+ are comfortable to wear and use, come with extra ear tips in the box, and have a built-in USB Type-C cable inside the case. You can choose from seven neutral tones to match your skin color, just like Kim Kardashian. The buds set up in seconds thanks to Google Fast Pair and Bluetooth 5.1 helps elongate the buds&apos; lifespan to 35 hours or so.</p><p>JLab included an equalizer in the companion app. You get touch controls on the JLab Go Air Tones+ buds and noise cancellation too. There&apos;s even an ambient "Be Aware" mode which is a pleasant surprise in this budget tier. The IPX4 splash-proof rating is terrible, but it&apos;s better than nothing. For the price, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> are awesome!</p>

The speaker is easily portable, has 360-degree sound, and you get chunky buttons at the front that allow you to change the volume and adjust music playback. <br><br>The StormBox 2 debuted earlier this year for $69, and for Cyber Monday, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">speaker is available for $54</a>, making it a good choice if you need a portable Bluetooth speaker with powerful sound. Logitech's UE Boom 4 is the best-seller in this category, and while it has plenty to offer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Waterproof-360-Degree-Crystal-Clear/dp/B0CVFKZ1LC">it costs $99</a>, and you don't get sound quality that's twice as good.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You want a Bluetooth speaker that's easy to carry anywhere and sounds great. The StormBox 2 comes with IPX7 ingress protection, so you can use it at the pool without any issues. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need fast charging.</p>
<p>The only issue I have with the StormBox 4 is that it takes nearly four hours to charge the internal battery. There's no fast charging, so you'll ideally need to plug it in overnight. Thankfully, battery life is pretty great, so you won't need to charge it that regularly. <br><br>Outside of that, this is a terrific Bluetooth speaker. It connects over Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn't see any issues pairing it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>. The sound quality is why I use it over other Bluetooth speakers; it has a fabulous low-end along with clear mids and a good treble, and you can easily customize the sound to your tastes. The 360-degree positioning of the drivers makes a difference, and it projects a louder sound than you'd usually get in a unit this size. <br><br>You can also use it in the shower or the pool, thanks to IPX7 ingress protection. There's a 3.5mm jack as well, and I usually connect the StormBox 2 to my synth (an Arturia MicroFreak) when I'm dabbling with the sounds on the go. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">coming in at $54</a>, you're getting an unbeatable value.</p>

It's been said that Samsung does this to ensure it makes enough off each phone but, apparently, all that goes out the window for Cyber Monday because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzwaxaa/"><strong>Samsung is selling the phone for $800 off</strong></a>. No cap. No activation nonsense. No trade-in required.</p><p>At this price, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the best large foldable you'll find anywhere. Even better than the OnePlus Open, which is the foldable phone we normally recommend because of its design and overall value. Plus, since this deal is direct from Samsung, you get to choose from two colors you can't get anywhere else!</p><p>As we said in our review, the Z Fold 6 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">master of refinements</a> and with One UI 7 coming soon — and another 7 years of software support left for this phone — there's little doubt in my mind that Samsung will do everything it can to take back the foldable crown.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You've been on the fence about buying a foldable phone. Samsung offers the best support for its phones, including seven years of updates, tons of available accessories, and great companion products like the S Pen.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You care more about camera zoom than a folding phone. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is the better buy, in that case.</p><p>I've long been a huge proponent of foldable phones because they're so wonderfully versatile. It might sound silly to have a "folding tablet in your pocket" but don't knock it until you try it. The first time you unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to get a bigger view of whatever you're looking at, you'll never go back to a regular smartphone again.</p><p>And while it's true that the Z Fold 6's cameras don't provide the best zoom detail on the market, it regularly surprises us with its capabilities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">When compared to the OnePlus Open</a> - a foldable phone with superior camera hardware - the Galaxy Z Fold 6 does more than just hold its own.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">Z Fold 6 supports the Samsung S Pen</a>, something no other foldable brand does. Heck, even the Slim S Pen case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Protective-Release-Version-EF-OF95PCJEGUS/dp/B0D1W3N2RB/"><strong>is half off today</strong></a>, making this the ultimate note-taking machine at your fingertips.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a reliable mesh system that can make it easy to expand WiFi across several rooms or areas of a building; you use Google Home and want a WiFi system that's easily integrated with the app; you like a WiFi router that's well-designed and won't throw off your aesthetic.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don't need industry-leading WiFi speeds and would rather get something more affordable; you need something that's completely free of latency spikes.</p><p>The Google Nest Home WiFi Pro is an excellent pick for the needs of most users, especially if you want a mesh system that will cover your whole house without sacrificing high-speed connectivity. These mesh WiFi routers boast WiFi 6E technology and include 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and two separate 6 GHz bands for optimal speeds. According to Google, these will cover up to 6,600 square feet with high-speed WiFi, which is more than enough for most use cases.</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/blanket-your-house-with-wi-fi-and-your-wallet-with-savings-with-a-prime-day-deal-on-google-nest-wifi-pro">deals on the Google Nest WiFi Pro set</a> aren't uncommon, this is the lowest the price has ever been—and it's only ever been this cheap a couple of other times.</p><p>It's a perfect pick for anyone who is already enmeshed (pun intended) in the Google Home ecosystem, or for anyone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-nest-matter-rollout-android-fast-pair">smart home devices from Matter</a>, as the company added Nest support for the brand's products a couple of years ago.</p><p>Regarding the downsides of this mesh router setup, these are not compatible with older Google WiFi or Nest WiFi products, even after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/older-nest-cameras-are-getting-the-google-home-app-treatment">older Nest cameras started being integrated into the Google Home app</a> just this month. Users have also reported some moments of high latency spikes, which could be a dealbreaker for some, though the majority of folks haven't noticed such an issue on the regular.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a phone grip with MagSafe support for really cheap.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want something very rugged.</p><p>I&apos;ve gone over this before, but I&apos;ll say it again. MagSafe accessories are awesome. I think every possible phone accessory should have this feature. Most phone grips attach adhesively, which means you need to stick strong 3M glue on the back of your beloved phone case. And if you need to charge wirelessly after that, the phone case needs to come off. Same thing if you need to use a phone holder or phone stand.</p><p>A MagSafe phone grip is such an elegant solution to this sticky problem. No more mucking around with glue, you just add a magnetic ring sticker to the back of your case if your phone doesn&apos;t come with MagSafe or Qi2 support. The sticker is barely noticeable. On the contrary, it might even liven up your phone cover and make it look cooler if you like that look.</p><p>With a MagSafe grip like the PopSockets Phone Grip, you can attach the grip whenever it&apos;s needed, for as long as you like. Once you&apos;re done, you just pop it off the back and put it away without any mess. Plus, the MagSafe sticker lets non-MagSafe phones use other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a> such as car chargers and power banks. It&apos;s a win-win-win situation!</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're looking to replace that uncomfortable cloth head strap with something far better and <em>also</em> want to add hours of additional battery life to the Quest 3 or Quest 3S.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't like the fit of Elite Straps. Some people prefer the halo-style head strap design. If that's you, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/">give the Kiwi Design H4 a shot</a>, instead.</p><p>The cloth strap that comes with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S isn't great. It doesn't help balance the headset's weight very much and it is more difficult to adjust than I'd like. This Yoges Elite Strap is <em>super</em> simple to adjust thanks to the handy wheel on the back that tightens or loosens the strap without any fuss.</p>

<p>Supple padding all around the head strap ensure that it feels cushy on your head — not heavy — and the strap design ensures it stays in place even during the most high-action games. No wobble! That padding is also really easy to spray and wipe down, unlike the default cloth strap that absorbs sweat (YUCK).</p><p>Not only that, but the battery that magnetically attaches on the back helps add a nice counterweight that further balances the headset. Installation is super easy as you'll just pop the old one off and click the new one onto the arms on each side of the Meta Quest. Plug in the battery cable that's preinstalled on the strap and you're ready to play and charge as you please.</p><p>My son and I both swear by this one as the best Elite Strap on the market, and this deal makes it impossible to pass up!</p>

All you need to do is connect your phone, and you have a home theater on the go. There are a few brands that are catering to this niche, and TCL-backed RayNeo is a frontrunner on the back of products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/rayneo-air-2s-xr-smart-glasses-review">Air 2S</a>. <br><br>The Air 2S XR glasses have Sony micro-OLED that projects up to a 200-degree image, and it has 120Hz refresh, which actually makes a difference. But what I like the most about it is that it has a bright image, so even if you're outdoors, there are no issues in this area. The Air 2S usually costs $379, but it's now on sale for Cyber Monday, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-dp-B0D93R1RT3/dp/B0D93R1RT3">cost down to $279</a>.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need XR glasses that are well-suited for entertainment. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want XR glasses that don't have any fringing on the edges.</p>
<p>I also have the regular Air 2 glasses, and the main difference between those and the Air 2S is that the latter is lighter, and you get much better sound. You get quad audio drivers on the unit, and the sound quality is noticeably better. Otherwise, you get the same Sony micro-OLED panel on both glasses, and it has great color fidelity and brightness. <br><br>While they're aimed at streaming, I mostly use these glasses in conjunction with the Steam Deck; it's just great to be able to enlarge the screen of the handheld while sitting on the sofa and gaming, and the Air 2S is terrific in this area. I didn't have any issues with the fit either, and the only issue I noticed with these glasses is that there's fringing at the edges. It's not as evident as the Air 2, but it's still there, and you see it when moving your head around. <br><br>You also get a hard shell case, and it's essential to ensure these glasses stay protected on the go. Overall, the Air 2S glasses offer a unique way to stream entertainment on the go, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-2s-Glasses-Brightness-dp-B0D93R1RT3/dp/B0D93R1RT3">Cyber Monday deal</a> makes the product that much more affordable.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Waze incident alerts, like police presence warnings, are showing up on Google Maps, with a clear note that they came from Waze users.</li><li>Users can confirm or dismiss these alerts, which pop up briefly to keep the map clean.</li><li>The feature is still rolling out slowly, with only a few users noticing it, and its regional availability is unclear.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over ten years after buying Waze, Google has finally been blending the platform with its own navigation app, with the latest step being the addition of live Waze incident reports to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a>.</p><p>Back in July, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-making-your-commute-less-sucky-with-new-traffic-and-parking-helpers">revealed plans to simplify incident reporting</a> by merging insights from both Maps and Waze users. Around the same time, Waze announced plans to share its user reports directly with Maps. Now, with Waze incident reports officially live on Maps, that vision is becoming a reality.</p><p>A post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1h38vj1/google_maps_now_sharing_waze_user_reports/" target="_blank">Maps subreddit</a> recently highlighted Waze-sourced incident alerts, like heads-ups about nearby police presence, popping up on Maps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/30/google-maps-waze-reports/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The alert also makes it clear that the report came from a Waze user.</p><p>The alert lets users confirm if law enforcement is still at the spot. You can say yes, no, or just dismiss it altogether.</p><p>The alert pops up briefly before disappearing, keeping the map clear for navigation. It’s still pretty under the radar since most Maps users haven’t seen it yet.</p><p>The update comes shortly after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-easier-to-report-police-spottings-in-maps">revamped Maps' incident reporting</a>, changing "speed traps" to the broader "police," so it now covers all sorts of law enforcement activity on the roads.</p><p>Right now, the feature seems to be rolling out slowly, with just a few users—like the original Reddit poster and a commenter—spotting it. Its regional availability is still unclear too.</p><p>As 9to5Google puts it, bringing Google’s navigation apps together was a no-brainer. Sure, the incident reports might not always be spot-on, but those quick confirmation buttons make it easy for the community to keep things updated in real time.</p><p>Even though Google owns both, Maps and Waze have been running as separate apps. With both still thriving under Google after a decade, a full integration isn’t in the cards. But the recent addition of Waze incident reports to Maps shows there's more overlap happening between the two.</p>

That's where I come in — I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-tested-over-70-phones-in-2024-these-are-my-black-friday-picks">used over 70 phones</a> this year, and I have a good understanding of what each manufacturer is bringing to the table. I'm fortunate in that I don't need to buy phones (the last device I bought was the LG G4), but I routinely suggest phones to friends and family, and I'm cognizant of how much these devices cost now. <br><br>I analyzed all the phone deals available on Cyber Monday, and if I had to buy one with my own money, there's no doubt that I'd choose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. It isn't a recent phone, and the Tensor G4 platform powering the device isn't the fastest around, but as an overall device, the Pixel 8 Pro ticks all the right boxes — it has fantastic cameras at the back, clean software with no bloatware and useful AI features, a vibrant OLED panel, and battery that lasts all day. <br><br>But the biggest reason for recommending the phone is the sheer value; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9"><strong>the Pixel 8 Pro is now selling for just $592 as part of Google's Cyber Monday deals</strong></a>, and that's an unbelievable 41% discount from its usual selling price. Although there are better phones on sale, there isn't another device that gives you as many features as the Pixel 8 Pro in the sub-$600 category.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a phone with clean software, great cameras, and long-term software updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You play demanding games regularly on your phone.</p>
<p>I don't have much to fault with the Pixel 8 Pro; if anything, I like the design more than that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. It does a great job at the basics, and the cameras are outstanding at both photos and videos. It may not be quite on par with the Vivo X100 Pro or X100 Ultra, but there's no question that it measures up to any phone sold in North America. <br><br>The only annoyance is that it still has 128GB of storage on the base model, so you'll ideally need to invest in an external SSD to back up photos and videos once the storage gets full. What's interesting is that it will also get seven years of software updates, so it will continue to be relevant until 2030 — I can't say the same for any other phone in this category. <br><br>Ultimately, it's the clean software and great cameras that make me excited to use the Pixel 8 Pro, and the fact that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">now down to $592</a> makes this the best Cyber Monday phone deal.</p>
