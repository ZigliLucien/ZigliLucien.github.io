                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android users aren&apos;t typically too envious of the iPhone experience, but I think it&apos;s safe to say that MagSafe is a notable exception. Since Apple introduced the magnetic connection and wireless charging standard with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-iphone-12-review">iPhone 12</a> series, MagSafe has grown into what is easily the largest accessory ecosystem on the planet. It gets everything right, from simplicity to functionality to compatibility. An accessory you bought for the long-retired iPhone 12 mini will work with the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with no problem. </p><p>Luckily, the MagSafe experience is imminent on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and that&apos;s thanks to the Qi2 standard. We don&apos;t know which mainstream phone will be the first to launch with Qi2, but it&apos;ll likely come sometime this year. Many were disappointed that Samsung didn&apos;t include Qi2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> that launched in January. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to wait, the Peak Design ecosystem brings the MagSafe experience to Android phones today. As a longtime MagSafe user, I spent a few weeks using magnetic accessories provided by Peak Design on my iPhones and Android smartphones. With as little as one Peak Design phone case, your phone can tap into the expansive MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. If this is what the future of Qi2 on Android holds, I&apos;m excited about it. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Charger-Comparison.jpg" alt="An iPhone and an Android phone using MagSafe chargers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Late in 2023, the Wireless Power Consortium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/resources/qi2-the-new-qi2-standard-for-wireless-devices/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Qi2 standard was ready to be included on new devices. There are a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">benefits to the Qi2</a> standard, like 15W wireless charging as opposed to 5W speeds using regular Qi. And since devices must be certified by the WPC in order to use the Qi2 name and branding, you&apos;ll be certain that chargers and accessories will work with your phone. </p><p>However, the bigger part of Qi2 has little to do with charging. The standard includes support for the Magnetic Power Profile, and this is partially derived from Apple&apos;s own MagSafe tech. Qi2 includes a ring of magnets that&apos;ll help your phone align perfectly with a wireless charger&apos;s coils, which increases charging efficiency. More importantly, the Qi2 standard&apos;s magnet ring is interoperable with MagSafe. A future is shaping up where you&apos;ll be able to buy Qi2 or MagSafe accessories and use them with basically any new phone you can find.</p>
<h2 id="the-peak-design-ecosystem-is-a-solution-for-today-2">The Peak Design ecosystem is a solution for today</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL" name="Peak-Design-SlimLink.jpg" alt="The SlimLink connector on a Peak Design Everyday Case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a surprising number of ways to get MagSafe to work with your Android phone in 2024. Some cases include built-in MagSafe rings, or you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">slap a MagSafe ring sticker on any phone</a> or case of your choosing. To me, using a Peak Design Everyday Case is one of the better options. There are Everyday Case options for all the biggest Android phone models, and they have more features than just MagSafe compatibility. In fact, Peak Design includes its own SlimLink connection standard as an alternative to MagSafe on the Everyday Case. </p><p>What separates Peak Design&apos;s ecosystem from all the other ways of getting MagSafe on Android is that it feels official. Things like magnetic sticker rings and cheap MagSafe phone cases often feel like hacky solutions rather than polished ones. By comparison, it&apos;s impossible to see that the Everyday Case supports MagSafe just by looking at it. Aside from the SlimLink mounting point, the Everyday Case looks just like any other premium case with a canvas exterior and plastic frame. </p><p>Completing the experience is a wide variety of first-party accessories that compare with Apple&apos;s own official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a>. For example, the Peak Design Mobile Wallet is like an Apple MagSafe Wallet, but better. I&apos;m on my third leather MagSafe Wallet from Apple, and I have had two replaced under warranty because they literally fell apart. So far, the Mobile Wallet seems better than the MagSafe Wallet in a number of ways. It also matches the Everyday Case in the same way that a leather MagSafe wallet matches Apple&apos;s official leather iPhone case.</p>

<p>However, the best part of using the Peak Design Everyday Case is that you can use it with non-Peak Design accessories. I&apos;ve used my Mobile Wallet with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, which I use without a case. I&apos;ve also used an official Apple MagSafe charger with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> through an Everyday Case. With these accessories, you can use the same great products with iPhones <em>and</em> Android phones. Considering that accessory makers consistently put more effort into creating products for iPhones, interoperability is a huge win for Android users.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-only-going-to-get-better-with-qi2-2">It&apos;s only going to get better with Qi2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqi87xv4WLkZZMFtX2wEpY" name="Peak-Design-Wall-Mount-Pixel.jpg" alt="The Peak Design wall mount." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqi87xv4WLkZZMFtX2wEpY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By simply putting a Peak Design case on my Android phone, I&apos;ve been able to replicate the MagSafe experience. However, even a case won&apos;t be required for this kind of functionality in the not-so-distant future. When Android phones start shipping with Qi2, the accessory market will gain some much-needed parity between the iPhone and Android markets. If my time using Peak Design accessories is any indication, the future of smartphones with Qi2 looks bright. </p>

<ul><li>Google published a research paper about a new generative AI model for weather forecasting called Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS). </li><li>Weather forecasting can be expensive, especially when highly trained AI models and supercomputers are involved, and that's where SEEDS comes into play.</li><li>Right now, Google's weather-forecasting AI models are comparable in accuracy to other methods, but they are much more efficient and cost-effective.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even with detailed weather information in the palm of our hands, thanks to our smartphones, the weather consistently surprises us. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-weather-ui-redesign-phone-rollout">Weather</a> forecasting won&apos;t ever be perfect, but there may be room for it to improve, thanks to emerging technology. Using fancy artificial intelligence models and supercomputers seems like an obvious solution, but those options come with high costs. However, Google thinks it can make medium-range weather forecasting more efficient with generative artificial intelligence. </p><p>Google recently published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489" target="_blank">report</a> and subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on SEEDS, an AI model that stands for Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-seeds-weather-forecast-ai-prediction/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The company cites the problem with current methods for weather forecasting, such as physics-based simulation. While accurate, physics-based simulation becomes incredibly expensive at a large scale. </p><p>By comparison, Google says that SEEDS can "efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts <em>at scale </em>at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing SEEDS, our newest generative AI technology that advances medium-range weather forecasting. We can now generate ensemble forecasts more efficiently, helping us better predict rare and extreme weather events. 🌩️ #WeatherForecasting Learn more at https://t.co/wcVXjpS1dx pic.twitter.com/iLOEWVZelS<a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1773774362413355099">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As they currently stand, AI models are not more accurate than other weather forecasting methods, but they are comparable. In the future, models like SEEDS could grow to be more accurate than physics-based models. However, a more realistic future could see a mix of physics-based models and generative AI models used to balance accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. </p><p>"SEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace," Google says. "The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version."</p><p>Google thinks that the increased efficiency of generative AI could allow weather reporting institutions to invest in forecasting in different ways. If a model like SEEDS could take a few physics-based models and turn them into a multitude of weather distributions, the money and resources saved from using fewer traditional simulations could fund a greater number of forecasts released more often. Alternatively, Google says the extra resources could be used to create more detailed physics-based models. </p><p>The SEEDS model joins MetNet-3 and GraphCast as Google&apos;s newest weather-related technologies. Whether or not SEEDS ever powers a consumer-grade product, it&apos;s cool to see use cases for AI outside of chatbots and image generators.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy phones released in 2020 received their last monthly update with the March 2024 security patch. </li><li>From now on, the Galaxy S20 series will get quarterly software updates until support is completely dropped. </li><li>The specific smartphone models affected are the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung made waves when it decided to extend software support for a handful of older devices a few years ago and more recently when it promised seven years of support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. However, through all of this, the Galaxy S20 series has been left out. The company&apos;s smartphones released in 2020 did not get the operating system upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and now, its run of monthly software updates has ended. </p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-quarterly-updates-3430310/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first reported, the Galaxy S20 series is no longer eligible for monthly updates and will receive them on a quarterly basis instead. Owners of the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra — all released in 2020 — should now expect updates four times a year, usually every three months. Following a lack of support for Android 14, the switch to quarterly updates is the latest step toward obsolescence for the four-year-old smartphone lineup. </p><p>While it might be disappointing to lose support for monthly security updates, this was somewhat expected. Samsung promised three years of OS upgrades for the Galaxy S20 series, which originally shipped with Android 10. After getting the bump to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> in 2022, Samsung&apos;s original promise was met. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJghtKahdF46jXTqP7Wp8k" name="ringtone-picker-samsung-galaxy-s20-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Ringtones picker on the Samsung Galaxy S20 kept on a red couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJghtKahdF46jXTqP7Wp8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That means the last monthly update to reach Galaxy S20 smartphones is the March 2024 update. All the fixes in the April 2024 update won&apos;t hit this lineup of phones until the next quarterly update, which is slated for June 2024. Interestingly, the Galaxy 20 series will be supported for a total of five years with security updates — albeit less frequently — which exceeds Samsung&apos;s original promise.</p><p>Although the Samsung Galaxy S20 series won&apos;t have access to the April 2024 security update, it has already started reaching other devices. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements" target="_blank">started seeing the April 2024 patch</a> last week, and it included more than just bug fixes. Aside from those improvements, the April 2024 update featured support for 480p resolution with Instant Slow-Mo videos.</p><p>Fortunately, users who upgrade to the Galaxy S24 series can take advantage of seven years of software support, and that&apos;ll probably outlast the phone&apos;s hardware.</p>

So when Xiaomi announced that it was ready to roll out the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, I was immediately excited.</p><p>That said, I had my misgivings; 2024 has been a terrific year for phone cameras, with the Honor Magic 6 Pro and Find X7 Ultra setting a very high standard. I wasn&apos;t sure how Xiaomi would match these devices — much less beat them — but then I started using the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and it was a revelation.</p><p>You need to use the Xiaomi 14 Ultra for just a few minutes to realize that it is magnificent. I used a lot of phones this year, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the one that stands out the most. It just has that little bit extra that turns a great phone into something truly special.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Xiaomi 14 Ultra at Mobile World Congress 2024, and the device made its global debut shortly at a launch event in India on March 7. It went on general availability starting March 14, and it is now available in the U.K. and other global markets.</p><p>Xiaomi is selling a single version of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra globally, and it comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The phone costs £1,299 ($1,640) in the U.K., and all orders include the Xiaomi Pad 6 as well as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Professional Kit — a £300 value. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra costs €1,499 ($1,620) in Germany and other parts of the region, and while all orders come with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Professional Kit as standard, buyers outside the U.K. don&apos;t get the Xiaomi Pad 6.</p><p>Xiaomi is doing things differently in India, where the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is available for ₹99,999 ($1,199). That&apos;s considerably lower than what the device retails for in most regions, and you get the same 16GB/512GB version. Xiaomi India isn&apos;t bundling anything with the device, but the fact that it&apos;s so affordable makes it a much better choice than in any other region.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi 13 Ultra</a> got a lot right last year, but the camera island was massive, and it sat on a raised platform that made using the phone without a case annoying. While Xiaomi retained the same broad design, it made several tweaks that make holding and using the Xiaomi 14 Ultra that much easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7FCBiwXaGcNgLRJAciPgM9" name="xiaomi14-ultra-6.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FCBiwXaGcNgLRJAciPgM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has no design similarities to the rest of its siblings; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> has an entirely different aesthetic, and it isn&apos;t evident that both phones are in the same series. Having said that, I think the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is one of the best-looking phones Xiaomi released in recent years, and the white variant in particular is stunning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h3XhsC2mBgZYPBrvZcHURB" name="xiaomi14-ultra-8.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3XhsC2mBgZYPBrvZcHURB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You still get a leather back, and it now covers the entire width of the phone. Just like last year, the mid-frame extends to the back where it merges seamlessly with the leather, and it looks rather cool. Xiaomi uses an aluminum mid-frame in global models of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and I was keen on using the titanium version of the device to see how it would hold up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but it is limited to China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NpDAQiwPnhC6EBD7EUnUHC" name="xiaomi14-ultra-28.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpDAQiwPnhC6EBD7EUnUHC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera housing at the back is nearly unchanged to last year, and the only difference is that it is even larger. You still get a gold accent that encircles the housing, and the sheer size makes it stand out visually. Having used the Xiaomi 13 Ultra extensively, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has a much better in-hand feel; the device is a smidgen shorter and wider than its predecessor, and that is noticeable when using both phones next to each other.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qh3FvJHzw66bWXppVPuZ9B" name="xiaomi14-ultra-26.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qh3FvJHzw66bWXppVPuZ9B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are on the right, and the fingerprint sensor is optimally located on the screen where it can be easily accessed by your thumb when using the phone one-handed. A lot of manufacturers position the module lower on the screen, but that thankfully isn&apos;t an issue on this phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5BHpmPQeiRwWWsaMVxJAn8" name="xiaomi14-ultra-11.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BHpmPQeiRwWWsaMVxJAn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about non-issues, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, giving it the same level of resilience as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> — it&apos;s good to see Xiaomi continuing to offer this feature as standard on its high-end devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YuSyfgGwkSG36gZbzTvq9A" name="xiaomi14-ultra-1.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuSyfgGwkSG36gZbzTvq9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra has the same 6.73-inch AMOLED panel as last year, and it retains Dolby Vision and HDR10+. The only meaningful difference in this area is that the screen goes up to 3,000 nits in HDR content, and while it tends to get marginally brighter than its predecessor in daily use, it isn&apos;t noticeable unless you&apos;re using both devices side-by-side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NpWehtqDz5ksCUSxNPnGSD" name="xiaomi14-ultra-15.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpWehtqDz5ksCUSxNPnGSD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there isn&apos;t much of the way of an upgrade, the screen has plenty going for it; the LTPO tech ensures the dynamic refresh goes down to 1Hz when viewing static content, you get a great selection of always-on styles, and there&apos;s a lot of customizability in general. You can adjust the color balance, change color gamut, and tweak just about everything to do with the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RSwvWnn3K7VzcgoCwVLdoF" name="xiaomi14-ultra-22.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSwvWnn3K7VzcgoCwVLdoF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi does a great job with color calibration in general, and while the Xiaomi 14 Ultra doesn&apos;t quite hit the insane brightness levels posted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, the AMOLED panel has standout colors and contrast levels, and is outstanding in daily use. I didn&apos;t see any issues while streaming content or playing games on the device, and the stereo sound is among the best phone of any phone I tested in 2024.</p>

<p>The one area where things are different is screen protection; Xiaomi is using its own in-house glass layer in lieu of Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass, with the brand noting that it offers much better shatter resistance. I put that to the test (unwittingly, as always) when the device slid down the nightstand and fell to the floor, and thankfully there was no damage.</p>

<p>Like its rivals, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it has all the additional features you&apos;d want in a high-end device. Xiaomi is making a single variant of the phone available in global markets, and it comes with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. I would have liked to see the 1TB model making its global debut, but like other Chinese brands, Xiaomi is limiting that variant to its home market.</p><p>The phone has no slowdowns or lag whatsoever in daily use, and while Xiaomi didn&apos;t introduce many new software features, it made system stability a priority.</p>

<p>Xiaomi intentionally blocks access to 3DMark on its devices, but surprisingly enough, that isn&apos;t the case on the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — I was able to launch the utility and run the usual tests. It&apos;s clear that Xiaomi set conservative thermal limits on the device, as it didn&apos;t get close to the likes of the Zenfone 11 and Magic 6 Pro in a lot of synthetic workloads.</p>
<p>Also, while running the 3DMark Solar Bay stress test, the device got so hot that it effectively shut down. A large Device Overheated message showed up on the screen, and it shut down the radios and went into hibernation. I didn&apos;t run into this particular issue on any device in several years — Sony&apos;s phones were prone to hit their thermal limit often — but it&apos;s no wonder that Xiaomi is being aggressive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ErLaKfoq62qv89W7K9ewjD" name="xiaomi14-ultra-24.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErLaKfoq62qv89W7K9ewjD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the device doesn&apos;t overheat in regular use, and while it tends to get hot after extended gaming sessions, it isn&apos;t uncomfortable to hold.</p>
<p>Xiaomi is known to deliver a good hardware package, and it didn&apos;t leave anything out here; the Xiaomi 14 Ultra includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, global Sub-6 5G bands, NFC, the entire suite of AptX audio codecs, and USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort, allowing you to mirror the device to an external monitor.</p><p>The vibration motor is fantastic as well, delivering exquisite feedback when using the keyboard and navigating the interface. I didn&apos;t see any issues with connectivity or the rest of the radios, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is one of the most feature-rich phones you can get today.</p>

<p>Xiaomi isn&apos;t changing anything around the battery, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has the same 5,000mAh battery as its predecessor. You get the same 90W charging tech as well, and it takes just over 35 minutes to charge the battery. What I like about Xiaomi&apos;s charging tech is that it uses the USB PD 3.0 standard, and the bundled 90W charger is great at charging a whole host of other devices in addition to the phone.</p><p>Xiaomi also offers wireless charging on the device, and it goes up to 80W. That said, the brand doesn&apos;t sell its wireless charger in most countries, and it goes down to 15W when using a regular Qi charging mat.</p><p>Thanks to the large battery, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra manages to last well over a day without any issues whatsoever. It lasts a little longer than its predecessor, and even with heavy use, it delivers over a day&apos;s worth of power consistently. To be honest, battery anxiety really isn&apos;t a thing in 2024, and with most high-end phones offering 5000mAh or larger batteries, you&apos;re guaranteed to get a day&apos;s worth of use without any hassle.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="potncUtAozcxRPiVDU4MC8" name="xiaomi14-ultra-4.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/potncUtAozcxRPiVDU4MC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 13 Ultra had the best cameras of any phone I tested in 2023, so I was keen on taking a look at what the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has to offer in this area. Thankfully, Xiaomi hasn&apos;t made too many changes in this area — the phone has quad 50MP cameras this time as well — and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra retains a lot of the same great features that made its predecessor stand out.</p><p>The main camera is a 1-inch 50MP Sony LYT-900 module, and the key talking point is that it uses variable aperture, going from f/1.6 all the way to f/4.0. There&apos;s limited adjustability in auto mode, but the Pro mode unlocks the full potential of the module. You get a 50MP wide-angle lens that uses a Sony IMX858 module, and two 50MP telephoto lenses, one that goes up to 3.2x optical zoom and the other up to 5x.</p><p>Xiaomi isn&apos;t the only manufacturer offering two telephoto modules, with the Find X7 Ultra also going this route. There&apos;s OIS on three of the lenses (the wide-angle misses out), and at the front Xiaomi offers a 32MP camera — identical to last year.</p><p>The Leica partnership brings a slate of shooting modes and effects, and you&apos;ll need to pick between Leica Vibrant and Leica Authentic modes for stills — I prefer to use the Vibrant mode as it delivers better colors. There are more shooting modes than you&apos;ll end up using, and Xiaomi didn&apos;t leave anything out. </p>

<p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra takes fantastic photos in daylight conditions, delivering excellent dynamic range, color vibrancy, and rendition. I don&apos;t have anything to fault with the camera in daylight scenarios, and the wide-angle lens does a good job serving up a similar caliber of shots as the main lens.</p><p>Where the phone truly comes into its own is portrait shots; I got better images out of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra than my mirrorless, and this is the biggest reason why I use the device. It also does a great job with moving subjects; we have a nine-month-old who doesn&apos;t sit still for more than a few seconds, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is able to keep up with her.</p><p>I haven&apos;t used the telephoto lenses all that much, but they are better than last year — even though Xiaomi is using the same camera modules. Tweaks to its camera tuning means you get better detail at 3.2x and 5x, and what&apos;s evident this year is how good the shots are at up to 10x and even beyond.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra excels in low-light scenarios, and even with little to no ambient light, the phone somehow manages to deliver usable shots. I&apos;ve always maintained that Google makes the best cameras, but that hasn&apos;t been the case for over a year now, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra extends Xiaomi&apos;s lead in this area.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is leagues ahead of the Galaxy S24 Ultra and even edges out the Honor Magic 6 Pro in most scenarios. I think its biggest rival is the Find X7 Ultra, but with that phone limited to China, Xiaomi doesn&apos;t really have a contender that delivers the same caliber of photos and videos. If you take a lot of photos and videos, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is the best phone of 2024.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-14-ultra-software"><span>Xiaomi 14 Ultra: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G9uWuayDTVJvEXaQv3TxGH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-17.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G9uWuayDTVJvEXaQv3TxGH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi made a big deal of its software overhaul, and at the outset, there isn&apos;t anything noticeably different. HyperOS 1.0 is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and in a lot of ways, it is virtually indistinguishable to MIUI 14. In fact, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra doesn&apos;t have any meaningful new additions on the software side of things.</p>
<p>While the software may not have any groundbreaking features, it is fluid like no other Xiaomi phone. This is true with the standard Xiaomi 14 as well, and the brand deserves credit for finally optimizing its software so that it runs fluidly on Qualcomm&apos;s high-end hardware. The difference is noticeable against the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rr2G9BixYm9oRYFtDhgMPE" name="xiaomi14-ultra-18.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rr2G9BixYm9oRYFtDhgMPE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there are a few frustrations — as is always the case with Xiaomi. The brand has offered a Control Center-style split notification pane for over three years now, but it was always optional; that isn&apos;t the case now. There is no way to get a unified notification pane with toggles and notifications in the same window, and that&apos;s irksome.</p>
<p>But what particularly bothers me is that the toggles section doesn&apos;t have any text labels. This makes it highly annoying to use, and it always took a lot longer to pull up a setting — whether it&apos;s launching Tailscale, accessing Bitwarden, or just toggling the flashlight — than on any other phone. I don&apos;t know what Xiaomi was trying to achieve here, but if the goal was to make the notification pane harder to use, it succeeded.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oHeu2QTnqAJV4emHKkVwpE" name="xiaomi14-ultra-23.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oHeu2QTnqAJV4emHKkVwpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the notification section, a pull-down on a notification doesn&apos;t reveal additional details — you&apos;ll need to use the arrow down button that&apos;s located to the right. This is different to how Google, Samsung, and ASUS do things, and I don&apos;t understand why Xiaomi couldn&apos;t have retained the same system as MIUI 14.</p>
<p>But that&apos;s my only quibble with the software. I still think that Xiaomi&apos;s software is in need of a visual overhaul; ColorOS does a better job integrating Material You with a unique visual aesthetic. The only customization feature that&apos;s new is the ability to change the look of the lock screen, and it is nearly identical to what you get in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a>. </p><p>When it comes to software updates, Xiaomi guarantees four platform updates along with five years of security updates. That&apos;s in line with what other Chinese brands offer, but I&apos;m not convinced that Xiaomi can deliver software updates on time. That may change in the coming months, but until now, Xiaomi was the last of the major Chinese manufacturers to deliver platform updates to its phones.</p>

<p>Honor&apos;s Magic 6 Pro comes close to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra when it comes to the cameras, and the phone is available globally. The phone has a brighter screen and lasts longer, and while its zoom lens isn&apos;t as versatile as the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the main camera and wide-angle lenses take amazing shots in just about any scenario. And at £1,099, it is £200 less than what the Xiaomi 14 Ultra costs in the U.K.</p><p>I like the Find X7 Ultra quite a bit as well, and if anything, it takes slightly better portrait shots than the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — no small feat. But the device is limited to China, and there are so many issues with the software that I&apos;m not going to recommend it.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra inevitably gets a mention because it is the default choice in most countries, but Samsung has played it too safe this year — to the detriment of the device. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has all the extras you need, and the phone feels great to hold and use. While the camera modules haven&apos;t changed, Samsung made plenty of tweaks to its algorithms to deliver better photos, but the phone doesn&apos;t measure up to the Xiaomi 14 Ultra in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p>Xiaomi got a lot right with its phone strategy in 2024. The Xiaomi 14 is a fantastic device that combines high-end internals and standout cameras in a chassis that&apos;s smaller than its rivals, and I liked using the device so much that I didn&apos;t switch out well past the review window.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra is in a league of its own. I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say that this is my favorite phone of 2024; I got close to 30 devices this year — including all the flagships — and it has a better in-hand feel than just about any other phone. But that&apos;s not why I like the phone so much — it&apos;s the cameras that truly differentiate the Xiaomi 14 Ultra from the rest of the pack.</p><p>The Find X7 Ultra and Magic 6 Pro come close to what Xiaomi is offering this year, but the Xiaomi 14 Ultra still has a slender edge when it comes to photos, and it handily beats the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro. It&apos;s great to see Xiaomi bringing the device to additional markets this year, and its launch in India is a pivotal moment as the brand tries to change the status quo.</p><p>Xiaomi has been making flagships for the better part of a decade now, and the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is proof that the Chinese manufacturer can outshine the best that this segment has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Users can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, aligning with OpenAI's goal of broad accessibility for AI tools.</li><li>Not needing an account allows OpenAI to gather more training data, potentially improving AI models.</li><li>While ChatGPT is available without an account, signing up is required for access to paid services and features like DALL-E.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;ve been hesitant about sharing personal information to chat with ChatGPT, OpenAI is now removing that hurdle for you.</p><p>OpenAI&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">free AI platform, ChatGPT,</a> won&apos;t require you to sign up anymore, the company said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/start-using-chatgpt-instantly" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The goal is to make AI tools like ChatGPT accessible to everyone, so now you can jump right in without the hassle of creating an account.</p><p>If you&apos;re cool with it, not needing an account means OpenAI gets more training data. It might also encourage more people to sign up and subscribe for even better access to GPT-4 instead of sticking with the older GPT-3.5 model that free users usually get.</p><p>"We may use what you provide to ChatGPT to improve our models for everyone," OpenAI said.</p><p>But if you&apos;re wary about the whole model training thing, you can still opt out, even without an account. Just click on the little question mark on the right side of the text box, then hit <em>Settings</em>, and flip the switch for "Improve the model for everyone" to off.</p><p>Since ChatGPT debuted back in late 2022, people who wanted to dive in had to make an OpenAI account. Then, OpenAI started offering paid subscriptions to unlock more powerful services like DALL-E 3.</p><p>While OpenAI is letting anyone use its AI chatbot without needing an account, you&apos;ll still need to sign up if you&apos;re eyeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/companies-charging-consumers-ai-subscriptions">paid services like DALL-E</a>. Opting for the GPT-4 subscription redirects you to the service&apos;s signup page.</p><p>To save and review chat history, share chats, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-with-voice-free-users-rollout">have voice conversations</a>, you&apos;ll also need to have an account.</p><p>OpenAI said it&apos;s beefed up protections for users without accounts, like restricting prompts and image generations in certain categories. However, the company hasn&apos;t explained what these categories are.</p><p>If you&apos;re intrigued by ChatGPT, this could be a neat way to test it out without handing over too much of your information.</p>

<p>This year, Motorola finally began to simplify its confusing Moto G lineup of phones. The Moto G 5G ($199) and Moto G Power ($299) sit between the Moto G Play ($149) and the Moto G Stylus ($399) and offer compelling budget-friendly options for buyers looking for a new smartphone in 2024.</p><p>But is it really worth spending an extra $100 on the Moto G Power 2024, or should you save the cash and buy a Moto G 5G 2024 instead? Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024 review</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a> go in-depth for each option, but we&apos;re going to take a high-level look at what&apos;s different between the two and why you might want to consider one over the other.</p>

<p>Both the Moto G 5G 2024 and Moto G Power 5G 2024 feature vegan leather exteriors, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">I praised Motorola for</a> when the phones debuted. Vegan leather feels so much better than a flat plastic back, as it&apos;s made of a durable polyurethane resin that&apos;s fabricated to look and feel similar to animal leather.</p><p>Neither phone scratches very easily and I wasn&apos;t able to make any obvious marks with my fingernail or a car key, so this is actually quite durable. Plus, both phones are water-repellant, which means neither are suitable for taking a bath with but will do just fine in a rain storm.</p>

<p>Motorola offers a rather attractive Pale Lilac colorway for the Moto G Power 5G 2024, while the Moto G 5G 2024 only comes in "Sage Green." I use quotes there because I was actually surprised to see this referred to as Sage Green. In reality, it looks more like a navy blue to me. It&apos;s not a bad color, but it&apos;s certainly not as fun as Pale Lilac.</p><p>Beyond that, both phones feature a plastic frame and buttons, plus some noticeable bezels up front. From the pictures below, you&apos;d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the two.</p>

<p>The real difference comes when using the two phones side-by-side, as you&apos;ll immediately notice how crisper and sharper the Moto G Power 5G&apos;s display is. That&apos;s because it has 1,431,360 more pixels than the Moto G 5G&apos;s display has — that&apos;s more than 2x the pixel density! If you&apos;re someone who plans to watch HD videos on their phone, the Moto G Power 5G&apos;s display will look a lot better.</p><p>On the bright side, if you opt for the less expensive Moto G 5G 2024, you&apos;ll still be getting a smooth 120Hz display that looks good.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that neither phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, which is a good thing for anyone sensitive to light flicker and makes both of these phones preferable over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> at the same price.</p>

<p>Because the display is so much more pixel-dense, Motorola had to put a more powerful processor inside the Moto G Power 5G 2024 compared to the Moto G 5G 2024. Surprisingly, though, it&apos;s only about 10% faster in benchmark applications.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither phone runs games particularly well, and you&apos;ll find that playing popular games like Honkai: Star Rail or Fortnite is basically impossible here. You can get them running on it but neither phone will offer a smooth experience.</p>

<p>Thankfully, most other applications run just fine on both devices. We&apos;ve seen Motorola devices struggle to offer smooth performance on high refresh rate displays in the past, but both Moto G 5G and Moto G Power 5G phones keep up a consistent refresh rate while using popular apps. In other words, all the most basic tasks will work just fine on both phones.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re someone who finds themself switching between multiple apps every time you pick up your phone, you&apos;d best stick with the Moto G Power 5G. That&apos;s because it doubles the amount of RAM that&apos;s in the Moto G 5G, providing an ample 8GB of RAM. The Moto G 5G 2024&apos;s 4GB of RAM is quite small in 2024 when one app might take a few gigs just for itself.</p><p>Motorola offers a "RAM boost" feature that&apos;s enabled out of the box, but I&apos;d recommend turning this off no matter which phone you use. While it&apos;s advertised to virtually increase RAM and provide better performance, I found that the opposite was true. Apps were regularly unstable, and the phone would have a harder time switching between apps when I had this feature enabled.</p>

<p>If the camera is the most important part of a smartphone, I would recommend not buying <em>either</em> of these phones. Instead, take a look at a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-preorders-and-release-date-how-to-buy-the-budget-phone">Google Pixel 6a deal</a>, instead. The phone is often on sale for $299 or less and offers a substantially better camera than Motorola&apos;s offerings here.</p><p>But if you&apos;d rather stick with Motorola, the Moto G Power 5G offers a better experience overall. While the main camera on both Moto G 5G and Moto G Power 5G capture similar quality photos, it&apos;s the other two cameras that get the real upgrade.</p>

<p>Motorola stuck a useless 2MP "macro camera" on the Moto G 5G 2024 that takes truly awful pictures in any light. Meanwhile, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 sports an 8MP ultrawide camera that&apos;s really not half bad.</p><p>Likewise, the front-facing camera on the Moto G 5G 2024 takes extremely soft photos, even in broad daylight. The Moto G Power 5G 2024&apos;s front-facing camera is double the resolution and looks it in every shot.</p>

<p>While the Moto G Power 5G 2024&apos;s processor is only marginally better than the one in the Moto G 5G 2024, the rest of the package is a pretty noticeable upgrade. The display is more than double the resolution, and Motorola even doubled the RAM on the phone. That means multitasking is substantially better on the Moto G Power than the Moto G 5G.</p><p>Not only that, but the Moto G 5G&apos;s macro camera is entirely useless, while the Moto G Power swaps that camera out for a far more useful 8MP ultrawide one. Plus, selfies just look better on the G Power, thanks to the upgraded front-facing sensor.</p><p>In short, if you just need a basic phone that&apos;s got great design and lets you effortlessly browse social networks and communicate with friends, the Moto G 5G 2024 is a great pick. Otherwise, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 does everything else better.</p>

<hr>
<p>April Fools&apos; Day is over, and ironically, April 2 brings International Fact-Checking Day. If you wished there was a way to figure out whether all the April Fools&apos; Day pranks you saw online were legit or fake, you&apos;re in luck. To recognize International Fact-Checking Day, Google is expanding the reach of some of its most useful tools in Google Search for verifying facts, images, and sources. In addition, Google today <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-fact-checking-resources/">announced</a> that its Fact Check Explorer is exiting beta and will be widely available. </p><p><strong>About this image</strong> and <strong>About this page</strong> aren&apos;t new features, but they are now available in 40 more languages globally. These tools are built right into Google Search, so users can quickly and easily find out more information about a result. For example, if you open an image&apos;s detail menu in Search and tap the About this image option, you&apos;ll be able to learn more about an image and where it came from. Specifically, Google says that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-about-this-image-rollout">About this image</a> can list the following types of information about an image in Search:</p>
<ul><li>The history of an image</li><li>How the image is used and described by other sites</li><li>The metadata attached to an image</li></ul>
<p>The hope is that About this page info might help you discern whether an image is real or fake. This information could reveal whether an image was AI-generated or came from an untrustworthy source.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:213.52%;"><img id="Cfa5voEqyKg9vbMrXduSWT" name="Google-search-about-this-image.gif" alt="A demo of About this page in Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cfa5voEqyKg9vbMrXduSWT.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="281" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, <strong>About this page</strong> and <strong>About this result </strong>will tell you more about a given website before you decide to click on a Google Search result. This could reveal whether the site is trustworthy, if it is believed to be biased in some way, and who owns it. Google pulls from Wikipedia&apos;s description of a website and other mentions of the site across the web to curate the <strong>About the source</strong> result.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="UmJCUKXepSMCfYDR7Fp9sZ" name="Google-Search-about-this-page.gif" alt="About this page in Google Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UmJCUKXepSMCfYDR7Fp9sZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google will continue to show articles from fact-checking sources in Google Search results. However, it is also making a specialized tool for media members and fact-checkers publicly available. While the <strong>Fact Check Explorer</strong> was previously available in beta, it is now exiting beta and available today on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer/search/list:recent;hl=en" target="_blank">Google&apos;s Fact Check Tools website</a>.</p><p>Essentially, the Fact Check Explorer serves as a hub for fact-check content on the web. When you search for a fact check in Google Search, the results may be cluttered with unrelated or untrustworthy content. By comparison, the Fact Check Explorer specifically includes only fact-check articles from trusted sources and independent organizations worldwide. Fact Check Explorer also works for images, and entering an image URL can quickly reveal whether it has been included in a prior investigation. </p><p>All of these tools and features are available starting today, so you can try them out immediately in Google Search.</p>

At $350, it&apos;s $150 less than the Pixel 7a (and likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>), all while offering flagship design, a better display than anything in its price range, and battery life and charging speed that&apos;ll make anyone happy.</p><p>With the Pixel 8a&apos;s likely release just on the horizon — most likely to be announced at Google I/O 2024 on May 14 — there are a few things Google could do to keep Nothing from seriously eating into its hard-earned Pixel A-series market share. Doubtless, it&apos;ll be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phone</a> in its price range when it releases so long as Google keeps up with the Joneses, but here are some things the Pixel 8a can take away from the Nothing Phone 2a.</p>
<h2 id="price-2">Price</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DP3BgDKDBAyGRfaFtsfLB4" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-with-box.jpg" alt="Unboxing the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DP3BgDKDBAyGRfaFtsfLB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8a is expected to debut at the same $499 price as the Pixel 7a. That&apos;s a $50 price hike over previous Pixel A-series generations but the 7a improved the overall experience by including a better display, better fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, and even a camera upgrade.</p><p>While all of those things were important, it&apos;s more important that Google doesn&apos;t increase the price <em>yet again</em> this year to ensure it stays under the magic $500 price tag.</p><p>The obvious problem is that the Nothing Phone 2a is $150 cheaper than that, and it&apos;s likely going to be difficult to say that the Pixel 8a will be worth so much more than Nothing&apos;s first budget-focused phone.</p>
<h2 id="design-2">Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="7Kx2rFhbjN4TvviibsLswY" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-cameras.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 7a to the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Kx2rFhbjN4TvviibsLswY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s Pixel design has been nothing short of incredible for the past few years, and it would be a shame to see Google ruin that now. The latest Pixel 9 leaks look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">pretty darn ugly</a>, but thankfully, Pixel 8a leaks make it look a lot more like the Pixel 8.</p><p>While Nothing&apos;s Glyph Interface and associated transparent design are great, the camera island on the back of the Phone 2a doesn&apos;t look particularly attractive. On the bright side, it&apos;s immediately identifiable as a Nothing Phone because of these unique design aspects.</p><p>Similarly, Google&apos;s iconic camera bar design is immediately recognizable even with a case on the phone. It&apos;s a brilliant design that looks fantastic, and we&apos;d hate to see Google do anything too different. At the least, don&apos;t make it look like the Phone 2a&apos;s weird camera hump.</p>
<h2 id="display-2">Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vEbMbjpeidu7YVXTE2EfNX" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-display-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 7a to the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vEbMbjpeidu7YVXTE2EfNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year, Google upgraded the Pixel 7a with a 90Hz display — an important jump over the sluggish 60Hz on the Pixel 6a. However, the Nothing Phone 2a upped the ante in several important ways, starting with a bright 120Hz OLED display. It can hit 1,300 nits of brightness — 300 more than the Pixel 7a — and the 120Hz display can move between 30Hz and 120Hz depending on the content. The Pixel 7a can only swap between 60 and 90Hz.</p><p>The Pixel 8a could improve on this by matching most of these specs, including the brightness level, which we&apos;ve seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">ramp up significantly</a> in recent years.</p><p>Beyond that, the Nothing Phone 2a display does something <em>far</em> better than any Pixel display, including the high-end ones: it doesn&apos;t flicker at a slow rate. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users like myself have a hard time using Pixel phones because they traditionally flicker at a 240Hz rate. The Pixel 7a uses a 360Hz rate, but that&apos;s still not high enough for sensitive users.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s display doesn&apos;t flicker at all above 50% brightness, while it switches to PWM dimming at 1920Hz below 50% brightness. Google needs to ramp up its PWM rate to match what&apos;s quickly becoming an industry norm, helping both sensitive users and preventing users from becoming sensitive by staring at a slowly flickering display.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life-2">Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VZRPbPLqgw37kFwJw4T6dX" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-01.jpg" alt="The transparent back of the grey Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VZRPbPLqgw37kFwJw4T6dX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7a have any specific weakness, it&apos;s battery life. The Tensor G2 inside the Pixel 7a was more battery efficient than the Tensor G1 inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a>, and as we saw from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, the Tensor G3 that should be inside the Pixel 8a is even <em>more</em> battery efficient.</p><p>However, Tensor&apos;s battery efficiency pales in comparison to the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro inside the Nothing Phone 2a, which positively sips battery all day long. We regularly got two days of battery life out of a single charge on the Nothing Phone 2a.</p><p>While we&apos;re not hopeful that we&apos;ll see the same kind of battery life out of the Pixel 8a, any sort of improvement over the Pixel 6a and 7a&apos;s battery life would be a welcome improvement.</p>
<h2 id="charging-speed-2">Charging speed</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZN9VWfZAqPgKhkTYE7DtzL" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-02.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone 2a with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZN9VWfZAqPgKhkTYE7DtzL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google added wireless charging on the Pixel 7a — a first for a Pixel A-series phone — but it&apos;s relatively useless at just 5W charging speed. It&apos;s understandable that Google has to cut corners somewhere to keep the phone under $500, but it&apos;s almost worse when an important feature gets added only to have it not work very well.</p><p>If the Pixel 8a includes wireless charging, it needs to be at least 10W. The Pixel 8 series supports 15W wireless charging, so this will feel like a reasonable price concession while still offering something useful. The Nothing Phone 2a doesn&apos;t support wireless charging at all, which could give Google a notable advantage over Nothing&apos;s budget phone.</p><p>However, Google Pixel phones have never supported 45W fast charging like the Nothing Phone 2a, and I find that far more valuable than any wireless charging method. Faster overall charging would help solve the battery life issue in the above section, making topping up halfway through a day no big deal. The current 18W charging speed of the Pixel A-series just isn&apos;t enough.</p>
<h2 id="sustained-performance-2">Sustained performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.92%;"><img id="zy8uRxm2Qzktq4QgQaqahf" name="nothing-phone-2a-benchmarks-geekbench-burnout-bench.jpg" alt="Comparing the Nothing Phone 2a with the Nothing Phone 1 and Google Pixel 7a in benchmarks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zy8uRxm2Qzktq4QgQaqahf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 6a and 7a offer the best peak performance of any phone in its class, but Tensor has a bad reputation for overheating and slowing down <em>a lot</em> when running anything that requires fast processing. As you can see from the grey chart above, the Pixel 7a loses a substantial amount of performance in no time flat.</p><p>Meanwhile, the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro in the Nothing Phone 2a does a much, much better job of keeping performance high even after 30 minutes or longer of heavy processing. If you&apos;re a mobile gamer, this metric is particularly important for you.</p><p>Google could improve this with better thermal management in the Pixel 8a and it would help the phone feel faster if it could keep its high-performance capabilities intact for more than just a few minutes, at the most.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="budinWKc3URmySEPpGC6mW" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Comparing the Google Pixel 7a to the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/budinWKc3URmySEPpGC6mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To this day, no phone under $500 takes pictures as well as the Pixel 7a. The competition, including the Nothing Phone 2a, simply doesn&apos;t stand a chance. We have little doubts that the Pixel 8a will differ from this at all — rumors and leaks suggest Google isn&apos;t changing anything meaningful about the camera hardware — but Google could stand to improve some parts of the camera <strong>software</strong>.</p><p>Nothing offers a proper manual mode on its phone, despite lacking some other features Google&apos;s camera offers, and it makes the Nothing Phone 2a&apos;s capabilities seem greater despite the opposite being true. If Google could bring over the excellent manual camera mode from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, it would be a massive advantage over other companies in this segment.</p>
<h2 id="software-updates-2">Software updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB" name="Google-Pixel-7a-display-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's vibrant, bright display showcasing the home screen with the default coral feathers wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Aside from the camera, one of the best reasons to get a Pixel is the support from Google. Google has long offered many years of software updates more than other Android phone manufacturers, and the Pixel 8 series pushed this further than ever with seven years of guaranteed major software updates.</p><p>Plus, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">Pixel 8 getting Gemini Nano</a>, it seems like there&apos;s never been a better reason to get a Pixel phone with its excellent support. But Google&apos;s updates haven&apos;t been particularly <em>reliable</em> recently, and that&apos;s the real elephant in the room.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a is only scheduled to get three major OS updates and four years of security updates, but Nothing has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-2-5-4-a-update">already delivered three updates</a> for the phone since launch and has, historically, been excellent about quality updates. Google could certainly learn a thing or two from Nothing in this regard, and that could certainly start with a brand-new phone.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s been no official announcement, we&apos;re extremely certain that the Google Pixel 8a will be announced at Google I/O 2024 on May 14. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a rumor roundup</a> covers everything that&apos;s been leaked or rumored so far, and the details are quite juicy.</p><p>All in all, it looks like Google is going to deliver another winner this year, but some of that success hinges on Google adapting to changes throughout the rest of the industry. The Nothing Phone 2a is an excellent example of how to deliver a good budget phone without much compromise, and Google&apos;s more mid-range price should offer up even better specs with longer software support.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AWOL Vision isn&apos;t a brand that would be familiar to many; I didn&apos;t hear of the brand until last year, when I was researching ultra short throw (UST) projectors with a high brightness. While most brands have a selection of products — mostly aimed at the budget and mid-range tiers — AWOL Vision does things a bit differently; it only sells UST laser projectors, and given the tech on offer, they&apos;re aimed at the high-end segment.</p><p>I used a half-dozen UST projectors over the course of the last five years, and there has been a steady increase of new entrants rolling out enticing new features in the last 18 months. AWOL Vision&apos;s LTV series stands out because of Dolby Vision; there aren&apos;t many UST projectors that offer the feature, so I was automatically interested in taking a look at what the brand is doing in this category.</p><p>The only other projector I tested that had Dolby Vision was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">XGIMI Horizon Ultra</a>, but it was a regular laser projector. What makes AWOL Vision&apos;s LTV-3000 Pro all the more alluring is that it uses UST tech, so you can position it right up against a wall and still get a large image. I used the LTV-3000 Pro for just over three months now, and here&apos;s what I think of the UST projector.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-pricing-and-release-date"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Pricing and release date</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RbX6fSZpgzmZUDATUm6XUG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-11.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RbX6fSZpgzmZUDATUm6XUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AWOL Vision unveiled the LTV-3000 Pro in December 2023, and the projector is now available in select global markets. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0CR13MB4F">for $3,999 on Amazon U.S.</a>, but you can get $500 off, bringing the cost down to $3,499. The LTV-3000 Pro sits in the middle of AWOL Vision&apos;s portfolio; the base variant is the LTV-2500, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0B6HXCMQJ">available for $2,599</a> as of writing. There&apos;s a high-end model dubbed LTV-3500 Pro that has 3,500 lumens of brightness, and that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AWOL-VISION-LTV-3000-Projector-Theater/dp/B0CR15NXFD">currently retailing for $5,599 on Amazon</a>.</p><p>All three models have the same design and connectivity, and the only difference is the brightness of the projection; the LTV-2500 goes up to 2,600 lumens, and the LTV-3500 Pro hits 3,500 lumens. You get Dolby Vision and a 4K projection as standard, and plenty of customizability when it comes to color balance and picture modes.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-design"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ptfs7rKeTHZXcLgrWgg3uD" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-12.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ptfs7rKeTHZXcLgrWgg3uD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro has a bold design that immediately grabs attention. I previously used the XGIMI Aura as my go-to UST projector, and while it also has a distinct styling, it doesn&apos;t look quite as futuristic. The smooth lines combined with the liberal use of metal trim gives the LTV-3000 Pro a lot of visual flair, and I love the way the projector curves around the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nJUdKngEp78jkFdTQNd3TC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-3.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJUdKngEp78jkFdTQNd3TC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro is just as massive as some of the other 4K UST projectors I tested, and it delivers all the features you need in a stylish package. My only quibble is the choice of color; the projector is available in black, and the glossy plastic that&apos;s used on the sides is a dust magnet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6Q3dzoFUbxf3pjsAvPKAmJ" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-15.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Q3dzoFUbxf3pjsAvPKAmJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no issues with the design. There are large vents on the sides to deliver airflow into the chassis, with the vent on the right serving as the intake and the one on the left the exhaust. There&apos;s a power button up top, and you get AWOL Vision branding along with the usual Dolby labels, and a Tri-Chroma Laser moniker on one side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R8ykdXzVSQp3D4pt2auWwC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-22.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8ykdXzVSQp3D4pt2auWwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The four rubber feet at the bottom make it easy to position the projector, and you can make any necessary adjustments to elevation. The projection lens sits in an island, and it has a larger outlet than some of its rivals, with AWOL Vision noting that it delivers better clarity even at a 150-inch projection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dkFnJaQuJd4sMjtjJ9pfnG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-20.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkFnJaQuJd4sMjtjJ9pfnG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s the usual proximity sensor that switches off the laser when it detects an object, and I found that it was a tad too sensitive — it would switch off the screen even when I was walking by the projector. Overall, the LTV-3000 Pro certainly looks the part of a high-end UST projector, and the bold design combined with the build quality make it a great choice in this category.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-features"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qSBydbxy5ZF2txYzBApZvB" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-1.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qSBydbxy5ZF2txYzBApZvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LTV-3000 Pro isn&apos;t lacking when it comes to features; the UST projector is able to deliver a projection of up to 150 inches, and it uses a Texas Instruments 0.47 Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) along with a custom Ricoh lens to deliver a 4K projection with a contrast of 2500:1.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6GzF4ZTtMsUxXVJgfhxW8D" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-19.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GzF4ZTtMsUxXVJgfhxW8D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the Tri-Chroma Laser branding suggests, it uses a three-laser light source that goes up to 3,000 lumens of brightness, and AWOL Vision touts a longevity of 25,000 hours for the laser, which is significantly more than what you get with traditional projectors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cyCdRpRYcP9c27CN8B3iNJ" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-13.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyCdRpRYcP9c27CN8B3iNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of connectivity, the LTV-3000 Pro has Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 5.0, and you get three HDMI 2.0 ports at the back (one with eARC), two USB 2.0 ports that let you connect an external drive to the projector, digital audio out, and Ethernet. As for the hardware, you get 3GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>There&apos;s 8-point keystone correction, and like other UST projectors, the LTV-3000 Pro has a standby mode where it consumes just 0.5W of power.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-picture-quality-and-sound"><span>AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro: Picture quality and sound</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3LEkYA3fCoMszCMQu4Wb5J" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-27.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LEkYA3fCoMszCMQu4Wb5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest selling point of the LTV-3000 Pro is that it is able to deliver an image that goes up to 3,000 lumens. That&apos;s significantly higher than the 1,800-lumen that the XGIMI Aura manages, and having used that projector for the better part of two years, there was an immediate difference when switching over to the LTV-3000 Pro.</p>
<p>Most UST projectors don&apos;t get as bright, and that doesn&apos;t make them as versatile as TVs; you&apos;ll mostly need to position them in a dark room with the blinds closed. But this is not an issue with the LTV-3000 Pro, and even with plenty of ambient light in the room, the projector was able to deliver a bright image that&apos;s more than serviceable. Heck, this UST projector gets brighter than most regular laser projectors, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9FyZqyBzWmgrTPLcHr5DLG" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-28.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FyZqyBzWmgrTPLcHr5DLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector has six modes — Standard, Vivid, Movie, Sport, Game, and User — and in my usage, I found the Movie mode to have the best color rendition. Both SDR and HDR content was rendered with plenty of detail and color vibrancy, and AWOL Vision did a great job calibrating the colors out of the box. What I also like is the sheer customizability on offer; you can easily change the white balance, contrast, saturation, and tweak the color balance as needed (in User mode).</p><p>I streamed a lot of content on the LTV-3000 Pro in the three months I used the projector, and I had zero issues with picture quality. Color balance and black levels are terrific throughout, and it does a far sight better than any other UST projector I tested thus far, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/vava-chroma-4k-laser-ultra-short-throw-projector-review">VAVA Chroma</a>.</p>

<p>The projector does a terrific job with HDR content, and it played Netflix&apos;s Dolby Vision titles without breaking a sweat. It is just as enjoyable for watching movies as well as sports, and its biggest differentiator is the high brightness levels. What&apos;s particularly great is that you get a 24fps option, and at the other end of the scale, there&apos;s MEMC.</p>
<p>You can also use the projector for gaming, and the dedicated Game mode lowers the latency down to 15ms. It doesn&apos;t manage 4K at 120Hz, but if you&apos;re looking to connect a console to a large screen, the LTV-3000 Pro is a great option. You can get 120Hz in 1080p, and the latency is as low as 8ms in this mode.</p>
<p>I set up the LTV-3000 Pro to deliver a 95-inch projection, but it goes up to 150 inches, using a throw ratio of 0.25:1. . The projector has two built-in audio drives that deliver 36W of sound, and it does a decent enough job in its own right. That said, you&apos;ll ideally need to pair it with a good soundbar.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AZDTmGbEDRrYw7b5FkdJcD" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-8.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZDTmGbEDRrYw7b5FkdJcD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design of the LTV-3000 Pro is clearly futuristic, the same cannot be said of the remote. It looks a bit chintzy and something out of the &apos;90s, and it doesn&apos;t have any similarities to the projector itself. The silver design looks gaudy, and it has too many buttons that are of little to no use.</p><p>The biggest issue is that there&apos;s no backlight, and that makes using the remote more cumbersome than it needs to be. The only good thing about it is that you won&apos;t have to use it after setting up the projector to your preferences.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HPH6x9CiZRAqqH2p7DtRqE" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-5.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPH6x9CiZRAqqH2p7DtRqE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AWOL Vision has a barebones software interface based on Android 9.0, and it doesn&apos;t offer any smarts; there&apos;s no way to install the usual set of streaming services, or do much with the UI at all. Other than switching HDMI sources and changing the projector&apos;s settings, you don&apos;t get many features.</p><p>Thankfully, AWOL Vision offloaded the software problem by bundling Amazon&apos;s streaming stick with the package. Most Chinese brands miss out on Netflix certification on their projectors — this is a constant bugbear on XGIMI&apos;s products — so by just bundling a streaming stick in the box, AWOL Vision doesn&apos;t have to worry about any of that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2pkC2oDvsCqbsdfsFeqRcC" name="awol-vision-ltv-3000-pro-7.jpg" alt="AWOL Vision LTV-3000 Pro UST projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pkC2oDvsCqbsdfsFeqRcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As such, there isn&apos;t much to talk about on the software front. There is a provision at the back of the projector to house the streaming stick — and power it natively — and it is a decent workaround to setting up a custom software interface or go with Android TV and worry about Netflix certification.</p><p>I used the LTV-3000 Pro with my go-to streaming device, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-pro-vs-standard">NVIDIA&apos;s Shield TV Pro</a>, and it turned out to be a terrific combination. The Shield TV Pro is incredibly fluid in daily use, has plenty of customizability, and lets me download all the streaming services I care about.</p>

<p>The XGIMI Aura shares a lot of similarities with the LTV-3000 Pro; it also uses a similar laser light source and delivers terrific colors out of the box. It doesn&apos;t get as bright as the LTV-3000 Pro, but it is more than adequate if you don&apos;t have too much ambient light. And at $1,699, it is much more affordable.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a UST projector that gets bright</li><li>You want a projector with Dolby Vision</li><li>You need accurate colors with plenty of configurability</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want Android TV out of the box</li></ul>
<p>Honestly, AWOL Vision ticked all the right boxes with the LTV-3000 Pro. The projector is the brightest I tested yet, and it does a terrific job even if you have a lot of ambient light coming through. You get excellent colors and contrast levels, and there&apos;s enough customizability that you can tweak the color balance to your preferences.</p><p>The LTV-3000 Pro does a standout job with HDR content and Dolby Vision in particular, and the various modes make a difference in daily use; this is a versatile projector that can be used in a variety of settings. A big drawback with most new entrants in this segment is the software, and that&apos;s not an issue here. The only downside is the remote, but other than that, I don&apos;t have anything to fault with the LTV-3000 Pro.</p><p>It is costlier than its rivals, but if you want a bright projection with Dolby Vision and a decent amount of customizability, the LTV-3000 Pro is a standout choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>This week, Google agreed to clear a trove of browsing data in an attempt to settle the infamous Incognito mode lawsuit, which was first brought to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">light in 2020</a>, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-pledges-to-destroy-browsing-data-to-settle-incognito-lawsuit-1febfde5">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that Google Chrome was tracking its users&apos; browsing data even while in &apos;incognito&apos; mode, which allows users to browse without saving their browsing history. It also claims that the tech giant was not upfront about its data policies and misled its customers.</p><p>Earlier in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-incognito-mode-update">January</a>, Google admitted that it tracks users while in Incognito mode, even if Chrome doesn&apos;t save their browsing data. Even though it clearly states each time you open a new Incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session.</p><p>According to the publication, the settlement details were filed at the San Francisco federal court, stating that the company will now work on changing its policies around private browsing. </p><p>Additionally, Google has agreed to destroy billions of data points that the lawsuit alleges were improperly collected, to update disclosures on its website stating the corrected policies on private browsing, and also to give Chrome users the ability to turn off third-party cookies.</p><p>"At a high level, we made several important changes to our disclosures to provide clarification on how your data is collected and how visible your activities are when you visit a website using Incognito Mode," a Google spokesperson stated.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that Google violated federal wiretapping laws through this discrepancy. As compensation, the plaintiffs asked for a minimum of $5 billion, although Google confirmed to Android Central that it would not pay these damages. Nonetheless, Boies notes that the settlement represents "a historic step in requiring honesty and accountability from dominant technology companies." Boies said.</p><p>WSJ states that the agreement still needs final approval from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the Northern District of California.</p><p>Android Central contacted Google about this settlement, and a spokesperson said that they were pleased to settle this lawsuit, which they always believed was meritless. </p><p>"We never associate data with users when they use Incognito mode. We are happy to delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was never used for any form of personalization," Castañeda added.</p>
