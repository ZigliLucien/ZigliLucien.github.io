<hr>
<p>Oura is detailing a new feature for two of its smart rings that could help you get ahead of those sick days.</p><p>The company highlighted the coming arrival of "Symptom Radar" for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> and Gen 3 members. The post states that the feature works by monitoring "changes in your data." According to Oura, the data it sifts through <em>could </em>indicate that something is "straining" your body, like sickness. Wearing your Oura ring will give the app the information it needs to function, such as your skin temperature, average temperature "trends," respiratory rate, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and inactive time.</p><p>The post states users will find their Symptom Radar in the Oura app by navigating to the Today tab. Tapping its highlight card will produce its full page. Moreover, the radar can be accessed more regularly through the hamburger menu in the top left of the Today tab.</p><p>Symptom Radar displays signs of strain in three levels, with the first being "No Signs." Oura says this means that your ring has not detected an "obvious sign" in your biometrics that points toward bodily stress. "Minor Signs" means that there is something there or "small signs" that could indicate approaching sickness.</p><p>Lastly, "Major Signs" means that in your biometrics, your ring has detected "stronger signs" that something is working against your body. Oura says that "Biometrics under strain" section will explain which parts of your data show the most signs of stress. If there is a significant change in your trends, this could indicate sickness/stress.</p>

<p>Oura adds that it looks at multiple pieces of data to see if there's a "deviation in combination" of everything it's collected. If there are major signs or, perhaps, minimal ones, Oura will suggest taking a rest day.</p><p>The press release states that users enabling Rest Mode will see their activity scores paused alongside any goals and activity contributors. However, Symptom Radar will continue to work in the background whilst Rest Mode is active.</p><p>Oura offered a few advisories, stating Symptom Radar may not work with "pre-existing medical conditions." Additionally, pregnancy may impact "biometric baselines" and affect the accuracy of the feature. Oura adds that this radar can be turned off if you are pregnant. What's more, the company reiterates that its rings are not a "medical device." It seems wise to take what Symptom Radar is telling you and see a medical professional if <em>you </em>feel concerned.</p><p>Oura states Symptom Radar is rolling out to all members with a Ring 4 or Gen 3 on December 9 in the app.</p><p>In a separate post, Oura detailed the long development history of its Symptom Radar. The science and process of it stretches back to March 2020. However, Oura's April launch of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-labs-members-test-experience-announced">Labs experience</a> helped further its progress. During its early testing, the company stated users found it difficult to know if Symptom Radar's information had been updated. As a result, Oura states it provides a historical graph so users can see the different updates the feature has made.</p><p>More importantly, the post says testers reported increased interest in seeing which biometric changes "indicated risk." Oura states users will now see markers for a changed piece of data and "why the risk increased."</p><p>Seeing as the colder months are here, Symptom Radar may help users as we enter flu season.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming One UI 7 update, based on Android 15, has experienced numerous delays, but a beta is available now.</li><li>The update is expected to debut near or alongside the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series in January.</li><li>One UI 7 adds new features like the <strong>Now Bar</strong>, new <strong>camera toggles</strong>, and persistent <strong>Writing Tools</strong>.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung today announced that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">after numerous delays</a>, the first One UI 7 beta is now available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a>. The company says that Samsung Members can apply for access to the One UI 7 beta starting today to gain early access to the Android 15-based update. Otherwise, the upgrade is expected to launch early next year alongside the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, as the company confirms One UI 7 will release publicly in the first quarter of 2025.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/extra-one-ui-7-features-samsung-early-post-leak">One UI 7</a> is set to launch with "upcoming Galaxy S series devices," but will arrive on other Galaxy devices as part of a gradual rollout. For now, the Samsung Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra are the only three models known for certain to be eligible for the One UI 7 beta immediately. It's possible that the beta could be expanded to include the Galaxy S24 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>As was expected, Samsung is doubling down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> with One UI 7. It's specifically trying to compete with Apple Intelligence with more system-wide software tools. For example, Writing Tools — a set of generative AI-based grammar and writing options — are now able to be used anywhere without needing to switch apps.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung touts that One UI 7 will bring "more intuitive interaction and greater personalization," with AI at the heart of it.</p>

<p>Samsung also shared a few details about the new features One UI 7 will bring. A <strong>Now Bar</strong> will become a new part of the One UI lock screen, making it possible for users to see important notifications dynamically without needing to open their phone. Additionally, the Camera app in One UI 7 is getting a boost, as the viewfinder now includes new buttons, controls, and modes. In another Apple Intelligence-inspired feature, <strong>Call Transcript</strong> will automatically transcribe recorded calls in 20 supported languages.</p><p>A few security improvements add a <strong>Knox Matrix dashboard</strong> that lets users view their connected devices in one place, <strong>Credential Syncs</strong>, and a new recovery method for data transfers.</p><p>You can apply to gain access to the One UI 7 beta and test these features for yourself by becoming a Samsung Member if you have a Galaxy S24 series device.</p>

While Google usually releases these builds in Q1, the brand is changing its strategy this time around, and is making the release available earlier. There's a good reason for this: with the debut of the Pixels pushed up, Google wants to have the latest Android version ready before it announces hardware, and as a result, we're getting Android 16 just a month after the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> release. <br><br>That's a good thing, as it means more devices will come with the latest version of Android installed out of the box. While brands do a decent job rolling out the stable Android update to their high-end phones, most mid-range phones take several months to make the switch, and this won't be as big an issue if the update itself is available sooner. While details are scant at the moment, here's what you need to know about when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> might be available on your device.</p>

<p>If you have a Pixel 6 and above, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 16 beta</a> right now. That said, I wouldn't recommend installing the build right now; there are no visible user-facing changes, and most of the under-the-hood tweaks aren't aimed at end users anyway. <br><br>That will change over the coming months as Google starts adding features to Android 16, and when the time comes, I will share additional details on what's new, and whether it makes sense to install Android 16 on your Pixel. Until then though, Android 15 is still the best choice.</p>

<p>Samsung is yet to introduce its Android 15-based One UI 7, and the focus for the brand is to get that out the door. We should see the One UI 7 beta sometime later this month, but as of now, Samsung hasn't detailed plans around Android 16. With the Galaxy S25 series launching in January, we should know more early next year.</p>

<p>OPPO just introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and Find X8 in global markets, and both devices run Android 15 out of the box. While there's no details on Android 16 just yet, we should have additional details once the public beta goes live sometime in Q1 2025. <br><br>Although ColorOS 15 just went live, OPPO is internally testing ColorOS 16, and will launch the version alongside Android 16 sometime in Q2 2025. At this point, there's no details on new features coming to the interface.</p>

<p>Vivo's X200 and X200 Pro are going global later this month, and they also run Android 15 out of the box. Similar to ColorOS 15, there's no telling when Vivo will start rolling out Android 16-based Funtouch OS, but with the manufacturer doing a much better job in this area, it shouldn't take too long once the stable build becomes available in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-you-should-wait-for-the-oneplus-13-and-two-reasons-not-to">OnePlus 13</a> is launching globally in January, and it will run OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15. OnePlus is usually good with beta software releases, and it tends to roll out public betas to its devices once they become available. It's a good bet that the OnePlus 13 will get the public beta sometime in Q1 2025, but there's no confirmation about that as yet — I talked to the manufacturer about the same, and will update once I know more.</p>

<p>Honor's had a busy year, and its Magic 7 series is all set to make its global debut in the coming weeks. The phone comes with MagicOS 9.0 based on Android 15. Honor is leaning heavily into AI, and that is continuing with MagicOS 9.0, with the brand partnering with Google to deliver a suite of AI utilities. At this moment, there's no details of when Honor will kickstart its Android 16 beta, but it should be sometime after the initial public build becomes available.</p>

<p>As is always the case with Xiaomi, the manufacturer has several devices launching in December and January. The Xiaomi 15 should make its global debut sometime this month, but ahead of that, the Redmi Note 14 is launching in India, and that device is coming with Android 14. <br><br>Xiaomi has been leveraging this strategy over the last three years to get out of delivering long-term software updates, and this is the main reason why I don't recommend Redmi Note devices any longer. If every other brand is able to launch phones with Android 15 out of the box, there's no reason why Xiaomi can't do the same.</p>

<p>There isn't much in the way of information regarding Android 16 at the moment, that will change over the coming weeks. Given the accelerated timeline, it will be interesting to see if the update will make its way to additional devices. If you're on an eligible Pixel, I wouldn't suggest installing Android 16 right now — there's no incentive to do so. Again, that should change once we get user-facing changes, and I'll update this post as soon as new builds go live.</p>

For example, I was shocked to see that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6"><strong>Amazon is </strong><em><strong>still </strong></em><strong>carving 53% off the Galaxy Watch 6 following the major sale event,</strong></a> a leftover deal that drops the beloved Samsung watch to its lowest price EVER. As of writing, the retailer is claiming to have only 20 of these watches left in stock, so I would act fast if you're interested. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><em><strong>Samsung's Cyber Week sale is LIVE — see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>Despite being a last-gen wearable, the Galaxy Watch 6 continues to impress as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> around, thanks to its sophisticated blend of sleek design choices, snappy Exynos performance, and loads of RAM. It even has a lot of the same hardware and display tech as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, Samsung's latest smartwatch.</p><p>If we were talking about full price here, I'd say go with the newer model — but pair the Galaxy Watch 6 with a $139.99 price tag? That's an amazing deal, just in time for the holidays.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Pixel Troubleshooting update gets new Device Temperature check feature.</li><li>It allows Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 users to check their device temperatures whenever their devices seem warm to touch.</li><li>The temperature check feature involves relevant color schemes to accurately represent the device's condition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Pixel phones might have a nifty new feature that lets users identify how hot their devices are running directly from their handsets' battery settings.</p><p>Google has apparently released a Pixel Troubleshooting app update for its devices, ranging from Pixel 6 to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>, notes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/02/pixel-9-temperature-troubleshooting/">9to5Google</a>. The latest update brings a new "Device temperature" feature, which can be seen in the Battery section of the device Settings.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="mXRQoZnPyFJskUdLNWjYgi" name="Pixel-9-device-temperature-feature-1" alt="Pixel Device temperature feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mXRQoZnPyFJskUdLNWjYgi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="3Si4Jt7ToqjdRQJVZgKMhi" name="Pixel-9-device-temperature-feature" alt="Pixel Device temperature feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Si4Jt7ToqjdRQJVZgKMhi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>It sits under the battery diagnostics' "Phone is very warm" section, which earlier showcased settings that keep the device battery optimized. Another way to access the new page is to directly search for "Device temperature" through the Settings app.</p><p>Under the Device temperature, users can now find four relevant colors, evidently dubbed Cold, Normal, Warm, and Elevated, indicating the current temperature state of the device.</p>
<p>The new page further indicates that the projected device temperature is according to various internal sensors that the aforementioned Pixel phones already ship with. 9to5 further notes that users can also witness other tips like "To cool down your phone, provide airflow to your phone if possible" and "Use only cases or covers made for your specific phone," among others.</p><p>The live device temperature is being rolled out via the Pixel Troubleshooting app bearing the <strong>1.0.693922709</strong> version. Pixel phones include the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and the Pixel 9 series. It has not yet been rolled out to Pixel Tablet. As 9to5 notes, the update was seen running on the devices mentioned above, running on stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">recently rolled out</a> to all compatible Pixel phones.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Pixel Troubleshooting app was introduced last year, and the Pixel 8 was one of the first handsets to receive the feature. It helps users diagnose their battery and network issues, and the new temperature feature is indeed a valuable addition as it eliminates the need for installing third-party apps or devices to measure the device's temperature.</p>

<ul><li>Google shared that it managed to double Chrome's score in Speedometer 2.1, a browser benchmark, on Android devices.</li><li>The feat was achieved by optimizing Chrome for more premium devices and advanced Arm architectures, like Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>Google says these improvements will be noticeable in daily use, while doing things like loading a Google Doc on the Pixel Tablet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If the Google Chrome on Android feels faster lately, especially on more premium Android phones and tablets, it's not just you. Google says that Chrome for Android experienced significant increases in scores and overall performance in a popular browser benchmark Speedometer 2.1, since Chrome version M112 released last year. Now that Speedometer 3.0 is out, Google is reporting that devices with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset are crushing the new benchmark, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>From version M122 to the current version M129, Google is seeing Speedometer scores more than double on many Android devices. That's due to build optimizations, improvements to the JavaScript engine and rendering engine, and optimization for OS versions and systems-on-a-chips (SoCs).</p><p>The improvements began with Chrome M113, when Google introduced a new version of Chrome for Android. For the first time, there was a separate build of Chrome available for high-end devices that maximized their performance capabilities. Google says that creating separate builds for high and low-performance devices allowed it to better optimize for flagship chips. For example, it built the new, high-performance build of Chrome for Arm64, making use of the efficiency of Arm's 64-bit instruction set.</p><p>You can see these improvements when Chrome is paired with the latest silicon, such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the first to use custom Oryon cores for mobile. In the Speedometer 3.0 benchmark shared by Google below, the difference between the same browser's performance on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 versus Snapdragon 8 Elite is stark.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:972px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:38.27%;"><img id="SguE3SKXLhFmUsA79NjYaX" name="Speedometer-Chrome-Benchmark" alt="The Speedometer benchmark running on various Snapdragon chips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SguE3SKXLhFmUsA79NjYaX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="972" height="372" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google thinks these improvements will translate to daily use of Chrome on high-end Android phones and tablets, too. In the below test, provided by Google, Chrome M129 on the Pixel Tablet loaded a Google Doc webpage 50% faster than the older M112 version on the same device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:31.25%;"><img id="v2JhTyqri3XiAGH6ZM88gJ" name="Google-Doc-Load-Comparison" alt="A load time comparison between Chrome M112 and M129." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2JhTyqri3XiAGH6ZM88gJ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip specifically resulted in a 60% to 80% improvement in Speedometer 3.0 improvement, and Google says it tweaked Chrome's builds and engines to ensure that the browser wasn't bottlenecking the chip's performance.</p><p>As more phones are released with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, more people will be able to try out the faster version of Chrome for themselves. Even if you have an older devices, recent Chrome releases will likely result in a noticeable speed boost.</p>

<ul><li>The last stage of Samsung’s One UI 6 Watch rollout appears to be underway, with users in Korea seeing the update become available for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.</li><li>The move comes as Samsung has updated the Galaxy Watch 6 series, Galaxy Watch 5 series, and Galaxy Watch FE to Wear OS 5 in recent days and weeks.</li><li>The updates, beginning abroad, will eventually come to the US and North America at a later date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reaching the final stage of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-begins-rolling-out-one-ui-6-watch-for-older-galaxy-watch-models">lengthy One UI 6 Watch rollout</a>, which brings Wear OS 5 to all the company’s Wear OS smartwatches. As of today, users in Korea started seeing the One UI 6 Watch update become available for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%94-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%98-%EB%B2%84%EC%A6%88-%EA%B8%B0%ED%83%80/galaxy-watch-4-one-ui-6-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%9E%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/30461217" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung’s community forums. The update is currently available for only the Bluetooth models of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 series</a>, and only in Korea — for now.</p><p>The company launched One UI 6 Watch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and Galaxy Watch 7, released in July. It made its way to the Galaxy Watch 6 series late last month. Just yesterday, Dec. 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os-5-is-now-rolling-out-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-5-and-watch-fe-models">Samsung brought the Wear OS 5 upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 5 series and the Galaxy Watch FE</a>.</p><p>That means all of Samsung’s Wear OS watches, from the oldest Galaxy Watch 4 to the cheapest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, are beginning to get the boost to One UI 6 Watch. As is typically the case, Bluetooth models of the Galaxy Watch will receive the upgrade in a few regions to start. Then, over the coming days and weeks, LTE-equipped models will become eligible to upgrade, and it’ll arrive in more regions. North American units are often towards the end of the line when it comes to receiving One UI 6 Watch upgrades.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LHF46EhLFdXuLW2sh2vj4" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-energy-score.JPG" alt="Galaxy AI energy score mock-up for One UI 6 Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LHF46EhLFdXuLW2sh2vj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A core part of the One UI 6 Watch update are health-related feature additions. Samsung is banking on the combination of Samsung Health and Galaxy AI, aiming to use it to help wearers improve their fitness and health. Energy Score is like Samsung’s rendition of Garmin’s Body Battery, and Sleep Analysis aims to let you know how well you slept. These features were exclusive to newer Galaxy Watch models at first, but are making their way to older ones now.</p><p>Samsung initially promised up to four years of software updates for the Galaxy Watch 4, which isn’t much of a concrete guarantee. However, it appears that old smartwatch may be nearing the end of its software support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-wear-os-5-1-preview-is-now-available-and-its-based-on-android-15">Wear OS 5.1</a> looks like a minor update, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, so the chances of the Galaxy Watch 4 making it to the eventual Wear OS 6 are slim.</p><p>Still, the first-generation of any product line typically receives poor software support, but that hasn’t been the case with the Galaxy Watch 4 (which is a first-gen product in the sense that it was Samsung’s first Wear OS watch). It’s had a great run with software upgrades, starting with Wear OS 3 and now supporting Wear OS 5.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted working on a new "clear voice" feature for the Recorder app.</li><li>Discoveries within the app's code suggest this feature will weed out annoying "background noises" to reduce their presence and elevate your voice.</li><li>The Recorder app, with Gemini Nano's help, brought a "summarize" function to the Pixel 8 and the app arrived on Chromebooks in November.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted preparing an update for its Recorder app that works harder to keep you clear.</p><p>During an APK teardown by X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-recorder-app-clear-voice-3505186/">Android Authority</a>), it was discovered that the company is working on a "clear voice" feature for the app. From the code, it seems that the primary function of the feature is to "reduce background noise."</p><p>Another string states the app will implement a filter to keep "human speech" while tossing "background sounds."</p><p>The post states the feature wasn't working properly through the early preview in v4.2.20241001.7 of the Recorder app. However, the tipster was able to uncover some advisories about using "clear voice." Within the code, Google features strings that state users cannot use the feature if their phone is in "stereo mode."</p><p>Additionally, the feature does not support the use of an external microphone.</p><p>Once this rolls out, users with the Recorder app must shift their phone into "mono audio" to use the background noise reduction magic. Most of the goodies seem in place, but it's not clear when Google will push this to Pixels.</p>

<p>The Recorder app has been relatively quiet in terms of updates; however, some standouts include its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-recorder-update-transcribe-again">major translation update</a>. Pixel devices can leverage a "Transcribe again" tool that leans on Google's Cloud services. In short, this feature re-transcribes a recording in one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9516618#zippy=%2Ctranscribe-a-recording-again">42 available languages</a>. The process sends your audio recording into the cloud to work its magic before returning it to you.</p><p>Our testing showed that the process takes a few minutes as the file travels.</p><p>More recently, the Recorder app was busy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">new goodies in new places</a>, like the Pixel 8. After the series picked up Gemini Nano, the Recorder app activated its "Summarize" feature for audio files. Leveraging Google's LLM (large language model), users can find a convenient summary of what transpired without listening to a lengthy audio log.</p><p>What's more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">ChromeOS 130 for Chromebooks</a> and Chromebook Plus models picked up a version of the app. Users were granted access to speech-to-text generation, summarization, and title suggestions.</p>

The Watch 2 arrived in March 2024, but perhaps OnePlus wants to align its flagship phone and watch launches for better sales and bundles.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> was the company's first Wear OS watch, and it stunned us with its multi-day battery life, fast performance, and attractive steel design. It also had fundamental issues with software and health accuracy, and other complaints about its size and missing features.</p><p>I polled our two OnePlus Watch 2 reviewers, Harish Jonnalaggadda and Nick Sutrich, while using my experience reviewing the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, to come up with a comprehensive list of everything we want from the OnePlus Watch 3!</p>
<h2 id="two-sizes-and-a-working-crown-2">Two sizes and a working crown</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9" name="oneplus-watch-2-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the OnePlus Watch 2 and 2R shipped in one fairly large size, with a 1.43-inch AMOLED display that matches the 1.43-inch, 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and falls slightly short of the 1.5-inch, 44mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. Unlike both of those watches, it has a 47mm, classic-style case that's large and heavy by any standard — about 80g with the strap.</p><p>Also unlike Google and Samsung, OnePlus only sold that one size option. Harish, who liked the Watch 2's overall look but not its "sizeable bezel" and "bulky" feel, says a smaller Watch 3 is his main request.</p><p>Our first hope for the OnePlus Watch 3 is that it sells a smaller option, most likely a 43mm case with a 1.25- or 1.3-inch display, that still retains a large battery capacity and its MIL-STD-810H-grade steel design.</p><p>Our second hope is that the Watch 3 has a <em>working</em> crown. The Watch 2's top-right crown button was "purely for aesthetics," as you could press to select but not scroll. Some Wear OS functions are annoying to swipe through, which is why Google and Samsung use a crown and digital bezel; let's hope OnePlus gets with the program.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-5-notification-fixes-and-backups-2">Wear OS 5, notification fixes, and backups</h2>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 launched with Wear OS 4 and has two promised version updates, so we expect Wear OS 5 on the Watch 3 at launch. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">Wear OS watches are plagued by slow updates</a>, and brands other than Google and Samsung have typically trailed a year behind them for version updates. So we're crossing our fingers that OnePlus keeps pace and we don't have to wait for OS 5.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> added screen size optimization, reflowing text to fit smaller or larger screens, which would help OnePlus sell a new petite display option. It also added battery optimizations that would make the Watch 3 even <em>more</em> long-lived, plus various fitness tools for more dynamic workouts.</p><p>But OnePlus will have its own spinoff of Wear OS 5, with unique perks and downsides. Case in point, its version of Wear OS 4 doesn't support easy watch backups or transfers to your next Android phone, forcing you to scan a QR code just to transfer your health data. We'd want OnePlus to catch up on this front.</p>

<p>OnePlus uses a unique dual-OS system for its watches, with Wear OS for the main tasks and low-powered, proprietary RTOS running low-powered tasks on the coprocessor. This system is the secret to its 4-day battery life, but it also gave several of us consistent problems with ghost notifications never making it from phone to watch.</p><p>To be fair to OnePlus, we've also seen reports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ghost-vibrations-user-reports">ghost notifications on the Galaxy Watch 7</a>. But OnePlus especially seems to struggle with the issue, and we'd like to see that resolved or reduced by the OnePlus Watch 3 launch.</p><p>Samsung gives its Galaxy Watches unique perks for Samsung phone owners (AI insights, AFib readings, and sleep apnea detection); the same goes for Google and Pixel owners (Pixel call screening, synced watch-phone recordings, Ultra Wideband phone unlock). OnePlus phones dominate our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list, and we'd love to see OnePlus phone owners have unique Wear OS perks of their own to enjoy.</p>

<p>One of our biggest complaints with the OnePlus Watch 2 was with health and activity monitoring. Our reviewer Harish found that it had inconsistent step counts, "hilariously bad" stress data, and bad sleep-stage proportions. And Nick, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">wore the OnePlus Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 2 for a week</a>, found that OnePlus struggled to accurately capture higher heart rates during his workouts.</p><p>Interestingly, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test">I tested the OnePlus Watch 2R's accuracy</a>, it did far better than expected. It wasn't as good as my Garmin watch and its average HR was usually 1–2 bpm below the correct levels, but it was surprisingly decent for step count and good enough for distance thanks to its dual-band GPS.</p><p>Our hope is that whatever behind-the-scenes tweaks OnePlus gave the Watch 2R will be applied to the Watch 3, and it won't be quite so useless when it comes to your workout data. But that's just the start of what OnePlus needs to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CRunS2KLPNbHnYmoMCwryQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRunS2KLPNbHnYmoMCwryQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to Apple, Samsung, and Google, OnePlus doesn't offer certain mainline health features like an ECG for active AFib detection or passive tracking of irregular heart rhythm throughout the day. You don't get skin temperature readings for sleep quality or health warnings, nor menstrual cycle tracking (a fairly common feature across most watch brands). Nor is there any kind of fall detection feature.</p><p>It's also fair to call out the companion OHealth app, which is quite basic compared to Fitbit or Samsung Health. The data collected is shown in a pleasing and straightforward way, but you won't find an energy score, training load, sample workouts, health reports, food/ water logging, or any number of other essentials you take for granted with other watches. Exporting to Strava or using Health Connect is usually the best option.</p><p>If OnePlus wants to compete with the big-name brands, it needs to offer more value to its fitness-focused or health-conscious customers, or else make a deal with Google to make Fitbit the default.</p>
<h2 id="hoping-for-more-than-an-iterative-update-2">Hoping for more than an iterative update</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 watch face highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other small OnePlus Watch 3 requests like LTE support, a DC dimming option for the display for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive people</a>, a much higher max brightness (the Watch 2 and 2R hit 600 and 1,000 nits, respectively), and more interesting default watch faces.</p><p>But the real question comes down to what processor the OnePlus Watch 3 uses. I suspect it'll be the Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1, same as other recent watches like the Pixel Watch 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>. So it's a shame OnePlus couldn't have waited, since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">next Snapdragon chip is due in mid-2025</a> and could deliver far better performance and efficiency.</p><p>We gave the OnePlus Watch 2 a pass on a lot of things because it was the first Wear OS watch and did a fantastic job in key areas like battery life. But we'll be much harder on the Watch 3 if it can't catch up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> for <em>most</em> of the requests above.</p>
