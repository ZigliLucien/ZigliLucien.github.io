Microsoft recognized the ongoing disruption and expected a quick fix; however, it&apos;s up to CrowdStrike to fully resolve the issue.</p><p>President & CEO CrowdStrike George Kurtz posted on X, stating that CrowdStrike was working with customers impacted by the outage and apologized for the disruption.</p><p>"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on," Kurtz said.</p><p>For now, the update has been pulled, and the company has posted a temporary fix for this outage, which will boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>

First, Google posted a quick teaser on X, giving us a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> in a champagne gold-like color. The device appears glossy, with rounded edges and a matte finish on its back panel. The tweet stated that the phone "is built for the Gemini era—" emphasizing the fact that its new device will be bolstered with AI.</p><p>Within hours of showing us what the Pro looked like, Google released a new video of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, putting all the rumors to rest and confirming the design and name of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">foldable Android smartphone</a>. The company showed off the phone&apos;s external display and its hinge mechanism when the phone is opened—and the rear camera module is set in a unique, rounded rectangular casing.</p><p>The teaser doesn&apos;t show the rumored top-right corner hole-punch front camera, which has left everyone speculating about where the phone&apos;s selfie camera will be placed. The Pixel Pro Fold comes in a sleek porcelain finish, which could come in multiple colorways.</p><p>We&apos;re hoping to see just surprise drops leading up to the Made by Google event set to take place on August 13 at 1 p.m. ET. </p>

The device comes loaded with the  AI Toolbox, which helps users accelerate their workflows. The device comes with a large 9,510mAh battery and a flash charging tech that recharges the device within 81 minutes.  The sleek 6.49mm and 584g pad features a Nimbus Gray all-metal body. It comes with add-on accessories like the OnePlus Stylo 2 and the OnePlus Pad 2 Smart Keyboard.</p><p>Now coming to the Watch 2R— it features an "ergonomic" design with two physical buttons on the side of its face, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>. One button will quickly navigate to the user&apos;s stored watch apps, while the other is an "action" button for fitness tracking. The two-toned design theme, with its bezels, gives the device a classic wristwatch appeal. With a 500mAh battery, the wearable is said to deliver up to 100 hours of charge with regular use and comes with a 7.5W VOOC fast charger, which fully charges the device in 60 minutes. The watch is priced at $229 and comes in Forest Green and Gunmetal Gray colorways.</p><p>Lastly, the company also launched the Nord Buds 3 Pro, which comes with studio-grade audio with powerful bass tones and BassWave 2.0 technology. OnePlus stated that the earbuds "come with scenario-based Smart Noise Cancellation, which intelligently detects ambient sounds and selects the most suitable noise reduction mode in real-time to balance noise-canceling effectiveness and convenience." These affordable Buds have triple microphones that promise clear and stable audio while taking voice/video calls.  The new buds come in a pebble-shaped vertical case, which sports a matte finish with some metallic accents. They come in two colorways: Starry Black and Soft Jade.</p>

The tipster continued to say that the company wants to "redraw" the app icons users experience while swiping the screen.</p><p>It also looks like the company is planning on a changed icon style and drop-down menu, which will potentially give the UI a new look. On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1813206116282867833" target="_blank">TheOneCID</a> suggests that Samsung could take a few design clues from iOS 18, some of which seem to refer to a completely revamped control center, similar to what Ice Universe alleged on Weibo.</p><p>Back in May, reports suggested that Samsung might&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">started internally testing</a> its Android 15 skin on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a>.

<p>While I think the overall blame must be laid at Microsoft&apos;s feet, the Redmond giant didn&apos;t cause this outage. An optional third-party Windows component from CrowdStrike—another Windows Security vendor—sent out an update that crashed the low-level systems of the affected computers and sent them into the famous Windows blue screen. The only thing Microsoft did wrong was build a system that allows this to happen, but this is also the most important part of what happened. </p><p>That should also be your biggest takeaway from this because the next time it happens—and there will be a next time—you could be affected, and it could be much worse. CrowdStrike may have caused this, but it was Microsoft&apos;s fault.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-cloudstrike-factor-into-all-of-this-2">How does CloudStrike factor into all of this?</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s talk a little more about what CrowdStrike is and why so many big companies use their products. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-us/">the company&apos;s website</a>, CrowdStrike has "redefined security", securing "the most critical areas of risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data." I am definitely not a Windows security professional but I can recognize a sales pitch when I see one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664" name="windows-blue-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A blue screen of death on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure the software offers an important service. I&apos;m equally sure that the decision to use what CrowdStrike offers is financially based as much or more than it is technically. Salesmen exist because they are good at selling a good or service and if the service is legitimate, it&apos;s a lot easier to do.</p>
<p>I have no problem with an entrepreneur finding a way to get the corporate world to buy into their product. I do find two things very concerning here.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, if CrowdStrike offers something so important, why is it not already a part of Windows Server? Microsoft is one of the biggest, and dare I say best, software companies in the world. If there is a legitimate need for a product like the ones CrowdStrike offers, Microsoft could provide it themselves. With Windows Server licensing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/FmEEbV4weBh2TVwpHWhhP7">being so expensive</a>, it probably <em>should</em> be provided.</p><p>My next concern is how an optional piece of software can get such low-level OS access and cripple a machine if it&apos;s corrupt or misconfigured. Microsoft should never allow software from another company to hijack its operating system this way.</p><p>This is why I&apos;ll place the blame for this particular outage on Microsoft even though the company did nothing to directly cause it. I&apos;m always going to hold the best companies to higher standards.</p>
<p>Neither of these ideas is crazy or new. I guarantee that engineers at Microsoft knew this could happen, looked at how it could be prevented, and analyzed what the company needed to do to "fix" them. It&apos;s trendy to hate on the company, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/using-android-microsoft-ecosystem">Microsoft is one of the best companies in the world</a> when it comes to computing, both at the edge and in the cloud. Even if you&apos;re not a fan of its products, you can easily see this. Critical infrastructure depends on Microsoft because it is so good at what it does.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-next-time-2">What about next time?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws" name="bricked-bootloader.jpg" alt="Things can go wrong when rooting your phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rSghSmvzrWK6wGm2qxNws.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Enough with the amateur analysis, though. This is all concerning because we got off easy this time. Yes, your flight got canceled if you were traveling today, and maybe you had no cell service on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your new phone</a> for a few hours this morning. If you were lucky, you got to slack off instead of work at your office this morning. If you&apos;re unlucky, you get to spend the weekend repairing the damage the outage caused to your IT department.</p>
<p>What if, the next time, the national power grid goes down? Imagine an entire country in the dark for an extended amount of time because of a misconfigured kernel module from a third-party vendor. I know there are multiple fail-safes in place to prevent anything like this, but you should never say never. </p><p>More realistically, what if the next global outage affects mobile devices? Forget the inconvenience of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-not-just-you-gmail-youtube-and-other-google-services-are-down-right-now">Gmail</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158595/imessage-down-outage-iphone-apple-text-messages">iMessage</a> going down and instead imagine every Android or iPhone or Surface laptop crapping out for a few hours. It&apos;s easy to say it would be an opportunity to go outside and get some much-needed fresh air, but billions and billions of dollars would be lost, and entire companies would go bankrupt because of it.</p>
<p>I&apos;m certain that incidents like what happened this week are great educational tools and help prevent a more serious incident from happening. I hope the right people—the ones who control the purse strings—use them as a learning opportunity.</p>

Unfortunately, Google Maps is so ubiquitous that its recommendations can <em>cause</em> traffic-filled nightmares just as often as they help people escape them. </p><p>A few weeks back, I had a tech demo at Logitech&apos;s offices in North San Jose, which I scheduled early to beat the rush. I left at 1 pm with 50 miles and a little over an hour to get home. As I took off, I saw a warning about an accident on 680N, so I turned on an audiobook and got ready for a brief slowdown.</p><p>It took two and a half hours to make it back. I had traveled from 680 to 238 to 84, then onto surface streets for over ten miles, then to 580, 13, 24, and finally back to 680 before coming to my exit. <strong>Seven</strong> different highways (if you count 680 twice) full to the brim with rerouted Google Maps users.</p><p>Here&apos;s what happened. As I drove up 680, Google Maps warned me that the accident had caused a fifteen-minute slowdown and that exiting up ahead would save time. Since I didn&apos;t have anyone there to check Google&apos;s new route, I trusted the app&apos;s advice and exited. </p><p>So did everyone else, it turns out! The siren call of a "Faster route available" sent thousands of drivers onto a two-lane street with only one exit lane for a turn two miles down the road. Everyone crammed into that lane while all the drivers unfamiliar with this new route frantically cut in line miles ahead, causing a huge slowdown. After about 20 minutes to drive a couple of miles, Maps rerouted me again.</p><p>I won&apos;t bore you with a long, drawn-out description of a long, drawn-out drive. Suffice it to say that I very much regretted taking Google Maps&apos; advice instead of just sticking it out on the direct route. That would have probably saved me an extra hour of needless zig-zagging across the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Every friend or family member I&apos;ve asked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>&apos; "faster route available" had an immediate traffic horror story to share, where the app sent them on some obscure side-street route to avoid gridlock on a highway or expressway, only for things to slow to a crawl because a ton of other drivers took the exact same route on a road not designed for heavy use. I&apos;ve also seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1dr08ef/google_maps_rerouting_is_awful/">r/Google Maps</a> posts complaining about this.</p><p>Other times, people will carefully choose a specific route for a road trip or long haul with better scenery, more EV stations or rest stops, or better conditions for driving a large truck or RV — only for Google Maps to auto-reroute them to something "faster" unless you cancel the switch quickly enough. I&apos;ve found several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/161fw2d/google_maps_absolutely_needs_a_setting_to_turn/">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/15y4ger/how_to_stop_google_from_changing_to_fastest_route/">posts</a> criticizing this very issue, with people suggesting tricks like adding extra stops just to prevent auto-rerouting.</p><p>Google Maps occasionally suggests that I "exit hop" or "freeway jump" in congested traffic, meaning I take an exit but stay in the left lane and reenter the freeway a mile ahead. It&apos;s a jerk move that only slows traffic down in the long run, but it&apos;s never clear that&apos;s what you&apos;re agreeing to do when Maps reroutes you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UVfa6JdcPQx4Udmx3pLhHN" name="google-maps-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-landscape.jpg" alt="Google Maps on Galaxy Z Flip" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UVfa6JdcPQx4Udmx3pLhHN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My main problem is that Google Maps&apos; algorithm doesn&apos;t seem to account for its own power to change the flow of traffic based on its wide reach. According to a MarketWatch study, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-popularity-united-states-study">70% of U.S. drivers use Google Maps</a> despite iPhones&apos; popularity here. So by observing that a road is empty, Maps changes that reality and shifts a ton of traffic to that new road, even though it ultimately won&apos;t be much faster for the <del>lemmings</del> drivers following its advice.</p><p>I emailed a Google Maps contact and asked them about the algorithm. Does it account for current traffic levels or a road&apos;s maximum capacity when it recommends a faster route? Are they aware of the drawbacks of the "faster route available" system—its engineers live in California, after all—and will Google&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> pivot lead to better recs down the line? As of yet, I haven&apos;t heard back.</p><p>Anecdotally, most of the people I&apos;ve asked about this say that they don&apos;t let Maps reroute them anymore. They choose a route when they leave, and if it slows down, they stick to the current route because they don&apos;t trust mid-route changes to pay off. Despite Google Maps&apos; smart reputation, this is one area where people have lost or are losing faith. </p><p>Many of Google&apos;s recent Maps updates have focused on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">UI overhaul</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-details-gen-ai-search-maps">GenAI recommendations on where to go</a>. But rather than have Maps telling me about "places with a vintage vibe in SF," I&apos;d rather it focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>In my mind, Google Maps needs the "with great power comes great responsibility" talk. Sending a simultaneous signal to every Google Maps driver to converge on some backroad detour is a recipe for bottlenecks and further accidents. If Google can figure out how to be more prudent with its "Faster route available" recommendations, that&apos;ll make everyone safer and happier.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, one of two new foldable phone models launched by Samsung at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked event in July 2024</a>, can be charged in a number of ways. Along with wired charging at 25W via USB-C using a compatible cable and charger, it can also charge wirelessly. </p><p>The phone charges wirelessly at 15W, which is pretty much the industry standard rate. Thus, it can’t be charged as quickly as competing phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a>, which can charge wirelessly at a rapid 50W using a compatible AIRVOOC charger. However, it will do the trick. </p><p>It works with any wireless charging pad, stand, or surface, so go ahead and plop it down or atop one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">the best wireless chargers</a> to get a battery boost. Given the speed, don’t expect to be up and running quickly. But you can keep the phone on a wireless charging pad on your desk while you work through the day, for example, or give it a boost on a wireless charging surface at the airport before your flight. </p><p>Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers 4.5W reverse charging, which can be used to recharge other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">Samsung Galaxy Buds</a> or Galaxy smartwatch. As the name implies, it takes battery power from the phone and uses it to charge other devices, effectively functioning as its own charging pad. </p><p>Naturally, using reverse charging will drain your phone’s battery. But if you need to give your earbuds a quick boost to be able to listen to tunes or a podcast on the way home from work or school and your phone’s battery is full, this could be worth it for the top-up. Given the slow rate, however, this is something you’ll probably only use for emergencies and quick recharges to get you through a commute or to make a phone call. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that even with wired charging, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn’t charge very quickly, either. It only charges at a rate of 25W, which is much slower than many other phones, including Samsung’s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> non-foldable device. </p><p>Bottom line: make sure to keep this phone juiced up at all times, and invest in one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">the best portable battery packs</a> to bring along with you if you’re a power user.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 might be an advanced, premium foldable phone, but it lacks fast charging. While it does support wireless charging, the rate is pretty slow. The same goes for wired charging. It also works with reverse charging, however, so you can recharge compatible buds, smartwatches, and more. If you plan to use this phone a lot, invest in a portable charging bank.</p></p>

This means you can safely wash dishes, have a shower, go for a quick dip in the water, or run in the rain with it on. But as with any water-resistant device, you should always take precautions.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-water-resistant-rating-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 water-resistant rating?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> boasts both an IP68 and 5ATM water-resistance rating. The IP68 rating means that you can submerge the watch in up to a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. You could theoretically swim with it as well, as long as you aren&apos;t diving deep or staying submerged for a period longer than half an hour. </p><p>The 5ATM rating, meanwhile, refers to the pressure the watch can withstand. With this rating, the watch can withstand pressure up to a depth of 50 meters. So, it’s OK for swimming in a pool or at the lake, showering, relaxing in the bathtub, or light water or snow activities. But it isn’t for more intense water or snow activities. </p><p>Note that water-resistant ratings apply at the time of manufacture. This degrades over time so as with any other smartwatch (or other electronic device, for that matter) that has an IP68 or 5ATM rating, it will become more susceptible to water damage as it gets older. </p><p>What’s more, the rating relates to freshwater sources, so if you’re swimming in a heavily chlorinated pool, for example, or saltwater ocean, you might want to remove the watch to prevent damage, or invest in a waterproof casing for an added layer of protection. This rating also does not withstand high pressures of water, like while water skiing, nor high temperatures, like in a hot tub. Use your best judgement. </p><p>If you are swimming or doing outdoor activities in the rain or snow with the watch, make sure you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">water-resistant band</a>.  </p><p>If you want something with a higher water-resistance rating and that’s more durable overall, you can consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead, which offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-waterproof">rating twice as high at 10ATM</a>. Otherwise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is just like any other premium smartwatch, and you can wear it with confidence just about anywhere. Just wear with caution when swimming, make sure to thoroughly rinse and dry it when you&apos;re done, and you&apos;re good to go!</p>

<p>As the latest Samsung Galaxy smartwatch in the line, the Galaxy Watch 7 boasts some enticing upgrades like an improved chip, dual-band GPS, and Sleep Apnea detection. It has the same IP68 and 5TAM rating, protecting it against both water and dust. But, like most other smartwatches, it isn’t completely waterproof. If you need something more serious in this department, consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra instead.  </p></p>

<ul><li>The Meta Quest 4 and Quest 4s are coming in 2026, according to one report.</li><li>The Meta Quest Pro 2 will debut in 2027, confirming earlier reports on the pro-level headset sequel.</li><li>Meta is said to be cutting R&D costs for Reality Labs by 20% by 2026.</li></ul>
<p>While the Meta Quest 3 is only just about to celebrate its first birthday, a new report suggests that its successor will be headed to market in just two years from now. What&apos;s more, Meta is reportedly looking to release a Meta Quest 4s at the same time, debuting a premium and budget line at the same time.</p><p>That&apos;s opposed to Meta&apos;s current strategy, as the company is rumored to be debuting a budget-minded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> this Fall. The report comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/reality-comes-to-metas-reality-labs">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-4-2026-quest-pro-2-2027-report/">UploadVR</a>) and is written by Wayne Ma and Kalley Huang. Ma has reported on several Meta leaks in the past that turned out to be true, which means there&apos;s a high likelihood of this report being quite accurate.</p><p>Releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> when the Quest 3 is just three years old might seem like a fast timeframe — especially if you&apos;re a console gamer who is used to 6-8 years between major Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo releases — but it falls right in line with the length of time between the Quest 2 and Quest 3&apos;s release.</p><p>The report also says that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> headset is still in the works for a 2027 release despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lg-made-meta-quest-pro-2-canceled">recent cancellation</a> of an LG-made prototype. Quest Pro 2 rumors have been all over the place recently, so it might be wise to take this one with a grain of salt.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A new pair of AR glasses and the Meta Quest 3s are supposed to debut this Fall, while the Quest 4 and Quest 4s are reported to appear in two years.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta is also said to start cutting Reality Labs&apos; budget by 20% between this year and 2026. Reality Labs is the group within Meta that&apos;s responsible for products like the Meta Quest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama AI</a> and other behind-the-scenes developments.</p><p>Reality Labs has earned a reputation for spending lots of money despite churning out several successful products lately, including the Meta Quest line and the aforementioned Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Most recently, Reality Labs pulled in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">30% more revenue</a> than in previous quarters, showing continued growth in Quest headset sales and the VR market, as a whole.</p><p>Meta is said to be debuting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">new pair of AR glasses</a> this Fall in addition to the Meta Quest 3s. The launch of more products gives Reality Labs a chance to increase its revenue further and, combined with lower R&D spending, could be the way Meta finally makes the infamous division profitable.</p>

<ul><li>After the launch of Android 15 Beta 4, a dive into the code unearthed Google's potential to charge users for its Pixel "Satellite SOS" services.</li><li>Strings in the code suggest the first two years of use will arrive free of charge for users, but an unknown amount may be brought forward afterward.</li><li>Google rolled out Android 15 Beta 4 to enrolled testers on July 18 and brought with it a better emoji experience and resource allocation for apps.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve heard of Google developing a "Satellite OS" for Pixels for a while now, but a discovery shows it might cost you.</p><p>With enrolled testers getting their hands on Android 15&apos;s latest beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-satellite-sos-free-apk-teardown-3462798/">Android Authority</a> discovered something interesting about Pixel&apos;s SOS feature. Through an APK dive, it was seen that Google might charge users for its Satellite OS services after a brief free period.</p><p>A string in the code states, "Satellite SOS is included at no charge for two years." It seems that Google is eyeing an approach similar to Apple and its emergency services, which are also free for the initial two years.</p><p>Other information in the code details the Pixel Satellite SOS feature more by stating, "your name, email, phone number, location, device information, and emergency contact information" will be shared with 911. That data is given to satellite service providers, as well.</p><p>One final sentence within Android 15&apos;s code mentions updating your Pixel to receive support for the SOS function. This is an occurrence older Pixels, like the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, will likely see as the emergency service is coming with Android 15. By extension, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-official-teaser-gemini">Pixel 9 series</a> should have it ready and waiting.</p><p>Concrete information regarding <em>how much </em>Google intends to charge (if it does) for its SOS service is unknown.</p>

<p>The past few Android 15 betas have held informative insights into what Google has planned for its SOS feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-satellite-sos-ui-spotted">such as its UI</a>. Early walkthroughs were discovered, showing that users will be prompted to gain a "clear view of the sky" before activating their SOS services. Users will then need to locate the appropriate satellite through the on-display animation.</p><p>Users can retain text-based contact with their family and 911 services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">after enabling the emergency SOS feature</a> within the settings.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">Android 15 Beta 4</a> was released for enrolled testers yesterday (July 18) and pushes us ever closer to a full OS launch. One of its key changes was a switch from PNG-based emoji fonts to a vector format. Technically speaking, this ensures your emojis scale in size without sacrificing quality and becoming distorted or blurred.</p><p>Android 15&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> were in the spotlight once again alongside better app activity management. It seems the software can better allocate its resources to keep apps active only when prompted by the user.</p>

<h2 id="here-apos-s-what-you-should-know-about-the-water-and-dust-resistance-of-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Here&apos;s what you should know about the water (and dust) resistance of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</h2>
<p>Being the company&apos;s newest flagship foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> packs a laundry list of features, including everything from top-tier hardware specifications to AI-backed software smarts. It&apos;s a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> that you&apos;d want to take with you everywhere, and the good news is that you certainly can, without having to worry (too much) about it getting damaged.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable smartphones</a> are complicated and intricately designed gadgets that need to be protected well from the elements if they are to keep working. That&apos;s why it&apos;s great that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is backed by an IP48 rating. This rating means that this thing can survive being submerged in up to 1.5 meters (approximately 5 feet) of water for around 30 minutes.</p><p>While that&apos;s reassuring, it&apos;s important to know that the above-mentioned rating only holds true for fresh water. This means that most natural water bodies (which usually have salt water) and swimming pools (which generally have chlorinated water) aren&apos;t recommended. You should also ensure to keep other liquids (e.g., oils, beverages) away from the smartphone. In case that does happen, make sure you immediately turn off the device and try to wipe/clean as much liquid as possible with a clean microfiber cloth. Once you do that, we suggest heading to your nearest Samsung authorized service center, as they know how to handle these situations the best.</p>

<p>The IP48 certification is a big step up if you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. the Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, as the latter only comes with an IPX8 rating. This means that in addition to fresh water, Samsung&apos;s latest foldable is protected against solid particles (more than 1mm in size) as well.</p><p>Even though it&apos;s just launched, we&apos;re sure the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will end up being one of the best foldable phones available out there. It&apos;s thinner and lighter despite having improved ingress protection and better durability. However, you can never be too careful with a smartphone this expensive, which is why we recommend getting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases" target="_blank">proper case</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screen-protectors" target="_blank">good screen protector</a> as soon as you get the device.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reports that it achieved 910,000 foldable units pre-ordered in South Korea, much smaller than its record-shattering number in 2023.</li><li>Pre-orders dropped by 10% with the Flip 6 making up 60% of the total and the Fold 6 rising to 40%.</li><li>Samsung's TM Roh informed reporters shortly after Unpacked that the company hopes to grow its foldable sales by 10% this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early numbers indicate that Samsung&apos;s 2024 line of foldables isn&apos;t as popular when compared to the numbers achieved last year.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240719050428&ACE_SEARCH=1">The Korea Herald</a>, Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have reached a pre-order peak much lower than last year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_z_fold6_galaxy_z_flip6_south_korea_pre_order_numbers-news-63779.php">GSMArena</a>). The company reported 910,000 unit pre-orders for its foldable phones in South Korea. This reportedly marks a 10% decline in Galaxy foldable interest this year.</p><p>The Flip 6 makes up 60%, leaving the Fold 6 to pick up the remainder of the pre-order totals. The publication states this marks a 10% growth for the larger, book-style foldable.</p><p>However, everything isn&apos;t sour, as Samsung reported that it made gains with younger consumers. Numbers indicate that the company has done well in attracting consumers in their 20s to 30s, which the post states is Samsung&apos;s "target audience." Consumers within that age range make up "more than half" of the foldable pre-order numbers in 2024.</p><p>You might remember last year when Samsung boasted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">record-shattering pre-order numbers</a> for the Flip 5 and Fold 5 in South Korea. The totals defied their expectations, reaching 1.02 million pre-ordered units. That number beat its previously held record of 970,000 units, which 2024&apos;s total misses by 60,000 devices.</p><p>The Flip 5 amounted to a whopping 70% of the sales, while its book-style partner achieved 30% in 2023.</p><p>Shortly after Unpacked, Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh, spoke with reporters and offered insight into the hope <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">surrounding its foldable sales</a>. Roh stated that Samsung wanted to grow its foldable sales by 10% following AI advancements with its Flip 6 and Fold 6. However, the company had quite a lackluster reveal of its new foldable line this year, showing that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/with-its-latest-foldables-samsung-proves-that-it-cant-innovate">its innovation has hit a snag</a>.</p><p>Neither device offers any notable or worthwhile hardware upgrades when compared to 2023. Moreover, both phones picked up an unsavory $100 increase.</p>

<p>We&apos;re entering peak launch season in the tech world, where there&apos;s something new right around the corner almost every other week. Samsung just kicked things off with the launch of the updated Galaxy Watch 7, along with a slew of other products. The new model promises more accurate health and wellness tracking, the latest software, and a more fluid usage experience. It&apos;s also priced the same as last year&apos;s model. </p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2, which launched earlier this year, is also priced the same and has a similar design and features. Its unique dual-identity for the processor and software helps it achieve incredible efficiency, which shows in the battery life. If you&apos;re looking at getting a new watch or thinking of upgrading, which one of these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> should you pick?</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-oneplus-watch-2-design-xa0-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. OnePlus Watch 2: Design </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> and OnePlus Watch 2 have similar designs, with large circular dials, two physical buttons, and a traditional buckle-style clasp on the strap. The Watch 2 has a stainless steel chassis and only comes in a single 46mm size. This is a bit of a letdown, especially since those with smaller wrists might find it too large. </p><p>It&apos;s also on the heavier side, weighing 80g with the straps. It comes in two combos: Radiant Steel with a green rubber strap or Black Steel with a black rubber strap. OnePlus sells additional bands, or you can pick from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-watch-2-bands">best Watch 2 bands</a> from other manufacturers. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6N2L9X9Q8U5PiMqQCXTmJm" name="oneplus-watch-2-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 side buttons on red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6N2L9X9Q8U5PiMqQCXTmJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> is great. The 1.43-inch AMOLED panel has a high resolution and good brightness, and we didn&apos;t face any outdoor legibility issues when we tested it. It also has 2.5D sapphire crystal glass for better durability. The physical buttons on the watch have an asymmetrical design, which is said to have been inspired by vintage cars. </p><p>The rotating crown on the Watch 2 gives it a cool analog feel, but it&apos;s not functional, sadly. The second, more recessed button can be used to launch workouts or be programmed to do other things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 comes in two sizes—40mm and 44mm—and each weighs 28.8g and 33.8g, respectively. Thanks to the aluminum frame, it&apos;s much lighter than the OnePlus Watch 2. The two sizes should also appeal to a wider audience. The larger variant comes in Green and Silver, while the smaller one is available in Green and Cream. </p><p>Samsung offers more options for watch straps with the Watch 7, including two sizes. You can choose between Fabric, Sport, or Athleisure options, and each type comes in multiple colors.  You can take this customization one step further with Watch Design Studio, which has even more colors to choose from. Finally, you get LTE or cellular options for both sizes, too. </p>

<p>Folks with smaller wrists will prefer the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7. It has a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display, color always-on mode, and sapphire crystal for scratch protection. The 44mm version has all the same features but a larger 1.5-inch AMOLED screen and a higher resolution. </p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 has a unique combination of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> SoC and a BES2700BP chipset. The former powers Wear OS 4 tasks, while the latter handles the low-power RTOS and all the sensors. In our experience, the interface is fluid, and you never really notice the switch between the two chipsets. The Watch 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">has been promised two Wear OS updates</a>, so it should be getting Wear OS 5, although OnePlus hasn&apos;t said when. </p><p>When we reviewed it, the software was very buggy. We faced issues receiving timely notifications, getting the DND mode to work, and when Sleep mode refused to engage. OnePlus did roll out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-watch-2-gets-relax-and-barometer-apps-with-new-update" target="_blank">big update</a> for the Watch 2 in May, which added two new apps and included bug fixes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vqm2SLjkKdMi7tqCdFodJR" name="oneplus-watch-2-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 DND mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vqm2SLjkKdMi7tqCdFodJR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 supports dual-frequency GPS for more accurate positioning when using it outdoors. There&apos;s also dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5 LE, and NFC. All the usual health tracking sensors are present, like an optical heart rate sensor, SpO2 monitoring, a geomagnetic sensor, and a barometer. There&apos;s no support for taking an ECG, though, which is a big miss. Apart from the accurate GPS, we didn&apos;t have the best experience with health tracking. The Watch 2 was consistently off, whether it was tracking calories burnt, sleep, or even stress. </p><p>Battery life is where the OnePlus Watch 2 really shines. It&apos;s rated to last 100 hours on one charge, which is more than four days. We managed to run it for just under three days with the always-on mode, which is still amazing and better than most other watches. Using the power saver mode, you should be able to get up to 12 days of use, and you can still receive notifications in this mode. The Watch 2 can be charged from empty to full in just over an hour, thanks to the 7.5W VOOC charging. </p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 features a new Exynos W1000 (3nm) SoC, which Samsung claims has a 3x faster CPU and 30% better power efficiency than the previous model. There&apos;s 32GB of storage this time, which is double what you got on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. The Watch 7 has an impressive set of health and wellness monitoring features. Along with everything the OnePlus Watch 2 tracks, it can also detect irregular heart rhythm (AFib), blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG), and more. </p><p>The Watch 7 runs on One UI 6 Watch, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, making it the first smartwatch to ship with Google&apos;s latest wearable software. It has a long list of fitness and activity tracking, Galaxy AI integration for more nuanced auto-generated replies, and double-pinch gestures for touchless interaction with your watch.  </p>

<p>A 425mAh battery is the largest you can get on the Galaxy Watch 7 (44mm). The smaller model has a 300mAh battery. It&apos;ll probably be tough to compete with the OnePlus Watch 2 here, which has a much larger 500mAh battery, but you should expect a respectable full day to even slightly more with the 40mm model. We&apos;ll know for certain once we&apos;ve tested it. </p><p>The Watch 7 has a slightly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-support-wireless-charging">different charging system</a> due to changes to the sensors and glass on the bottom of the watch. Samsung recommends using only the charger that comes with the watch, as it&apos;s not compatible with older Galaxy Watch chargers. The ability to charge it via a phone&apos;s reverse wireless charging feature is also not supported anymore.  </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 would be my recommendation between the two watches. It&apos;s priced well, has good first-party customization options, and the wealth of activity and wellness tracking is commendable. It also comes in multiple sizes, and you can opt for a cellular version if you need it. Even though we&apos;re yet to test it, we have no doubt that it&apos;ll soon end up on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watch</a> list. </p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 is a good option if you want the best battery life at this price point. It&apos;s also highly durable, looks very classy, and often retails for around $250. Health tracking wasn&apos;t the most accurate when we tested it, but this could all change with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-launch">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>. The watch features small tweaks to the current design and (hopefully) better sensors, so it could be one to consider.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 offers incredible battery life and is good value at its current discounted price. But with the 2R around the corner promising all-round improvements, it's best to hold off if you can. </p></p>
