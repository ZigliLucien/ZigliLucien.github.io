<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Wireless power sharing, known as PowerShare, used to be a handy feature on Samsung smartwatches for quick charges.</li><li>However, Samsung removed this feature in its latest Galaxy Watch lineup due to a new sensor design, which increased the distance between the internal charging coil and the charging surface.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch 7 series makes up for it with improved health monitoring, thanks to the new BioActive sensor array that tracks Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Samsung has different priorities now. The South Korean tech giant&apos;s newest Galaxy Watch series has dropped wireless charging from compatible smartphones.</p><p>In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ae/support/mobile-devices/about-the-galaxy-watch7-series-wireless-charging-and-wireless-power-sharing-features/" target="_blank">support page</a> update, Samsung admitted a shift from its previous Galaxy Watch models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Watch 7 Ultra</a> do not support wireless charging from a paired Galaxy phone. X user Jordy Verboven was the first to notice this omission (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-say-goodbye-to-wireless-powershare/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... the #GalaxyWatch7 no longer supports wireless powershare https://t.co/RhOom0aorm<a href="https://twitter.com/JordyV27/status/1811338879900770361">July 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, some smartphones have a feature called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-wireless-power-share-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">wireless power sharing</a> that lets the phone&apos;s battery wirelessly charge compatible smartwatches just by placing them close together.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s version of this is called PowerShare, and it has been available on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">beloved Samsung smartwatches</a>, except for the latest models. While not a common feature, it was super handy for a quick charge when you needed it.</p><p>According to the support page, Samsung had to remove this feature due to a design change. The new sensor array required reshaping the rear glass on both Watch models. This change increased the distance between the internal wireless charging coil and the external charging surface, making the previous wireless power-sharing capability impossible.</p><p>Even without wireless power sharing, the Galaxy Watch 7 is a big leap in health monitoring. The new BioActive sensor array is more accurate and provides more detailed health metrics than before, as per Samsung. Notably, it can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">track Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)</a>, giving users valuable insights into their metabolic health.</p><p>Previous Galaxy Watch models consistently featured wireless charging via Samsung&apos;s PowerShare technology. Therefore, the noticeable absence of this feature in the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra comes as a bit of a surprise.</p><p>The new sensor design also means you have to use the charger that ships with the Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra for the best results. Using older Galaxy Watch chargers can slow down charging and make the device overheat. So, Samsung suggests sticking with the included charger.</p>

<ul><li>The Amazfit Helio ring could be launched in India soon, likely during Prime Day sales. </li><li>The ring is made from Titanium alloy, comes in two sizes, and is expected to be priced at around 25,000 INR.</li><li>The smart ring is equipped with features like heart rate, SpO2, monitoring, and stress tracking that are integrated into the Zepp app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rings as wearables have become increasingly popular in recent months, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy ring </a>officially launched, several other companies have started to up their game and come up with strategies to expand their markets worldwide. </p><p>In May, Amazfit’s first smart ring, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-lands-in-us">Helio Ring</a>, was launched in the U.S. Now, according to Smartprix, it is making its way to India. SmartPrix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/amazfit-helio-smart-ring-to-debut-during-prime-day-sale-product-listing-spotted-on-amazon/">spotted</a> a detailed product listing of the Helio Ring on Amazon India’s website, and everything seemed similar to the U.S. product listing. </p><p>The listing states that the Helio Ring will feature a Titanium Alloy textured exterior, weigh around 4gm, and measure 2.6mm in thickness. It will be available in two sizes only: 10 and 12. </p><p>The smart ring is equipped with features like heart rate, SpO2 monitoring, and stress tracking. It further includes in-depth sleep monitoring, mental and physical readiness analysis, and sports data tracking. The screenshot gives information about the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="v6MnPhj4CK3mRJEbvybgYY" name="Amaze-fit-helio-amazon-india.jpg" alt="Amazfit Helio Amazon India listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6MnPhj4CK3mRJEbvybgYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the U.S. listing, we know that the size 10 smart ring will have an 18.5mAh battery, and the size 12 model has a 20.5mAh one. Both take approximately two hours to charge fully, and the ring is said to last for about four days. It also comes with a charger and an out-of-the-box instruction manual.</p><p>While most details seem to have been listed, the price remained missing. We assume that since the ring costs around $299.99 in the U.S., it will come at a similar price range for the Indian market as well, which could be around 25,000 INR.</p><p>When we checked on our end, the listing was taken down and didn&apos;t show up on Amazon&apos;s India site. However, according to another website, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/amazfit-helio-ring-india-launch-prime-day-report/">91Mobiles</a>, the smart ring will likely be launched during the massive Prime Days sale that is set to occur this month in India, likely on July 20.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-nas-should-i-buy-xa0-2">Which NAS should I buy? </h2>
<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you&apos;re going to need. That sets the basis for whether you should get a two-bay, four-bay, or a larger NAS server.</p><p>Synology is the largest manufacturer of NAS servers, and it sells dozens of products across various categories. Synology is known for its high-quality offerings, and its products are built to last. But the defining feature of Synology&apos;s NAS models is the software, with the web-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-manager-70">DiskStation Manager</a> setting the standard for this category.</p><p>If this is the first NAS you&apos;re buying and you don&apos;t want to invest a lot of money into a server, the Synology DiskStation DS223j is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-nas">best cheap NAS</a>. You&apos;re still getting all the best software features that Synology has to offer, and while you don&apos;t get as many drive bays as some devices, it is a great choice for those making their foray into this segment. If you don&apos;t mind spending a little extra cash, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">Synology DiskStation DS723+</a> is a great choice for most users. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-a-hard-drive-for-my-nas-xa0-2">How do I choose a hard drive for my NAS? </h2>
<p>Choosing the right hard drive for your NAS is just as vital as selecting the right enclosure. Because NAS enclosures are designed to run 24/7, there are NAS-focused hard drives available in the market. These models feature vibration resistance and are designed to handle the stresses of a 24/7 environment, and differ from your regular hard drives.</p><p>Another factor to consider when choosing a NAS hard drive is the speed. HDDs are usually available in either 5400rpm or 7200rpm, and the latter delivers better performance because the spindle moves at 7,200 rounds per minute. I&apos;ve used 5400rpm drives in NAS enclosures tailored for media streaming for years without any issues, but if you&apos;re building a more enthusiast-focused NAS and are looking for better performance, pick a model with a 7200rpm. </p><p>There are several NAS-focused hard drive product lines, with WD Red Plus and Seagate IronWolf dominating the sales charts. With drives starting out at 1TB and going all the way to 20TB, there&apos;s no shortage of options available across either product line. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-prime-day-2">When is Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, the 10th annual Prime Day shopping event is scheduled to begin on July 16th and run through the 17th. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day?</h2>
<p>Yep, the vast majority of Prime Day deals will only be available to Prime subscribers. If you&apos;re interested in shopping during the sale and you aren&apos;t a member just yet, we recommend taking advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can explore the benefits of Prime Day without paying a cent. Alternatively, you could just wait and see if Amazon&apos;s biggest competitors will launch rival sales that don&apos;t require a membership. </p>

<p>Long, boring flights are the bane of modern first-world existence. Between having to sit still for hours and having little to do, these kinds of flights are generally no fun. And forget about working on a plane unless you enjoy neck pain or the potential of having your laptop smashed by the reclining seat in front of you.</p><p>That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">Meta Quest 3&apos;s airplane mode</a> is such a godsend. It allows the headset to be used on a plane and it works incredibly well, as is proven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEWD19ZS5Ww">countless</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO7Gs5JgBOQ">YouTube</a> videos and other customer feedback. But I haven&apos;t been able to adequately use the feature yet for one good reason: I can&apos;t fit the headset in my luggage.</p><p>As I was packing for my trip to see Samsung&apos;s latest at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-z-fold-6-flip-6-and-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Unpacked July 2024</a>, I realized that my suitcase was quickly running out of room. For a three-day trip, I had to pack clothes, electronics, my camera, cables, and all sorts of things into a suitcase and a backpack. Once all that was packed, I had a tiny cube of space that a VR headset simply wouldn&apos;t fit into.</p><p>It&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve run into time and time again over the past few weeks since the feature debuted — I travel quite a bit for this job — and while I&apos;m still going to try to fit it into a future trip, it&apos;s clear that the size of modern VR headsets is still prohibitive to some of the things we desperately want to use them for.</p>

<p>While everyone&apos;s travel situations are different, I&apos;ve found that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">best smart glasses</a> are better travel companions because of their smaller size. While most of these glasses are quite as small as a standard pair of glasses — that&apos;s especially true of smart display glasses like my favorite pair, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/">Viture Pro</a> — they&apos;re still substantially smaller than any standalone VR headset on the market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Smart display glasses are a much better travel companion because of the size and ease of use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Smart display glasses are effectively a giant virtual monitor that rests on your face. They attach to any device that supports USB-C display output — your phone, laptop, or even the Steam Deck — giving you the ability to relax and hold your head in a natural position instead of craning your neck down the whole time.</p><p>My colleague, Andrew Myrick, recently took Xreal Air 2s on a trip with him and they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">saved him from neck pain</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La" name="meta-quest-3-travel-case-versus-viture-one-travel-case.jpg" alt="Comparing the size of the Meta Quest 3 and Viture One travel cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Meta Quest headsets don&apos;t support this feature. You either have to sideload videos onto your headset and use a 3rd party app to play them — not something that&apos;s super user-friendly — or play an offline VR game you might have installed on your headset.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If the size didn't stop me, the fact that I can't plug my laptop directly into a Quest and use it as a virtual monitor would.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There&apos;s little hope of using one for working on a plane because you&apos;d need to connect to your laptop over a Wi-Fi network, and that usually doesn&apos;t work well on a plane.</p><p>I&apos;d <em>prefer</em> to use the Quest because the field of view is significantly wider than any pair of smart glasses on the market and I generally find the Quest&apos;s design quite comfortable over time, especially when using a headstrap like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-Pro-Accessories-conditioning-hot-swappable/dp/B0CSY8PD63/">BoboVR S3 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>It also does head tracking better than any pair of smart glasses on the market, making it feel more like you actually have a TV or monitor in front physically residing in front of you. Most smart glasses pin the display to your vision, meaning it moves around with your head. That can be particularly uncomfortable when there&apos;s turbulence on a plane, as trying to follow bouncy text can cause nausea.</p><p>The ironic thing is that smart glasses are often just as expensive as a Meta Quest headset. That feels a little silly, given that the Quest is a completely standalone console and the smart glasses are <em>just</em> a monitor, but sometimes you have to pay for convenience.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest carrying cases</a> can protect your Quest while traveling, but until the headsets get a lot smaller, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be taking one on too many flights.</p>

It&apos;s yet another shift after the Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6 Classic, but we suspect Samsung will stick with a Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 next year.</p><p>After Apple cleared the way to sell smartwatches for the price of a smartphone, Samsung quickly followed suit. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a> showcases all the ways it mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. During a private Q&A session, Samsung engineers told us they&apos;re focusing on making the "most premium" watch due to "market" forces, leaving its old Pro behind.</p><p>That&apos;s why we assume the Ultra series is here to stay, and that Samsung will release a Watch Ultra 2 next year. So, what do we expect Samsung to change next year, and what do we <em>want</em> them to change? Here&apos;s our Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 wishlist.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-crown-buttons-bezel-anything-2">Add a crown, buttons, bezel...anything!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-underside.jpg" alt="The underside of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite borrowing many design decisions from the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">didn&apos;t copy Apple in one key way</a>: there&apos;s no crown. Nor did Samsung give the Watch Ultra a physical or digital rotating bezel. You can only use touchscreen swipes and buttons to navigate. </p><p>Rugged titanium watches like these aren&apos;t strictly for athletes; many people buy them for the design, battery life, and extra protection. But for anyone wanting to use the Watch Ultra&apos;s dual-band GPS or new route-racing tool, you might be disappointed by the lack of tactile options when you&apos;re mid-run with sweaty fingertips.</p><p>We don&apos;t care <em>what</em> Samsung adds to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, as long as it&apos;s some physical option. A physical bezel like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>&apos;s might make it too heavy, so Samsung could consider adding a crown like many other Android watch-makers (Google Pixel, Ticwatch) or subtle buttons on the left-hand side like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> can stick with the digital bezel to keep it lightweight, if Samsung wants.</p>

<p>Samsung gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and Ultra 13 LEDs instead of four on the Watch 6, which supposedly makes them significantly more accurate for heart rate and blood oxygen data (especially during workouts). It says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">revamped Biosensor</a> can track your body&apos;s Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index, which is a warning sign for future body health issues like diabetes and heart failure.</p><p>We love this focus on health accuracy, combined with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> launch for better sleep tracking! We&apos;ve yet to test the improved HR sensors for ourselves, but we&apos;re optimistic. So we&apos;ll simply hope that the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 continues prioritizing health.</p><p>Maybe Samsung will finally make its blood pressure data accurate enough that the FDA approves it for U.S. usage.

<p>Samsung&apos;s big fitness update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is its "Energy Score." It takes your heart rate, HRV, recent activities, and sleep quality to tell you how much energy you have for the day. It&apos;s a long-standing, popular feature on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> like Fitbit (Daily Readiness Score) and Garmin (Body Battery). Plus, Samsung added an FTP cycling test and new aerobic and anaerobic threshold heart rate zones.</p><p>When Wear OS 6 or 5.5 rolls around next year, we hope that Samsung takes things a step further from general body energy to physical readiness. Some watches will look at your recent activities and judge that you may be well-rested but still too sore to work out, recommending you wait X hours before your next one.</p><p>The other popular workout tool offered by Garmin and Apple is training load. It judges how your last week&apos;s workout intensity compares to past weeks, so you have data showing if you&apos;re improving or declining over time.</p><p>If Samsung gives the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 better tactile controls <em>and</em> new training load data, it&apos;ll quickly become one of the go-to fitness watch options for Android users, even compared to Garmin.</p>

<p>In March 2024, we heard a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">report</a> that Samsung executives "enthusiastically" considered a plan to "bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches" for the first time since the Gear S in 2014.</p><p>One could argue that the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> a return to a squarish design. The 1.5-inch circular display sits atop a squircle slab of metal, which is certainly unique! But that space is entirely cosmetic, adding weight without adding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-has-one-path-to-success">utility of extra display space</a>.</p><p>If Samsung continues to emulate Apple&apos;s design decisions, switching fully to a squircle display would be the next step. That&apos;s not a guarantee, and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">long-time Android watch users would hate that switch</a>, but it&apos;s a possibility.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, informed reporters that it will bring a generative AI overhaul to its AI assistant Bixby later "this year."</li><li>Roh added that the company sees such AI advancements as a "driver" for consumer interest and hopes to bring "convenience."</li><li>Google's Rick Osterloh was on stage during Unpacked to discuss the partnership with Samsung as both companies look to advance AI together.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following uncertain whispers, Samsung has come forward with information about how it will proceed with its AI assistant, Bixby.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/samsung-to-launch-upgraded-bixby-this-year-with-its-own-ai.html">CNBC</a> and confirmed that the company plans to overhaul Bixby "this year." Following Unpacked, Roh stated, "we’re going to advance Bixby with application of Gen AI technology." It seems that Samsung is interested in pushing the number of available generative AI features it provides and markets to consumers via its Galaxy devices.</p><p>Roh added, "as consumers use more AI capabilities, they can actually feel the convenience and benefits they bring. I believe strongly that these Galaxy AI and mobile AI are strong motivations and drivers for the purchase of new products."</p><p>However, despite Samsung&apos;s efforts to rapidly integrate more of its AI software into its devices, Galaxy products will still offer other options. Roh informed CNBC that Samsung will "maintain its strategy" of displaying multiple AI assistant options on its devices rather than just Galaxy AI.</p><p>Still, Roh did not divulge more about the specifics behind Bixby&apos;s upgrade slated for later in 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">Following the rumors in April</a>, we&apos;re we&apos;re finally getting confirmation of additional AI assistant upgrades. It was previously speculated that Samsung would move to bring Gen AI features to Bixby inspired by the work done at OpenAI for ChatGPT.</p><p>The rumor&apos;s source claimed that Samsung needed to "redefine" the purpose of Bixby due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">rise of LLMs</a> and generative AI features in a multitude of mediums.</p>

<p>Back in March, a SamMobile report claimed that Samsung executives wanted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">switch from its long-running circular Galaxy Watch design</a> for a squircle design, one it hadn&apos;t used since the Samsung Gear S in 2014 (see above).</p><p>"The idea is enthusiastically being considered internally," the report claimed.</p><p>We wrote at the time that Samsung couldn&apos;t redesign the Galaxy Watch 7 by the summer, but that the Galaxy Watch 8 would be a natural candidate for a major design switch if this report is true.</p><p>Of course, many people would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">hate a squircle Galaxy Watch</a>, since it reminds them too much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a>. But after Samsung aped Apple by selling a square-shaped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> — leaving behind its own Pro and Classic designs of models past — it might continue this trend in 2025 with a square-display Galaxy Watch 8.</p>

<p>We later heard via South Korean news site <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/english/11000625" target="_blank">Pulse News</a> that Hon Pak, Samsung&apos;s vice president and head of digital healthcare, wants to bring new health tracking features to Galaxy Watches, specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">blood glucose and diabetes monitoring</a>.</p><p>That same report claimed Samsung would develop the technology "as early as the second half of 2024," despite previous reports that blood glucose monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">would take a few years to arrive</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 may not have blood glucose, but it <em>does</em> have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">revamped Biosensor</a> capable of tracking your body&apos;s Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index. AGEs form when sugars interact with proteins or fats in your bloodstream, and they signal potential health conditions like diabetes or renal failure.</p><p>Evidently, Samsung intends to continue tracking new health vectors over time, using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to improve the results. So we can expect the Galaxy Watch 8 to continue this health-tracking revolution, whether it adds blood glucose or something more attainable.</p><p>We&apos;ve yet to hear more information — not surprising, given we&apos;re a year out from the Galaxy Watch 8 — but we&apos;ll keep this hub updated with any other leaks as they come in.</p>
<h2 id="our-galaxy-watch-8-wishlist-2">Our Galaxy Watch 8 wishlist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 made some significant upgrades: A faster Exynos chip, double the storage, a daily energy score based on sleep and fitness data, three times the LEDs for more accurate health tracking, sleep apnea detection, and more. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7 hands-on</a> time gave us a clear look at what to expect.</p><p>So, aside from a possible squircle display swap, where can the Galaxy Watch 8 improve? This is the Android Central staff&apos;s wishlist for Galaxy Watch 8 features:</p><p><strong>Bring back the Classic or Pro</strong></p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is an exciting product for serious athletes, with a totally rugged design and unique perks like a third "quick button" for shortcuts and an emergency siren. It&apos;s also $650, which is significantly cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> but still $200 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, Samsung&apos;s last titanium watch with long battery life.</p><p>Samsung told us in a Q&A session that it intends to keep selling the Watch 6 Classic, just like the Watch 5 Pro stayed in stock for two years. But there&apos;s still a gap for users who want a rotating bezel or extra battery life without needing every premium Ultra perk or accepting last-gen specs.</p><p>Our guess is that Samsung will deprecate its Classic and Pro watches in the short term, but we wouldn&apos;t mind being proven wrong! Just as Samsung sells three flagship phones, we think there&apos;s enough room for a mid-range option between the affordable Galaxy Watch 8 and the inevitable Galaxy Watch Ultra 2.</p><p><strong>Dare we say...a crown?</strong></p><p>Look, the Watch 7&apos;s digital bezel has always felt like a compromise compared to the physical bezel of Classic Galaxy Watches. It works, but haptic clicks aren&apos;t the same as the physical experience of turning a dial or crown. On the other hand, the Classic look makes Samsung watches much heavier and more expensive.</p><p>A lot of Android Central writers love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, in part because of the simplicity of using a dial instead of a touch bezel. It&apos;s the best alternative we can think of, and it&apos;s one that Samsung seems likely to use (since Apple loves its crowns, and Samsung has started emulating its rival&apos;s design choices).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LZnZruJKF3nWgV27yUZn7R" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-watch-ultra-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZnZruJKF3nWgV27yUZn7R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Samsung gave the Watch 7 (left) a digital bezel and the Watch Ultra (right) no bezel or crown at all. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Improve the core battery life</strong></p><p>Samsung&apos;s last four smartwatches have had an estimated battery life of 40, 50, 40, and 40 hours, respectively. Aside from that Galaxy Watch 5 blip, it&apos;s stuck to that number, ensuring that new watches with faster processors and new features remain efficient enough to last. With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you get 60 hours of battery life with AOD activated, or up to 100 hours in power saver mode.</p><p>Samsung, like Apple, makes you pay for higher-end models to get better battery life. But we&apos;ve seen recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> set to last from 80–100 hours in the same price range as the standard Watch 7. Google has even implemented a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a> that makes certain background functions use less battery life.</p><p>We can only hope Samsung evolves with the rest of the field and makes better battery life more of a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Continue to upgrade the health and fitness features</strong></p><p>With the Galaxy Watch 7, Samsung catered more to athletes with improved sensors, a daily Energy Score similar to other brands&apos; Daily Readiness or Body Battery scores, cycling FTP tests, and the ability to race your past routes. And the Galaxy Watch Ultra added dual-band GPS with a respectable 16 hours of tracking.</p><p>We appreciate that Samsung has chosen to take fitness more seriously, but you can still find plenty of areas where Samsung falls behind the pack.</p><p>Apple added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/what-is-training-load-on-watchos-11-the-new-feature-coming-to-apple-watch-that-will-change-your-workouts-forever">training load</a> to watchOS 11, so you can judge how your recent effort compares to past weeks&apos; and to your body&apos;s overall fitness level. You can also take rest days where you disable your daily rings when you&apos;re too tired, injured, or sick to keep up your streaks. Samsung should feel free to borrow these ideas, since Apple borrowed training load from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, since Samsung wants to make AI a major focus of its devices, we hope to see some kind of coaching AI tool on the next Wear OS update, giving recommendations on how long to walk, run, cycle, lift, or complete other workouts on a given day to improve.</p>

<p>We have a long time until we start to see proper Galaxy Watch 8 leaks from Samsung's offices. If you're impatient to buy a new Samsung watch and don't want to wait a whole year, then the Galaxy Watch 7 has a few key boosts to performance, storage, and health data to justify an immediate upgrade.</p></p>

The Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 does support the S Pen, but not all models are supported.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="there-is-good-news-and-bad-news-regarding-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-the-s-pen-2">There is good news and bad news regarding the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the S Pen</h2>
<p>When you have a display such as the one found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, you can&apos;t help but wonder if it supports the S Pen. The previous model supports it, so why shouldn&apos;t the latest one?</p><p>The good news is that the latest Samsung foldable supports the S pen, but the bad news is that it is a separate purchase. The S Pen models compatible with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are the S Pen Fold Edition and the S Pen Pro. However, they don&apos;t come in the box, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 does not have a design like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that allows you to carry it inside the chassis. If you decide to get an S Pen, you can also get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">Galaxy Z Fold 6 case</a> that allows you to easily store it on the back.</p><p>You can only use the S Pen on the main screen, not the external one. Remember that the S Pen Creator edition will not work on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. If you get the S Pen Fold Edition, you get a special case to put it away in, but that is not the case with the S Pen Pro edition. Another difference between the two S Pen variants is that the Pro version has Bluetooth functionality and two buttons, while the Fold Edition doesn&apos;t. Therefore, it doesn&apos;t need to be charged and only has one button.</p><p>The specifications they have in common are the 2.8ms latency and the auto-retractable Pro Tip. You can start using the S Pen Fold Edition on your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 as soon as you take it out of the box, no setup required. However, you&apos;ll need to charge the S Pen Pro using a USB-C cable and set the mode to match your new Z Fold phone. If you happen to use an incompatible S Pen, your Z Fold will show you a pop-up message letting you know.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to worry about charging another accessory, you can always go with the S Pen Fold Edition. It&apos;s currently available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/galaxy-z-fold5-s-pen-fold-edition-black-ej-pf946bbegus/">Samsung&apos;s official site for $55</a>, but you can also get it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098TTKX6J/?tag=androidpolice-20&ascsubtag=UUapUeUpU55241&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fs-pen-fold-edition-vs-s-pen-pro%2F&asc_campaign=Commerce&th=1">Amazon for $50</a>. Be careful not to get the S Pen you would use with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra since they are incompatible. The Z Fold series requires a stylus with a soft tip due to the difference in screen technologies. It&apos;s best to avoid buying a stylus from cheap and unknown brands since you can get stuck with one that doesn&apos;t work or, worse, one that damages the display.</p>
