<p>To go beyond the tech niche into the mainstream, smart rings might need a "killer app" to stand out and justify their high prices. It&apos;s unclear <em>which</em> features they need versus the ones added to pad spec sheets or make them sound futuristic.</p><p>Smart rings have exploded in 2024, for better or worse. You can barely go a week without some new brand launching a smart ring Kickstarter, each one promising more features than the last. Before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> arrives, they&apos;re all rushing out rival products with outlandish promises and (mostly) interchangeable features.</p><p>In this oversaturated market, brand recognition gives Samsung and Oura an advantage. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> has a few missing features, and Galaxy Ring leaks suggest its first-generation device won&apos;t have as many "smarts" as you might think.</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> and consulted my smart ring-loving colleagues, I have a list of potential smart ring features that either haven&apos;t been implemented yet or are rare to find but would make this smart jewelry much more likely to boom in popularity. </p>
<h2 id="any-quot-find-my-lost-ring-quot-option-2">Any "Find my lost ring" option</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People lose jewelry all the time, but losing a $10 gold band from Target and a $300+ smart ring aren&apos;t comparable. And right now, losing a smart ring is pretty much irrevocable. Built-in GPS or a speaker might make a ring too bulky, and no smart rings use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network or any sort of method for tracking it down. </p><p>A recent Galaxy Ring leak suggests Samsung will add a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-find-app-lost-mode-discovery">"Lost Mode" function</a> that triggers a flashing LED and disables any data sharing if someone else finds it. I don&apos;t think this goes far enough, however, since a light won&apos;t help if the ring falls into a couch cushion or is left somewhere far away.</p><p>What you <em>really</em> need is for a smart ring to use your phone&apos;s GPS to save its exact location the moment its wear detection catches you taking it off, so you know generally where to look. Once you&apos;re in the immediate area, something like Ultra Wideband (UWB) could be the best option for tracking down a ring that&apos;s hard to find — assuming it wouldn&apos;t make the ring too heavy.</p>
<h2 id="subtle-versatile-haptics-2">Subtle, versatile haptics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="heJKFV8NLSybhDoZebpWNM" name="circular-ring-photo.jpg" alt="Close-up of the Circular Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/heJKFV8NLSybhDoZebpWNM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Circular Ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many people like smart rings because they&apos;re <em>not</em> like smartwatches. You get passive health data without constant notifications buzzing your wrist. That being said, haptics are a common request we&apos;ve seen in our forum about smart rings. </p><p>People who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep with smartwatches</a> mention that they use their watch&apos;s alarm function to subtly buzz themselves awake. To replace smartwatches for those people, a smart ring will need the same effect. It wouldn&apos;t need a <em>strong</em> motor to work at this size to wake you up, either.</p><p>Circular is the one ring we know of with a vibration motor. The smart ring uses buzzes not just for alarms but also for notifications, reminders, and breathing exercise cues. Not everyone will want their jewelry buzzing at them all day, but haptics will help make smart rings feel essential to some people.</p>
<h2 id="afib-and-other-health-tricks-2">AFib and other health tricks</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3659px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-in-hand.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzZ9w48Ygxh6RbrNi64DRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3659" height="2058" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some people prefer wearing smarts-free luxury watches for their style and simplicity; others, like my parents, simply don&apos;t like watches, especially bulky and complicated ones. But that tech-averse crowd might wear a smart ring if it gave them enough health data to matter.</p><p>Most smart rings have the essentials: resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) for stress and energy recovery, blood oxygen (SpO2), skin temperature, breathing rate, and burned calories. A few, like Oura, give you automatic workout detection via the accelerometer. </p><p>Then you have some pretty intense promises. Several 2024 Kickstarter smart rings promise blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiograms (ECG) for irregular heart rhythm (AFib) warnings are on the horizon. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yogifi/yogifi-smart-ring" target="_blank">YogiFi smart ring</a> Kickstarter lists smoking and eating detection as "coming soon," while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ringoofficial/ringo-master-wellness-and-media-with-your-fingertips">Ringo smart ring</a> has body composition analysis for body fat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PspTJamiUi2F8uJZfLLiYA" name="samsung-health-monitor-blood-pressure.gif" alt="Samsung Health Monitor Blood Pressure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PspTJamiUi2F8uJZfLLiYA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Blood pressure reading on a Galaxy Watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart rings&apos; popularity will depend on their accuracy, not an exhaustive list of data. Consumers are smart enough to notice the difference between accurate results and vague "wellness" diagnostics you can&apos;t trust, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/when-it-comes-to-your-health-dont-place-too-much-trust-in-your-smartwatch">no one should rely on blood pressure or AFib data</a> that&apos;s not FDA-approved.</p><p>That disclaimer aside, portable blood pressure and passive AFib monitoring would be an <em>industry-shifting</em> feature that would immediately appeal to millions of people above 50 as an early warning system, making smart rings an actual alternative to smartwatches for people who want a stripped-down experience.</p><p>The question is which smart ring brand can pull either feature off first. Early Galaxy Ring leaks suggested it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-galaxy-ring-could-challenge-galaxy-watch-6">have blood pressure monitoring</a>, but Samsung added BP readings to the Galaxy Watch 4 and has yet to get FDA approval for its use in the United States. That could hold true with its Galaxy Ring, as well. </p>
<h2 id="nfc-tap-to-pay-with-authentication-2">NFC tap-to-pay (with authentication)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BikcAunQLb57nwBRz2DGXZ" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-google-wallet.jpeg" alt="Google Wallet on the Fitbit Charge 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BikcAunQLb57nwBRz2DGXZ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This <em>should</em> be an easy one. You can buy a cheap ring with NFC functionality on Amazon for much less than a typical smart ring. The problem is the inability to add a PIN or any other method to authenticate a payment, which is probably why most well-known smart rings don&apos;t support it. </p><p>I have a potential solution in mind for this: users must enable tap-to-pay in the companion app after they put the ring on, with a PIN code. The moment that the wear detection catches you removing your ring, the NFC function is automatically disabled until you turn it back on. That way, someone can&apos;t snatch a ring off your hand or nightstand to go on a shopping spree. </p><p>I don&apos;t know if this is possible, but it would let smart rings add contactless payments so that someone would need to physically drag your hand onto an NFC reader to commit fraud.</p>
<h2 id="touch-or-gesture-controls-2">Touch or gesture controls</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.38%;"><img id="K6FaxaDHqWJBEVi8QPXYgj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-patent-2.jpeg" alt="A patent of the Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6FaxaDHqWJBEVi8QPXYgj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="522" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Electronics patent (via The Elec))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung patents show the Galaxy Ring used as a controller for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/apple/apple-files-patent-for-smart-ring-that-can-control-multiple-interfaces-and-devices" target="_blank">iMore</a> describes an Apple Ring patent with gesture controls like "hand pinching, waving, pointing, and tapping a palm" tracked by the ring to control other Apple devices. Plus, a couple of Kickstarter rings promise touchpads or gesture controls.</p><p>If a ring touchpad triggered shortcut actions on your phone with a double tap or long-press, that could be very useful! The same goes for simple gestures like pinching or palm-tapping that you&apos;re unlikely to use in real life. On the other hand, I can imagine a tiny touchpad being quite finicky and prone to false positives, or gestures being triggered accidentally. </p><p>That said, Circular also seems to have this covered, to some extent, with a "button" that can be used for things like turning off vibration alarms on the ring.</p><p>Anyone with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> with proper touch controls and screens wouldn&apos;t replace their watch with a ring for these substitute tricks. So, I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;d qualify as killer features or if companies are simply trying to justify the "smart" in smart rings. </p>
<h2 id="a-new-distinct-style-2">A new, distinct style</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-next-to-regular-ring.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air next to a typical ring to show its size, surrounded by other jewelry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMPRBuPqBEmv2StvX6UTHa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll quickly round out my list with something that&apos;s not a "feature" but is more vital than anything else. Most smart rings are thick, spartan, and not especially distinct from one another. However, aesthetics matter, and smart rings need to find a particular look that every day people accept.</p><p>Apple Watches have only succeeded because Apple convinced everyone that squircles are stylish and distinct. Android watches mimic classic timepiece designs. Either way, people accept them not just because they&apos;re about the same size as a regular watch but because they&apos;ve grown to accept that trademark style.</p><p>That&apos;s why companies need to pick their battles, adding enough smart ring features to make them indispensable but not so packed with half-assed tricks that it&apos;s ugly and unreliable. I&apos;m excited to see which smart ring is the first to pull off a balanced style that appeals outside of tech circles. It might be Oura or Samsung, but time will tell.</p>

For me, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> checked a lot of boxes, as I prefer larger watches. It was fast, and the battery life was absolutely insane. Fast-forward to today and Mobvoi is trying to re-capture my attention with the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro. </p><p>A year after the launch of the original TicWatch Pro 5, the Pro 5 Enduro aims to offer a few improvements, setting its sights on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. But there&apos;s quite a bit more to the story than what meets the eye.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-price-and-availability"><span>TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YG3gfKkzh7C3hRruE4ZXEV" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-07.jpg" alt="Group of friends running while wearing TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YG3gfKkzh7C3hRruE4ZXEV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming as little surprise, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is priced exactly the same as its predecessor. It&apos;s available now and you can get it from either Mobvoi directly or Amazon, retailing for $349. At the time of release, the only color option for the Pro 5 Enduro is Obsidian. However, we won&apos;t be surprised if Mobvoi releases a "Sandstone" color as a mid-cycle release in a few months.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-specs-and-features"><span>TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro: Specs and features</span></h2>

<p>For the most part, the TicWatch Pro 5 and Pro 5 Enduro are practically identical. When it comes to the internals, you won&apos;t find any differences, as the Pro 5 Enduro is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. It also features the same 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage to go along with the 628mAh battery. </p><p>We also have the same 1.43-inch OLED display, complete with Mobvoi&apos;s excellent Ultra-low-power Display. This combination provides up to 90 hours of battery life in "Smart Mode," and up to 45 days in "Essential Mode." Again, nothing new to see here. </p><p>Mobvoi also continues to rely on the same sensors for both health tracking and connectivity. Sadly, those hoping for a cellular version are out of luck as the Pro 5 Enduro sticks to Wi-Fi only.</p>

<p>The Pro 5 Enduro looks practically the same as its predecessor. This includes the Obsidian colorway, complete with the 24mm case size, and the rotating crown that sports a little red ring for a bit of flair. </p>

<p>That said, Mobvoi is introducing a couple of notable changes, the first of which is moving from relying on Gorilla Glass in favor of Sapphire Crystal. This is by no means an industry-first, as both Samsung and Apple have already been there and done that. Nevertheless, it&apos;s still a nice improvement, especially if you&apos;re the outdoorsy type.</p><p>Two more changes can be found on the right side of the casing, as the rotating crown and side button have been altered. The rotating crown is now a bit larger, making it less flush with the side casing and easier to scroll. As for the side button, it is also slightly larger but ditches the ridged design in favor of one that&apos;s smooth and matches the rest of the outer casing. </p>

<p>Without burying the lede too much here, I really adore the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro, much like I did with the Pro 5. Performance is snappy, while I appreciate the subtle changes to the crown and side button. I&apos;m also not going to re-hash the overall performance too much, as not much has really changed. </p><p>It still breezes through menus, reacts to my interactions, and feeds me notifications without a hitch. I have yet to actually run into an issue where the Pro 5 Enduro froze or anything of the sort. It&apos;s really the kind of performance that I would expect on a top-tier Wear OS smartwatch, and I&apos;m happy that the Pro 5 Enduro continues to deliver.</p><p>But the best part has nothing to do with performance or how the Pro 5 Enduro looks. <em>It&apos;s all about that battery</em>. Oh man, does this thing just last for <em>days</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3dPtGHHvq4UVwtruiiS3NW" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-app-drawer-google-home.jpeg" alt="App Drawer on TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3dPtGHHvq4UVwtruiiS3NW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who recently became a first-time dad, I find it hard enough to keep up with my baby and his schedule. However, this is also one of the reasons why I wear a smartwatch, as I can turn lights on and off and keep track of his feedings and potty times, even if I leave my phone in another room. </p><p>I mention this to say that I&apos;ve noticed the battery in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> is starting to feel a bit long in the tooth. Thus, there have already been plenty of times when I needed to respond to someone or just check the time to find that the battery was dead. </p><p>Thankfully, that&apos;s not something <em>else</em> for me to worry about with the Enduro. It&apos;s like the Energizer bunny that just keeps going, and going, and going, and going, and yeah, you get the idea. Part of that is thanks to the SoC and co-processor, along with any refinement Mobvoi has done via software. </p><p>The rest of it comes down to the incredibly awesome Ultra-low-power display. It&apos;s been a staple on flagship TicWatch models since the original TicWatch Pro, and I couldn&apos;t be happier that it&apos;s stayed.</p>

<p>Okay, so here&apos;s the thing. It really gets under my skin when a company releases a device and then makes me feel like it&apos;s been abandoned. In my TicWatch Pro 5 review, I dedicated an entire section to "future update concerns." Unfortunately, Mobvoi has mostly proven me right, and it&apos;s only getting worse from here.</p><p>Out of the box, the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro, released just ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, is still running Wear OS 3.5. Not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, which debuted at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2023-biggest-announcements">I/O 2023</a> and was released in August 2023. Now, there&apos;s another major update on the horizon, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> coming to Pixel and Galaxy Watches at some point this year, meaning that this brand-new smartwatch will fall even further behind. </p><p>Besides the principles of supporting a device that people spend money on, I could honestly go without a lot of the various "QoL" improvements from Wear OS 4. However, as someone who changes phones almost as often as their underwear, I <em>need</em> the ability to move the watch from one phone to the next without properly resetting it. Yes, I know backups exist, but they take <em>forever, </em>and it&apos;s a problem that Google has already solved, so Mobvoi needs to get it together by supporting quick phone transfers via Wear OS 4.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="2xQX8yMB3Bmn9EX8KwHjoS" name="ticwatch-pro-5-and-pro-5-enduro-bottom-1.jpeg" alt="TicWatch Pro 5 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2xQX8yMB3Bmn9EX8KwHjoS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Funnily enough, it was only in late April that Mobvoi opened a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">Wear OS 4 beta program</a> for the TicWatch Pro 5. However, it wasn&apos;t an open beta, and we haven&apos;t heard anything about when it would actually be arriving. If anything, I expected the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro to come with Wear OS 4, but since this is really just the company slapping on a little makeup, I guess I should&apos;ve seen this coming. </p><p>It&apos;s really a shame, too, because, besides some other minor gripes, the Pro 5 Enduro is a great smartwatch. If you&apos;re wondering what one of those gripes is, it&apos;s that Mobvoi wants you to pay $350 for a smartwatch that may or may not get updates. </p><p>There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with the price, considering what the Enduro delivers. Discounts or deals notwithstanding, that&apos;s about $70 less than what Samsung charges for the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. But at least you know that you&apos;ll be getting the latest Wear OS updates when they&apos;re made available, and relatively quickly.</p><p>The last gripe that I have is a small one, to me at least, and that the Pro 5 Enduro is just too big for some. It&apos;s the opposite problem that I had with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, which is too small for my wrist, while the Enduro fits like a glove. But that&apos;s more subjective, as some people with smaller wrists might prefer a smartwatch that feels like a G-Shock.</p>

<p>Although Fossil recently exited the smartwatch market, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> arrived in global markets after its predecessor saw a limited release. More importantly, OnePlus opted to go with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">dual-OS approach</a>, utilizing both RTOS and Wear OS. The end result is a smartwatch that is capable of lasting for up to three days and sports a "premium design."</p><p>From there, the more obvious competition to the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro comes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>. Samsung gets points for software updates, coming in multiple sizes and colors, and the excellent rotating bezel. Samsung also gains an edge for those who want multiple bands courtesy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-and-watch-6-classic-watch-bands">22mm band size</a>, compared to the 24mm of the Enduro.</p><p>Pivoting away from Wear OS options, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> is another competitor to the Enduro. It, too, utilizes an AMOLED display and lasts for up to 14 days on a single charge. When it comes to health and fitness tracking, there&apos;s a reason why many opt to go with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> over the competition. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best battery life in a Wear OS smartwatch.</li><li>You're looking for a Wear OS smartwatch that doesn't come from Google or Samsung.</li><li>You want a smartwatch with a big screen.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest version of Wear OS.</li><li>You have smaller wrists. </li><li>You need or want a smartwatch with cellular connectivity.</li><li>You already have the TicWatch Pro 5.</li></ul>
<p>In some ways, the release of the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro feels like a kick in the pants. It&apos;s an iterative update over the Pro 5 in the truest sense, only bringing minor changes but for the same price. It probably would have made more sense for Mobvoi to wait until its Wear OS 4 update was ready before launching it because now, there are two wearables that are a version behind. However, since everything internally is the same, both the Pro 5 and the Enduro <em>should </em>get the update at the same time.</p><p>On the flip side, if you <em>don&apos;t</em> already have the TicWatch Pro 5 and are looking for a smartwatch with incredible battery life, then the Enduro should be at the top of your list. While Samsung is rumored to be introducing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a>, it&apos;s likely still a few months away at the time of writing. Plus, the rumored "squircle" design might not be for everyone, and we don&apos;t yet know if Galaxy AI will bog down the software. </p><p>If you don&apos;t care about software updates and just want a Wear OS smartwatch that lasts forever, then get the Pro 5 Enduro. It really is a great smartwatch, and is one that I&apos;ll continue to wear until something else piques my interest. </p>

<hr>
<p>If you bought Spotify&apos;s Car Thing and it’s about to become a paperweight, here&apos;s some good news: Spotify is now offering refunds for the $90 device.</p><p>Spotify told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/30/spotify-begins-offering-car-thing-refunds-as-it-faces-lawsuit-over-bricking-the-streaming-device/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> that they’ve started giving refunds to anyone who contacts customer support and shows proof of purchase, like an email receipt. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-car-thing-review">Car Thing</a> launched in early 2022 after quietly rolling out to some Spotify Premium subscribers for free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotifys-newest-thing-car-thing">in late 2021</a>.</p><p>The device was designed as a fix for cars that didn’t have built-in displays with Apple CarPlay or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>. It acted as an external remote with voice commands and preset buttons on a four-inch color touchscreen.</p><p>But Spotify pulled the plug on Car Thing just five months after its release. Last month, they told customers their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-kills-car-thing">devices would stop working on December 9</a>.</p><p>Spotify said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review" target="_blank">support page</a> that this move is part of their efforts to streamline their products and focus on new features for a better user experience. It seems like a cost-cutting move after a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-cuts-1500-jobs">tough year with layoffs</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-price-increase-new-plans-claims">a price hike</a>.</p><p>This decision has upset many users, leading to a class-action lawsuit filed on May 28 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit claims Spotify misled customers by selling a device that would soon be obsolete without offering refunds.</p><p>Initially, reports indicated that there would be no refunds, but Spotify&apos;s FAQ page now says that customers can contact support with proof of purchase to discuss refund options.</p><p>Interestingly, Spotify said they started processing refunds on May 24, a few days before the lawsuit was filed, suggesting they might have started this to dodge legal trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, Google dropped yet another wearable, but this time, for a different audience—kids. The Fitbit Ace LTE arrived, but the hook is it comes with a subscription, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/we-need-to-stop-letting-companies-double-dip-with-high-upfront-costs-and-required-subscriptions">most gadgets</a> these days. While it resembles the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>, the Ace LTE comes with features similar to the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. </p><p>This new wearable is water resistant up to 50 meters, while the screen uses Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Regarding connectivity, the watch has 4G LTE, 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and even NFC, which will eventually enable tap-to-pay functionality, likely via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>The watch comes with six games out of the box that will get kids moving. The goal is "at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day," and kids get "awards" for building streaks on the watch. </p><p>When it comes to security, the new Fitbit Ace app allows parents to control and monitor everything their children are doing with the watch. This includes adding up to 20 trusted contacts for your kids to call or text, viewing their location, and more. Parents can set up School Time to keep apps/ notifications on the watch restricted to avoid distractions during school hours.</p><p>This new smartwatch, priced at $229.95, will be available from Google and Amazon starting June 5. Additionally, for cellular connectivity, parents must sign up for the "Ace Pass," which costs $9.99 per month or $119.99 per year.</p>

When users visited the Google News page, it displayed upside-down ice cream cones with an error message: "Uh-oh, something went wrong. Please try again." </p><p>It wasn&apos;t just Google News that was down—creating new documents in Google Drive was throwing up errors, too, and our staff wasn&apos;t able to get some two-factor authentication dialogs to appear on my phone, which also relies on Google services.</p><p>However, after multiple hours of downtime, Google&apos;s services began to stabilize. Eventually, the situation was resolved and users were able to get back into their Google services.</p>

The new Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 is powered by Intel&apos;s Core Ultra 5. It sports a 14-inch touchscreen display, a 1440p QHD webcam, and multiple ports.</p><p>Next up is the Chromebook Plus 516 GE—much like its predecessor, the Chromebook 516 GE, it continues to include many of the same design choices and features. This one can be used for cloud gaming due to the 16-inch, 2560x1600, 120Hz display. The Chromebook Plus 516 GE is powered by Intel&apos;s 13th Gen. Both of these Chromebooks will be available this month, with prices starting at either $699 or $749.</p><p>Asus is introducing two new Chromebooks. The Chromebook Plus CX34 is the company&apos;s flagship. It has a traditional 14-inch screen, is powered by the 13th-generation Intel Core i5, and can be configured with or without a touchscreen. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Chromebook CM30 is the first ChromeOS-powered tablet for consumers since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Lenovo&apos;s Chromebook Duet 3</a>. The CM30 is bundled with a magnetic stand cover, keyboard, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a>, which is great for multitasking and switching between gaming to writing down notes or using the CM30 as a drawing tablet.</p><p>HP also refreshed its Chromebook lineup with the Chromebook Plus x360, a 2-in-1 14-inch touchscreen and long battery life. It also unveiled a budget-friendly option, HP Chromebook 14, featuring a 14-inch display, 1080p webcam, and over 12 hours of battery life.</p><p>Additionally, Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Chromebooks are getting a slew of GenAI features</a> powered by Gemini and that anyone who buys a new Chromebook Plus model will receive 12 months of Google One AI Premium for free.</p>

If you&apos;re texting in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>-supported thread, users can now long-press and edit the text message within 15 minutes of it being sent. </p><p>A pencil icon (edit) will appear on the top bar of Messages. Tapping it will restructure the writing field to say "edit message," followed by the earlier drafted text. Users can correct mistakes or add to it and then hit the check mark. </p><p>While we are on the topic of texting, this feature update will also bring "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">Emoji Sticker Combinations</a>," which fuse two of your selected emojis for a unique new creation.

A Google Home Favorites tiles and complications will let users easily view and control device functions like unlocking your door, managing the lights, or changing the temperature.</p><p>The June update wraps up with a quick tease of the "Instant hotspot" feature that allows users to connect their Android tablets or Chromebooks to their phone&apos;s hotspot, which will be "coming soon."</p>

Certain strings in the code suggest the Galaxy Ring will feature a blinking light on its body so users can find it.</p><p> A few string examples include "Tap start to make the light on your ring blink" and "Ring light is blinking."</p><p>Another string will appear if your phone can&apos;t reach the Galaxy Ring. The example reads, "couldn&apos;t connect to Ring to start blinking."</p><p>The publication&apos;s APK findings show that users must first enable "Lost Mode" through the Samsung Find app. The ring is also said to have a secure lock feature that will come in handy to safeguard user-specific data on the ring. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was this thing called AI. It started as a bit of code that could amalgamate information from one source so it could be manipulated to do useful things. As it grew, people writing that sort of code realized that there was potential to do even more useful things with it so dedicated computers were designed and built to be programmed to crunch the code even faster. </p><p>Then, someone — call him Jeff — decided that everything needed more AI. Jeff might have been drunk or high that day. Jeff pitched his idea to the "right" person, and AI transformed from something useful into something stupid. And you can&apos;t get away from it.</p>
<p>I know I&apos;m biased. After all, I have to look at tech all day, every day to make my living because my lifelong dream of being a professional slacker isn&apos;t going to pay my bills. I also know that I&apos;m not alone and a lot of people are getting sick and tired of <em>AI this</em> and <em>AI that</em> every time they look at a screen.</p><p>I&apos;m also not some Luddite or an old man yelling at the clouds. At least not this time. There are some valid concerns about AI and how it&apos;s taken over every facet of our tech lives. Dammit, Jeff, this is all your fault.</p>

<p>AI doing things like monitoring apps that use too much of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-standby-battery-life-improvement-discussed">phone&apos;s battery</a> is great. AI that makes it easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">fix a picture</a> you took so that Grandpa looks awake or one of the kids isn&apos;t digging in the mud is fine and convenient. AI trying to actively teach you something could be good... but it&apos;s not.</p><p>That&apos;s because AI isn&apos;t intelligent (regardless of the label on the tin) and can&apos;t really learn anything. AI, at every level, is just a computer program that spits out the information it was programmed to spit out. Google has given us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">plenty of proof</a> with the mess that is AI Search (and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">admits it</a>), and anyone who asks ChatGPT about drying towels knows zero critical thinking is involved. Is cramming it into every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new phone</a> or laptop really such a good idea?</p>
<p>It&apos;s comical in a way, and laughing at the dumb shit a company worth billions is willing to spit out is fun. Those programming uber-nerd types make the same mistakes we do because they are people; humans aren&apos;t perfect. But those errors aren&apos;t the problem.</p><p>Those arise when the errors sound plausible and correct enough that we believe them. AI leans heavily on <del>plagiarizing</del> copying things someone else has already said. Since people aren&apos;t perfect and can make mistakes, sometimes AI is going to be wrong, but it <em>sounds</em> like it&apos;s right. Unless we can fact-check everything some conversational AI bot tells us, we aren&apos;t going to know. </p><p>Do you want to take the time to fact-check everything <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">Microsoft CoPilot</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> tells you? Nope. Neither do I. If I&apos;m doing that, I could skip the bot and look it up myself. Relying on a bot that may or may not be right is lazy, and companies want us to do more of it.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t get me started on people who purposefully use AI to spread bad information. Every time some politician or stupid "action group" uses AI to make an image where people have 11 fingers across three arms and try to pass it off as proof of something, a kitten dies. Those are bad, evil people, and AI helps them become badder and more evil.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do-about-it-2">So what can we do about it?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="WAXqT2D4Vn4xeYx56vqBb9" name="Amish.jpg" alt="An Amish man" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAXqT2D4Vn4xeYx56vqBb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="561" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NPR)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unless you are willing to throw away everything you own that has a screen, you will be inundated by stupid AI. Eventually, AI should get better, but nobody is going to slow down and wait for it. Doing the right things isn&apos;t as profitable as telling us how AI will "disrupt" some sectors, and company X is going to be at the forefront. AI is a tech buzzword that isn&apos;t going away anytime soon.</p><p>You have all the tools to combat the insanity; you only have to use them. Think critically. Know that there is a high likelihood that anything AI tells you is wrong. Know that the Facebook group your uncle is in will be more than willing to spread doctored AI-generated images. Know that now, more than ever, much of what you see is a lie, and you&apos;ll quickly learn how to sort fact from fiction.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not up to us to fix this mess. I hope the companies who have pushed this at us are willing to do it, but we can only depend on them to do the profitable thing.</p><p>In the meantime feel free to think less of every tech company willing to be so bad at it.</p>

But beyond music streaming, Gabb is positioning itself as a safe space for kids to gradually transition into the world of technology and explore content in today&apos;s digital age.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FYPbYKw8wz6uBae7Za7BX9" name="Gabb-Phone-Z2-Kids-Phone-lifestyle-03.jpg" alt="Gabb Phone Z2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYPbYKw8wz6uBae7Za7BX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gabb, founded in 2018, has been making internet-free phones for kids ages 5 and 15. The company says it has taken a leadership role in providing research and education and developing solutions that empower parents with the tools to keep their children safe. It creates devices and apps that consider the age factor and the &apos;coolness&apos; aspect of the gadgets it creates.</p><p>"While still protecting (kids) from gaming addictions, dangers of predators, bullies, exposure to explicit language or inappropriate language and images," Brandon Jeppson, Gabb&apos;s director of marketing, told me in an email.</p><p>Regarding smartphones, the brand&apos;s latest Gabb phone and Gabb Phone 3 Pro have no internet connectivity, but they do provide the essential apps needed for each stage of development from grade school through high school. For instance, Gabb&apos;s teen-friendly phone is compatible with third-party apps like Kahoot, Duolingo, Gabb Maps, etc., which parents can enable if they feel their teens are ready.</p><p>These phones also come equipped with kid-safe messaging through Gabb Messenger, which constantly monitors texts and notifies parents if their kids are exposed to inappropriate content, opening up necessary conversations in families. Parents can also request that the company add certain apps that they feel are necessary in school or in public settings.</p><p>"Unlike other tech solutions, Gabb has kids as our first thought, not as an afterthought," Jeppson added.</p>

<p>After delving into music, Gabb highlights how parents wanted a platform that stages safe music options with no explicit content that their kids may accidentally encounter, so the company created a Gabb Music + subscription.</p><p>"Gabb Music doesn&apos;t just bleep out lyrics; instead, every explicit song and innuendo has been filtered out entirely using industry-leading tools and proprietary technology," said Gabb CEO Nate Randle.</p><p>The result is a curated music library that the whole family can listen to. Kids can search for songs and artists, create their own playlists, and download them on the go, much like on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> like Spotify or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>.</p><p>Gabb&apos;s watches offer benefits similar to those of its phones. The latest Gabb Watch 3 allows calling and texting pre-approved contacts, ensuring kids stay connected with their families. These wearables also have an inbuilt GPS tracking system and an SOS button that provides an added layer of security when kids are away from home.</p>

<p>If you handed a toddler a smartphone today, you’d be surprised how they’d probably unlock your phone and start launching apps that interest them—which could lead them into a path of screen addictions when they’re supposed to be learning life skills.</p><p>Parents are constantly debating the right age to give their children a phone due to the increased psychological risks. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sapienlabs.org/whats_new/study-out-from-sapien-labs-links-age-of-first-smartphone-to-mental-wellbeing/">global study</a> of nearly 28,000 young adults showed a strong correlation between the age children receive their first smartphone and their mental health. It states, "the later the age at which these young adults first got a phone or tablet that they could carry with them in childhood, the better their mental well-being."</p><p>In today&apos;s vastly connected world, with access to smartphones and the internet, teens are bound to stumble upon inappropriate content and be subject to bullying, which, in turn, impacts their self-worth and ability to relate to others in a positive way. While most social media apps have age restrictions, bypassing those walls and getting through is equally easy.</p><p>Another study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/132/5/958/31699/Children-Adolescents-and-the-Media?autologincheck=redirected">highlights</a> how 8 to 10-year-olds spend almost eight hours a day with various media, and older children and teenagers spend around 11 hours with media, leaving them susceptible to unwanted content or even social media predators.</p><p>That&apos;s where companies like Gabb come in, providing essential tools for parental control and age-appropriate functionality. Gabb says it tries to create an environment for kids to safely switch to other devices when they are adults while striving to remain relevant in today&apos;s AI-powered world. </p><p>That said, Gabb isn&apos;t the only company making kids-safe tech. Recently, Google announced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a kids-only smartwatch that aims to promote a more healthy and active lifestyle. The wearable is not all about step-tracking— it also comes with "games" and other ways to get kids into the habit of staying active. The Ace LTE also offers calling, messaging, and location sharing.</p><p>"We believe the new appearance of other competitors is a validation of the growing interest in our mission to empower parents and kids to connect safely in a digital world," Jeppson added.</p><p>Despite other entrants into the market, Gabb feels that it has had a substantial head start on the competition and has established a loyal, growing customer base. </p><p>"We also continue to see a strong response from parents to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gabb.com/blog/tech-in-steps/">Tech in Steps</a> (aligning products with developmental stages) and the kid-first approach to helping kids and teens safely connect to family and friends."</p>

<ul><li>Many users have reported problems with the Meta Quest Guardian Boundary making them float or being tilted.</li><li>Normal methods of resetting the boundary don't always fix the problem, and it happens while sitting and standing in both roomscale and stationary boundaries.</li><li>The problem is caused by lying down mode, which was introduced in Meta Quest update v64 in April 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over the past month or so, I&apos;ve been struggling with weird problems with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>&apos;s guardian boundary. I&apos;d find myself floating above the floor in many Quest games, even though my height was set correctly, and I recently retraced my Guardian boundary. Even resetting the boundary wouldn&apos;t help.</p><p>I also found that my floor would tilt at an uncomfortable angle when I reset my guardian boundary by holding down the Oculus or Meta button on the right controller. My son reported many of the same issues on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-64gb-vs-oculus-quest-2-256gb">Meta Quest 2</a></p><p>Thankfully, I found a fix! Turns out, the lying-down mode introduced in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">Meta Quest update V64</a> in April is the culprit. Fixing the problem requires turning off lying-down mode. While that&apos;s annoying for folks who enjoy the feature, it&apos;s at least nice to be able to fix it in a quick way. Here&apos;s how to do that:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Click the <strong>Meta or Oculus button </strong>on your right controller to bring up the universal menu bar.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Open up the <strong>quick settings panel</strong> by clicking on the clock.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button on the top right.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Go into <strong>Experimental </strong>features by tapping the tile.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Click on the slider next to <strong>use apps while lying down</strong> to turn the feature off.</p>

<p>Once that&apos;s done, it&apos;s best to reset your Guardian Boundary settings to get a fresh start and ensure everything is good to go. To do that, head back into the <strong>settings </strong>menu, then click <strong>Physical Space</strong>, then tap on the <strong>clear</strong> button next to the <strong>clear boundary history</strong> option.</p><p>Once that&apos;s done, you&apos;ll need to redraw your Guardian Boundary by following the on-screen steps. If you want to re-set up your room for mixed reality, open <strong>settings </strong>on your Meta Quest 3, tap <strong>Physical Space</strong>, then launch the <strong>setup tool </strong>found under the <strong>spaces tab</strong>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most of my gaming is done on my Windows rig or the PlayStation 5, and while I tend to play a few casual titles on my phone, they don&apos;t need a controller. I didn&apos;t bother with mobile controllers up to this point, but using the Steam Deck reinvigorated my interest in handhelds (I&apos;m obsessed with Balatro), and I wanted to see what Android has to offer.</p><p>It didn&apos;t take long to realize that Android has a lot of amazing games, so I needed to get my hands on a mobile controller. I have a dozen PS5 and Xbox controllers, but I wanted something designed to be used with a phone, and my search led to GameSir, specifically the G8 Galileo.</p><p>The G8 Galileo is GameSir&apos;s latest mobile controller, and it has a lot of unique features. It has full-size triggers and buttons, and it is just as comfortable to use as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/scuf-reflex-pro-ps5-controller-review">Scuf Reflex Pro</a>, my preferred PS5 controller. It has an extensible design that can easily slot in a variety of phones, and the USB-C port pivots, making it incredibly convenient to attach a phone to the controller.</p><p>If you&apos;ve tried out a mobile controller but weren&apos;t satisfied with the sizing or build quality, you should take a look at the G8 Galileo.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VfvWCtGpLkXye2XKt64BvH" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-4.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo thumbsticks have hall effect triggers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VfvWCtGpLkXye2XKt64BvH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GameSir unveiled the G8 Galileo in November 2023, and the mobile controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG">costs just $79 on Amazon</a>. You can also buy it for the same $79 retail price <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-g8-galileo">via GameSir&apos;s website</a>, and while you don&apos;t get a carrying case with the package — unlike other GameSir products — you can buy a bundle by shelling out an additional $10.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gamesir-g8-galileo-design-and-features"><span>GameSir G8 Galileo: Design and features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3DWEkFt2pzT4RJzxUagfyM" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-13.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo next to Scuf Reflex Pro and Instinct controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3DWEkFt2pzT4RJzxUagfyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The G8 Galileo is larger than other mobile controllers, and this is a good thing. Using it against GameSir&apos;s X3 controller, the difference is immediately noticeable — the full-size D-pad, triggers, and buttons make it feel closer to using an Xbox controller, and that goes a long way while gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pkqr9ugTV4Yb7sQpLDBc4L" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-16.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo with Pixel 8 Pro next to X3 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pkqr9ugTV4Yb7sQpLDBc4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fit and finish is outstanding; the G8 Galileo feels much better in-hand than the X3, and the contoured design at the back with the textured finish makes it incredibly comfortable to hold and use. That said, it is on the heavier side at 251g, and when you add the weight of a phone, you&apos;re going to notice the heft, particularly during marathon gaming sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Eivk88r5jZGw3zBbfsn9PK" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-15.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo with Pixel 8 Pro docked to the controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eivk88r5jZGw3zBbfsn9PK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The G8 Galileo is available in a grey color scheme, and it looks decent enough in its own right. The faceplate is attached magnetically to the controller, and is easily detachable. But seeing as how the brand doesn&apos;t sell faceplate designs (yet), you don&apos;t get much in the way of customization. What you do get is a choice of three thumbsticks — short, tall, and dome — and you can easily switch these out as needed.</p>

<p>Slotting in a phone is pretty straightforward; the G8 Galileo has an extensible design with the left side stretching outward, and while GameSir says the controller can accommodate phones with large camera modules, that isn&apos;t the case. Most 2024 phones had an issue with the fit; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> jutted out as there just wasn&apos;t enough clearance for their camera housings.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> slotted into the G8 Galileo without any issues, so I used the controller with these phones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> would have been an ideal choice, but as its USB-C port isn&apos;t centered, it just looked awkward when attached to the controller.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bCuwKz5kqH5YFuH3xJNazJ" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-18.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo side view showing iPhone 15 Pro Max fitting with case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCuwKz5kqH5YFuH3xJNazJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cases aren&apos;t a problem, as long as they&apos;re not rugged; I use a case with my Pixel 8 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and there was enough clearance to fit both phones comfortably. My favorite feature is the pivoting USB-C port; it just allows you to slot in a phone with a minimum of hassle, and there&apos;s no worry of the port snagging on a phone when you take it out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3knMhmhwW6NxkbFL6vGKPN" name="gamesir-g8-galileo-22.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Galileo next to Scuf Instinct Pro and GameSir X3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3knMhmhwW6NxkbFL6vGKPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there&apos;s clearly a lot to like on the design side of things, the G8 Galileo isn&apos;t geared for portability. The mobile controller is just too big, and unlike other GameSir controllers, you don&apos;t get a hard shell carrying case — that obviously hinders its usability outside the house.</p>

<p>The best thing about the G8 Galileo is that it is just like an Xbox controller in daily use, and that gives it a distinct edge. Most mobile controllers I used to this point had smaller buttons and triggers, and that gets annoying really fast. Thankfully, that just isn&apos;t an issue with the G8 Galileo, and it is just as comfortable as a regular controller.</p>

<p>The buttons have great tactility and feedback, and the triggers have a good range of motion. The textured back design makes holding and using the controller easier, and even though it gets heavy once you add a phone, it isn&apos;t too uncomfortable even with extended gaming sessions.</p>

<p>What I also like is that it has paddles at the back, and they&apos;re easily configurable; you don&apos;t need to do fiddle with the software. There&apos;s no drift issues with the hall effect thumbsticks, and even with extended use, they held up just fine — there are no problems in this area. If the bundled thumbsticks aren&apos;t to your liking, you get different-sized options in the package, and it&apos;s easy to switch them out.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a 3.5mm jack on the controller as well, and it allows you to easily plug in IEMs. Another useful addition is pass-through charging; you can charge your phone by plugging in the charger to the USB-C port located on the side of the G8 Galileo.</p>

<p>The G8 Galileo is terrific in daily use; it automatically works in titles that can be played with a controller, and there&apos;s no latency whatsoever — as you&apos;d imagine. The biggest differentiator is the larger size, and it allows the controller to be comfortable even after extended gaming sessions. In fact, it&apos;s for this reason that I ended up playing a lot more than I thought I would via my phone.</p><p>If you prefer cloud gaming, the G8 Galileo integrates with GeForce Now and Amazon Luna. I tested it with Steam Link, and there were no problems.</p>

<p>The Backbone One is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best mobile controllers</a> around. It is on the smaller side and is easier to take on the road, but you miss out on full-size buttons, and there are no paddles on the back. And at $99, it isn&apos;t as affordable as the G8 Galileo.</p><p>I use Scuf&apos;s controllers extensively, and the brand just rolled out its first mobile controller, dubbed Nomad. It connects over Bluetooth 5.0 and is designed to be used with iPhones, and like the G8 Galileo, it has full-size triggers and thumbsticks. Coming in at $99, it is costlier, but if it&apos;s anything like the Reflex or Instinct controllers, it should be fabulous.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a mobile controller with great build quality</li><li>You need a controller that's extremely comfortable</li><li>You need a plug-and-play device that doesn't need any tinkering</li><li>You need hall effect thumbsticks</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a portable mobile controller</li><li>You have a phone with an oversized camera island</li></ul>
<p>As I said at the beginning, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to this category in the past, but GameSir&apos;s G8 Galileo delivers everything I need in a mobile controller. The size is just right; it is large enough to get a comfortable grip, and the buttons and thumbsticks are terrific.</p><p>Passthrough charging and the addition of a 3.5mm port make it just that little more versatile, and I like the pivoting USB-C connector — I paired the controller with a lot of phones, and I wasn&apos;t worried about the port damaging any device. The only quibble is that it doesn&apos;t work with phones that have sizeable cameras, and that&apos;s most high-end phones these days. That said, it wasn&apos;t an issue with the Pixel 8 Pro or the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with the build quality either in the six months I used the G8 Galileo, and while it isn&apos;t as easily portable as GameSir&apos;s other products, it is one of the best mobile controllers around.</p>

<hr>
<p>One thing that became clear at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O</a> is that Google wants to make AI one of Android&apos;s main focuses. There are a handful of Android features that are already available on existing phones with cloud processing, and more are coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. However, on-device AI processing is the end goal, and Gemini Nano is the key. Moving crucial AI processes on-device can improve speed and security, among other benefits. That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> and the entire Samsung Galaxy S24 shipped with at least a few on-device AI features. </p><p>Google caused a stir when it explained that the Pixel 8 would not get Gemini Nano, the company&apos;s smallest AI model designed for mobile use. At the time, it said that there were "hardware limitations" that prevented the Pixel 8 from running Gemini Nano well. Since both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and Pixel 8 Pro are powered by the Tensor G3 system-on-a-chip, that may have been perplexing to some. It also came on the heels of Google touting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-8-pro-seven-android-os-updates-game-changer">seven-year software update promise</a> for the Pixel 8 series. </p><p>Eventually, Google reversed course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">saying in March</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini Nano</a> would come to the Pixel 8 as an opt-in feature. That&apos;s now right around the corner as Google prepares the June update for Pixels. This update could come as soon as next week and will bring Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a. However, ahead of this move, Google is updating Android AICore to add a toggle specifically for generative AI features on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini Nano is about to roll out to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a, as promised! One Pixel 8 user informed me today that they now have an "enable on-device GenAI Features" toggle under Settings > System > Developer options > AICore Settings. This toggle "enable[s] GenAI features… pic.twitter.com/PE3RuqIX45<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1795903720686772393">May 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Originally, the AICore settings page for Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a had an option called <strong>Enable AICore Persistent</strong>, which allows "AICore to carve out memory and run persistently." This has been replaced by a new toggle, as one user running <strong>version 0.release.pixel8.636144055 of AICore</strong> told Mishaal Rahman. The updated toggle is <strong>Enable on-device GenAI Features</strong>, and will "enable GenAI features that will run through AICore, using Gemini."</p><p>The toggle is disabled by default, and this aligns with Google&apos;s prior comments that Gemini Nano would come to the remaining Pixel 8 devices as an optional setting. Although this AICore setting doesn&apos;t specifically mention Gemini Nano, it&apos;s a huge sign that the model is being readied for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a, as promised. Right now, it isn&apos;t clear whether the <strong>Enable on-device GenAI Features</strong> toggle is showing up for Pixel 8a users as well or if it&apos;s limited to the Pixel 8 for now. </p><p>While it&apos;s great that Google seems to have figured out how to support Gemini Nano throughout the entire Pixel 8 series, the rocky road that led us here might foreshadow more troubles as smartphones age. </p>

<p>Google didn&apos;t specifically elaborate on what "hardware limitation" prevented the Pixel 8 from running Gemini Nano, but it isn&apos;t hard to figure out the issue. Both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro use the Tensor G3 SoC for processing, and the main hardware difference is the amount of RAM. The Pixel 8 Pro has 12GB of RAM, while the regular Pixel 8 (and later the budget Pixel 8a) only has 8GB. Since artificial intelligence features demand a lot of memory, this is likely the reason Google was wary of giving Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8. </p><p>However, the base-model Galaxy S24 also has 8GB of RAM, and it still has on-device AI features. One of those is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a> in Google Messages, which uses the Galaxy S24&apos;s on-device compute. Of course, the Galaxy S24 uses a different SoC, but it&apos;s still an example of a base-model flagship being able to make use of the latest AI features. Now that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a are getting Gemini Nano, it&apos;ll make those phones more equivalent to the Pixel 8 Pro in AI performance. </p>

<p>It&apos;s difficult to completely fault Google for the delay in bringing Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8. If the phone wasn&apos;t able to use Gemini Nano without inhibiting performance, letting these devices have it anyway would create a worse experience. Giving users the choice of whether to use Gemini Nano or not following the June update is the best of both scenarios. </p><p>However, the drawn-out process of bringing Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8 once again brings up the central question of this year&apos;s launch: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">why would Google promise seven years of updates?</a> Gemini Nano is the smallest Gemini model ever created, and it&apos;ll likely <em>remain</em> the smallest Gemini model forever. AI models are becoming bigger — not smaller — and it&apos;s almost a certainty that the next iteration of Gemini Nano will be larger. If the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a could barely run Gemini Nano, the hopes of these devices running newer AI models and gaining future on-device features seem slim.</p><p>That&apos;s the problem with the seven-year promise for software updates, especially on the Pixel 8a and Pixel 8. The viability of using a phone for seven years and still getting a great experience the entire way is still pretty unproven on Android. You could make the case that the Pixel 8 didn&apos;t get the entire experience in year one, so that doesn&apos;t bode well for what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-android-21-look-like-on-pixel-8">year seven might look like</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following a truly odd experience with Google&apos;s AI Overview results last week, the company&apos;s Head of Search, Liz Reid, is trying to clear the air.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Reid touched on the strange and down-right false answers that Google&apos;s AI-powered Search results provided users. Reid stated that while some of the odd responses users posted on social media were false screenshots, others truly occurred. The answers people received were attributed to "queries that people don’t commonly do" — and therein lay the problem.</p><p>It&apos;s because of this problem that Google is going back into the kitchen and taking a hard look at how its AI interprets "nonsensical" and "satirical" queries.</p><p>Reid used one example that popped up everywhere: "How many rocks should I eat?" While no one in their right mind would do such a thing, the AI doesn&apos;t really know that. It&apos;s simply fulfilling a query. The company&apos;s Search lead stated that since there isn&apos;t much data on the internet to "seriously contemplate" such a question, it&apos;s turned into an "information gap."</p><p>So, what happened is that the AI did its best to answer the question and ended up pulling an internet troll&apos;s answer to an outrageous question. Reid added that the AI also pulled sarcastic information from forum sites (think Reddit) about using glue to stick cheese on a pizza.</p><p>Google is working on fixing its AI Overviews on a broad scale rather than condensing the issues down to a singular, random query. Reid informs that the company has started building better detection systems for those nonsensical queries and "limited the inclusion of satire and humor content." Another parameter includes a limit on how much "user-generated" content the AI takes into consideration.</p><p>For health and important news stories, Google remains adamant about not displaying AI Overviews to preserve the facts and authenticity of available information.</p>

<p>Google Search&apos;s AI pulls information from all across the internet, which can be a problem when there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">trolls and shitposters around</a>. Hopefully, with the company reiterating its encouragement of user feedback, these problems will slowly begin to reduce. We may not be at a point where it&apos;s completely zero but, hopefully, more facts start going around than fiction.</p><p>Moreover, this problem with AI Overviews came a couple of weeks after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">rolled them out to everyone</a>. During I/O 2024, Google stated that its overviews would arrive to U.S. folks on May 14, alongside some query adjustment settings. Typically, these overviews are a quick snippet, providing a user with the most important bits of information in a bite-sized piece.</p><p>Additionally, these AI Overviews provide links so users can do a little fact-checking to verify the bot&apos;s answer.</p>
