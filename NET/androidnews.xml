<ul><li>Meta is bringing Calm, Amazon Music and integrating Instagram stories with a new update to their Ray-Ban smart glasses.</li><li>These apps will be powered by Meta's Llama 3 AI model, giving users a hands-free experience without needing to reach for their phones.</li><li>The new update will be "rolling out gradually," according to the company.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta announced on Monday, May 2, it is adding a host of new apps to the AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, keeping mindfulness, music, and social media at the center of this update. </p><p>Just a month ago, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gained new "powers" with Multimodal AI thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama 3</a> model, allowing users across the U.S. and Canada to use vocal commands, share views on a video call, and have hands-free control over Apple Music. Now, it has added Calm, Amazon Music, and Instagram stories to the mix of the already existing apps.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-smart-glasses-amazon-music-calm-instagram-new-styles/">press release states</a> that Meta has partnered with Calm to provide its users with hands-free guided meditation, mindfulness exercises, and self-care content. This feature can be particularly useful for people who have to quickly access the calm app on the go, get a moment to themselves, or deal with a stressful situation.  Users need to download the app and say, “hey, Meta, play the Daily Calm.” Follow the on-screen prompts in the Meta View app to get started. </p><p>Along with Apple Music, Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be integrated with Amazon Music. When users say, “Hey Meta, play Amazon Music,”  the glasses will start playing a recommended playlist. Users can then control audio playback with touch or voice commands, all hands-free while their phones stay in their pockets.</p><p>Finally, could there be an update from Meta that doesn&apos;t involve their social media platforms? Now, users can post Instagram stories just with a voice command without pulling out the phone. After users snap a photo/ record a video, say, “Hey Meta, share my last photo on Instagram.”  It also allows you to click and post a new picture on the go by saying, "Hey Meta, post a photo to Instagram," which instantly will open up camera mode and click a picture of what the user is looking at. </p><p>Meta says that these updates to the glasses will be "rolling out gradually" to its users. However, it remains unclear which countries these updates will be available in.</p>

<p>On the hardware end, Meta is launching three new styles: the Skyler in Shiny Chalky Gray with Gradient Cinnamon Pink Lenses, Shiny Black with Transitions Cerulean Blue Lenses, and the Headliner Low Bridge Fit in Shiny Black with Polar G15 Lenses. These will be available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ca/smart-glasses/shop-all/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=ray-ban-smart-glasses-amazon-music-calm-instagram-new-styles">pre-order</a> in 15 countries starting at $369.99, including the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung plans to revamp the Galaxy Buds, adding a stem to make them resemble Apple's AirPods. This will be the company's first major design change since 2019.</li><li>The new stem design aims to place microphones closer to the user’s mouth for better call quality and to create slimmer earbuds for a more comfortable fit.</li><li>The redesign could also allow for bigger batteries and more advanced tech, such as AI capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Samsung is planning a big makeover for the next Galaxy Buds, adding a stem to make them look more like Apple&apos;s AirPods.</p><p>South Korean news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2024/05/23/DW7O5M2M3NEFRPX4YTSH2SED3M/" target="_blank">The Chosun Daily</a> reports (and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-rumored-design-change-audio-improvement/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> echoes) that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-development-rumor">Galaxy Buds 3</a>—both the standard and Pro versions—will ditch the current bean-like design for something more akin to "bean sprouts." If this rumor holds true, this would mark the first major redesign of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-earbuds">Samsung&apos;s earbuds</a> since they debuted in 2019.</p><p>The design tweak has a purpose: the longer stem is meant to bring the microphones closer to the user&apos;s mouth, aiming to boost the call quality.</p><p>Samsung has stuck with the same design for its Galaxy Buds line from the start, and it&apos;s often knocked for mediocre call quality because the mic doesn&apos;t directly target the sound source. Adding an AirPods-style stem could be Samsung&apos;s solution to amp up the audio clarity.</p><p>Another potential benefit of the rumored design is a better fit. The current Galaxy Buds can feel a bit bulky for some users, and the slimmer profile with a stem might address those concerns.</p><p>The rumored design could also free up more space inside the earbuds. This extra room might be used to fit a bigger battery for longer battery life per charge or to include extra tech needed for AI features.</p><p>Samsung has already packed some impressive AI capabilities into their earbuds, like live language translation on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, and Galaxy Buds FE. It looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-upcoming-galaxy-buds-with-on-device-ai">there&apos;s even more advanced functionality in the pipeline</a>.</p><p>According to the report (machine-translated), we can also anticipate a significant upgrade in the active noise cancellation (ANC) capabilities of the next Galaxy Buds.</p><p>The Chosun Daily says Samsung is set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-3-pro-case-spotted-rumors">reveal the Galaxy Buds 3 series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event</a> on July 10 in Paris. Along with the new earbuds, we&apos;re also likely to see the latest in foldables and wearables.</p>

<ul><li>iFixit announced that it is ending its repair partnership with Samsung, effective in June 2024.</li><li>The company states that Galaxy devices are too "glued together," making it hard for iFixit to provide the necessary parts consumers need without driving up costs.</li><li>iFixit will continue to deliver Galaxy parts when it can, however, it will no longer create new guides on how to repair Galaxy devices moving forward.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (May 23), iFixit announced that it will end ties with Samsung in June as the two companies&apos; goals regarding device repairability "do not align."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/96162/were-ending-our-samsung-collaboration">iFixit</a>, the company is ending its partnership with Samsung through its Repair Hub, which started in 2022. Starting next month, iFixit will no longer be a certified third-party partner for parts and tools to repair Samsung devices. The post states, "despite our best efforts" to deliver a high standard for self-repair, "we have not been able to deliver on that promise."</p><p>iFixit adds that it has continuously tried to get the necessary parts to local shops within reasonable price ranges while "the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together."</p><p>The company states this forced it to "pre-glue" batteries and screens in bundles, which drove up the cost for the consumer.</p><p>Just because iFixit is dropping Samsung, the company isn&apos;t giving it the cold shoulder entirely. The self-repair service will continue to sell Galaxy device parts when it can, but its in-house guides will no longer exist. Pre-existing information on repairing Samsung&apos;s devices will not be removed, meaning users can still return for help on past devices.</p><p>iFixit is remaining focused on the future, stating it&apos;s preparing to launch more parts for devices in more countries this year. The company is also moving to partner with third-party point-of-sales services so consumers can grab spare parts easier for repair.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung regarding iFixit&apos;s canceled partnership but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>While not through iFixit, our very own Andrew Myrick had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">a horrible experience</a> attempting to get a Galaxy Z Fold 4 repaired through Samsung Care and uBreakiFix. Of course, foldable phones have a lot more going than your typical slab phone, but the process of attempting to gain a repair broke it all. The issue (which was a non-functioning display) was worsened by the choice of purchasing a Graygreen Fold 4.</p><p>Samsung had parts for that particular color of choice on backorder. The company had replacement parts for a Black or Beige Fold 4 in stock, however, if you had Graygreen, consumers were required to pay out of pocket to get parts — even through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Care Insurance</a> program.</p><p>As iFixit cuts ties with Samsung over its apparent misaligned goals for repairability, the company is considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-publicly-endorses-oregon-right-to-repair-bill">Right to Repair bill</a>. This is a law that Google backs, with hopes that more OEMs will move to create devices that consumers can easily repair at home without much stress. Additionally, manufacturers hope to provide complete repair kits instead of just separate parts.</p>

<hr>
<p>A "reliable list" has reportedly leaked, detailing what consumers could expect from Samsung soon and later this summer.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1792657340929605751">Evan Blass on X</a>, the Korean OEM is preparing to pack these hot months with eight new product launches (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-summer-unpacked-hardware-lineup-leaked/">Android Police</a>). The list mentions items like the Galaxy Buds 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-3-pro-case-spotted-rumors">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, Samsung&apos;s next wave of TWS (true wireless earbuds) for 2024. Next, the list slides into other devices we&apos;ve been keeping our eyes on, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>Then, three upcoming Samsung smartwatches are listed: the Galaxy Watch 7, Watch 7 Ultra, and the Watch 7 FE.</p><p>We have roughly two months until Samsung is expected to debut many of these new Galaxy devices. Considering the range of products this list covers, the company&apos;s summer Unpacked could be quite stacked this year.</p><p>Blass briefly mentioned the Galaxy Book 4 Edge and the Book 4 Edge Pro; however, those laptops have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-book4-edge-next-gen-ai-pc-expands-galaxy-ai-ecosystem/">already launched</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to a reliable list, these are the only notable SS products on deck in the near future:Galaxy Book4 EdgeGalaxy Book4 Edge ProGalaxy Buds3Galaxy Buds3 ProGalaxy RingGalaxy Watch FEGalaxy Watch7Galaxy Watch7 UltraQ6/B6 https://t.co/5O3p2DNuu0<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1792657340929605751">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Samsung has no shortage of heavy-hitting devices, especially with its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring. Most recently, the device had its supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-us-price-subscription-rumors">price leaked</a>, which pits it in a $300 to $350 range, similar to the Oura Ring 3. That same rumor came with speculation that Samsung could kickstart a subscription service for its Health app, which might be "under $10."</p><p>The Galaxy Ring is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">also rumored</a> to arrive in several American ring sizes, ranging from 5 to 13.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-has-one-path-to-success">Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a> was rumored earlier in May, pushing us to expect a larger display and a better battery life. The device will supposedly arrive with a 578mAh battery, but more specifics are still unknown. Additionally, a cheaper Galaxy Watch 7 FE was reportedly discovered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fcc-listings-foreshadow-galaxy-watch-7-series-and-budget-galaxy-watch-fe">passing through the FCC</a>.</p><p>Aside from these devices, there are the foldables, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, which we&apos;re expecting this summer. Samsung typically waits for its second Unpacked to reveal such devices, so those will likely be the headliners. The company is expected to host its event on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini's YouTube Music extension is rolling out now for desktop and Android, with an array of prompts users can give the AI.</li><li>Users must make sure their YouTube Music and Gemini accounts are the same and hop into their extension settings to enable it.</li><li>Prompts include asking Gemini to find a specific music genre radio, songs by artist, playlists, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A couple of weeks after Gemini&apos;s YouTube Music extension was discovered, Google is officially rolling it out for English-only prompts.</p><p>Arriving as a Gemini extension, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13695044#zippy=%2Cexamples%2Cabout-your-youtube-music-watch-history">Google explains</a> that users can connect YouTube Music to the AI bot on the web with their account (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/23/youtube-music-gemini-extension/">9to5Google</a>). However, the company states this account must be the same for Gemini and YouTube Music. Functionality includes asking Gemini to "show, find, or play" songs, albums, artists, your custom playlists, and more.</p><p>It seems that the YouTube Music extension is disabled by default. On your PC or the Gemini app, hop into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/extensions">extensions settings</a> and quickly toggle the extension on to get going.</p><p>Users can give Gemini a few prompts with the extension such as "play me rock music radio," "play music that I like," and more. Google then provided a few prompt formats that users can use interchangeably with different music genres.</p>
<ul><li>Find [song name] by [artist name]</li><li>Find the album [album title] by [artist name]</li><li>Find [playlist name] playlist</li><li>Find [genre] music</li><li>Search for songs similar to [song name] by [artist name]</li></ul>

<p>Gemini can "play" a specific song when asked, however, it doesn&apos;t appear to be working on computers. Gemini returns with a "I can&apos;t assist you with playing media yet, but I can provide you with a link to the song on YouTube Music" response. The publication was able to play music through Gemini on the Android app, which produces the YouTube Music app.</p><p>Moreover, users must accept a few permissions before the extension can work. Google informs that Gemini needs access to your playback history, playlists, and preferences. The company adds via its support page that your watch history is stored "based on your settings" when using the new extension.</p><p>A lot was going on with Google and its adventures with AI during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a> keynote. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">highlighted several improvements</a> for Gemini, such as its faster 1.5 Flash model. This variant is said to handle "high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale" while being faster and lighter than the Pro model.</p><p>Gemini Nano for Android devices is getting a boost, courtesy of Multimodality. The company stated this will help the AI "understand the world the way people do." There&apos;s also a brand new wave of image and video generation technology entering the scene, thanks to Veo and Imagen 3.</p>

According to leaker Yogesh Brar and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-subscription-price-leak-3445434/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> , the Galaxy Ring could come with both a high initial cost and a perpetual subscription fee. Brar doesn&apos;t offer any concrete details, but says the possible subscription would cost "under $10" for U.S. users.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Ring as of now is priced at Rs 35k in India.US price in the $300-350 rangePretty expensive piece of tech..<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1793155170093969897">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It seems unlikely that Samsung would require a subscription for use of the Galaxy Ring, because there&apos;s no precedent of the company doing so in the past. However, if Samsung did tie a monthly subscription to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable</a>, it would continue a dangerous trend. </p><p>Companies want a slice of the cake and eat it, too; they’re trying to charge high upfront costs to buy hardware while requiring users to pay perpetual fees on top of that.<br></p><p>Eventually, we, as consumers, need to say that enough is enough. Using a subscription-model is fine, using an ad-supported model is alright too, and charging a high upfront cost is another option. Any combination of those three models, however, is downright unacceptable. </p>
<h2 id="subscriptions-are-okay-and-whoop-proves-it-2">Subscriptions are okay, and Whoop proves it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kaFKUS592UQxjQmXdXkjDP" name="whoop-4-battery.png" alt="Whoop 4.0 battery charger on wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kaFKUS592UQxjQmXdXkjDP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Courtney Lynch / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to hate subscriptions, especially as more and more products and services we use daily move to a subscription model. They really aren&apos;t that bad on their own, though, especially if users know what they&apos;re getting into before they sign up. A great example of a good subscription offering comes from Whoop, the health and fitness company that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whoop-40-review">Whoop 4.0 band</a>. </p><p>Unlike what Samsung could be considering for the Galaxy Ring, Whoop doesn&apos;t make you pay anything for the Whoop 4.0 band. The entire experience is centered around a subscription. As long as you&apos;re subscribed, you&apos;ll be able to use a Whoop 4.0 band for free. It&apos;s an entirely different situation than it would be if Whoop made you pay for the band <em>and</em> the service. </p><p>The other thing Whoop has going for it is a competitive pricing model and a unique feature set. The company is in the business of advanced fitness and health insights, especially those related to recovery. Using artificial intelligence, Whoop has managed to provide personalized insights and continues to add features over time. A subscription costs $30 per month, $239 for the year, and and $399 for two years. Considering an Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 flat, the Whoop subscription isn&apos;t that bad of a value, and the band is included. </p>
<h2 id="optional-subscriptions-are-fine-too-2">Optional subscriptions are fine, too</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hk5spapGvpEr5EKwEmJwW5" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Fitbit Charge 6 display showing the time and heart rate data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hk5spapGvpEr5EKwEmJwW5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Alternatively, having an optional subscription that unlocks advanced features is tolerable as well. Fitbit does this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> subscription. Just by buying a Fitbit wearable, you&apos;ll get access to all the essential features it is marketed as having. Things like heart rate, basic health metrics, blood glucose monitoring, skin temperature scores, and more are all included with your Fitbit device. The Fitbit Premium subscription adds advanced features like guided workouts, more comprehensive data, and wellness reports.</p><p>The key here is that the subscription isn&apos;t necessary to use a Fitbit wearable, and you can get tons of value out of a Fitbit tracker without spending a dime on subscriptions. It&apos;s fine for companies to give users a way to gain access to advanced features through an optional subscription plan. However, when a subscription is tied to a product&apos;s core functionality, and that product comes with a high standalone MSRP, it becomes unacceptable. </p>
<h2 id="high-upfront-costs-and-required-subscriptions-are-never-okay-2">High upfront costs and required subscriptions are never okay</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb" name="humane-ai-pin-lifestyle-camo.jpg" alt="Humane AI Pin lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qg7zgqqYynueYAgqoPHbsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Humane)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Galaxy Ring comes with a retail price of around $300 and a required monthly subscription, it would continue a dangerous trend that the Humane AI Pin brought into the forefront earlier this year. To use the AI Pin, you need to pay a whopping $699 just to buy the hardware and a $24 per month subscription every month thereafter. The second you stop paying for the AI Pin&apos;s subscription, the $699 device becomes a paperweight. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung can do one of three things with regard to the Galaxy Ring&apos;s pricing model. It can charge an upfront cost to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> with all features included, it can offer an optional subscription on top of the upfront cost, or it can use a subscription model entirely. However, the rumored plan to charge as much as $350 for a Galaxy Ring that you can&apos;t even use without a monthly subscription is outrageous. If Samsung goes that route, no one should buy it. </p>

We had already found a treasure trove of weaponry and some sweet new armor in this dungeon, but there was one chest left that we’d been waiting to find the key for. Too bad the chest had other intentions when we opened it. I’ve seldom screamed like that in my adult life!</p>

<p>Turns out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dungeons-and-dragons-meta-quest-vr-games">Dungeons of Eternity</a>’s latest update added Mimics, a fantasy creature that disguises itself as a valuables-filled chest and hides itself in the deepest dungeons you might try to raid. Once opened, the Mimic’s fanged visage is fully revealed, very killing the person who attempted to loot its coffers.</p><p>Finding this chest alone would have been cool enough, but there’s something special about quality father-son bonding time that made it significantly better. I cheered my son on as I dodged fireballs that emitted from the chest, and as we both went in for the killing blow, the high fives that erupted from the room were the kind some only reserve for the stands at a stadium.</p><p>It&apos;s these moments and countless others have helped shape the bond between my son and I, and I&apos;d love to encourage other parents to do the same. Even if it&apos;s playing a game that you normally wouldn&apos;t like, doing things together — especially if that&apos;s playing immersive VR games — creates lasting memories and a childlike sense of joy that&apos;s akin to when he was even younger and we would play with action figures or LEGO on the floor together.</p>

<p>There’s something special about gaming with your kids that helps bridge the traditional generational gap in interests and understanding. Gaming breaks down borders, but it can also be an unhealthy way to add more couch time to your life. That’s where VR comes in.</p><p>Most VR games are inherently more active than traditional games on a flat display because they force you to move around more, even if that just means moving your head or your arms. It’s better for your body and mind because you’re not spending another Friday night just sitting on the couch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Traditional games can encourage unhealthy habits, but VR games encourage movement and physicality in a new and different way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But VR gaming is also about more than just getting up and moving around a bit. It’s a way to create lasting memories in a way that’s unique to our brains’ ability to capture spatial information.</p><p>While traditional flat-screen gaming can elicit emotions and create memorable moments, our brains were built to experience things with more than just our eyes and ears. They were built to explore with our hands, to walk with our legs (or roll in a wheelchair), and sense the ethereal quality of being there with our presence.</p><p>When my son asks me if we can play Dungeons of Eternity, he speaks about it the same way he might speak about playing with his friends outside or exploring the woods. That’s because he’s going on a <strong>real </strong>adventure with his dad, slaying actual skeletons and undead wizards with the weapons his hands hold and his eyes behold, exploring new places we’ve never been (and can never go back to), and, of course, finding gobs of treasure as a reward.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>We love our outdoor time and get plenty of it, but VR gives us the ability to go on a real adventure in a way that the fully-explored real world sometimes can't.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It’s fun because we can experience a romanticized version of life together. It’s impossible to actually set out on “a medieval quest” — the one created by fantasy books and movies, not the plague-filled serfdom — because, quite frankly, nearly everything has already been discovered or done in some way, usually then recorded and rebroadcast over YouTube to be experienced in some cheap second-hand way.</p><p>So instead of just watching or reading about someone else doing these things, we’re able to actually <em>do</em> them and create lasting memories from the experiences. It’s the difference between simply observing someone do something cool and <strong>actually</strong> doing something cool yourselves.</p>

<p>My son and I have been gaming together since he was four or five — it’s hard to remember exactly when he started joining in for more than a few seconds — and we’ve poured our fair share of hours into plenty of games across a wide variety of systems. Whether it’s playing Minecraft cross-platform on different devices, leveling up on the living room TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/why-minecraft-dungeons-going-be-amazing-parents-and-kids">with Minecraft Dungeons</a>, or taking turns passing the controller in Breath of the Wild, we’ve made memories neither of us will ever forget.</p><p>And while I cherish all those times together, there’s something truly special about being able to play the same game together inside if the virtual world together. It’s a substantially more personal experience because you can see and understand the body language of the other person.</p>

<p>When we play in VR, it’s not sitting next to each other on a couch. Games like Dungeons of Eternity make it feel like he’s 4 again and I’m sitting on the floor with him while we play with stuffed animals and action figures, making a story while we make memories. It also feels like a way to preserve childhood because age barriers are irrelevant in a game.</p><p>Of course, I love time outdoors with him and we spend a lot of it there. There’s a reason I live in a mountainous area where we can still naturally explore. But there’s something satisfying about being able to still feel like we got a physical adventure even if we didn’t go outside for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kw6CRcYWdPQdLx2g8zFheA" name="dungeons-of-eternity-screenshot-treasure-chest.jpg" alt="A Screenshot of opening a treasure chest in Dungeons of Eternity running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kw6CRcYWdPQdLx2g8zFheA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you haven’t played VR with your kids yet, I wholly encourage you to try it! If you’ve only got one VR headset in the house, check out the best Meta Quest 2 deals and pick up an extra one for under $200. You’ll eventually have to upgrade it to keep playing the latest games, but the most popular VR headset of all time will still be around for a few years, yet.</p><p>Think of it as an early start to Summer vacation so you can take completely different adventures all throughout the week.</p><p>Or if that’s too much for you, just play what you have around the house. Whether it’s crafting and mining on two phones or taking turns passing the controller back and forth, I encourage you to do more gaming with your kids. It’s ridiculously fun, helps build relationships, and creates lasting, active memories. Plus, there’s something for every interest, so it’s not hard to find games that at least two people can love together.</p>

<p>If you were considering getting both smart glasses and a VR headset, now's your chance! Verizon is selling the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> in a bundle for $200 cheaper than what they would cost separately. Gamers will especially appreciate the huge stockpile of Quest games available for the platform, and it's a major upgrade from the last-gen Quest 2. The Ray-Ban smart glasses are easy to use, and this particular bundle comes with the Wayfarer green lenses.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/products/buy-meta-quest-3-plus-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wayfarer-green-lenses-and-save-200/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="43fb3cff-d90f-4492-8e26-801ebe048326" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99" data-dimension48="Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses: $798.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headset</a> available, offering a wide variety of both virtual reality and mixed reality applications. It&apos;s especially great for gamers, boasting super high-powered graphics for some of the most immersive VR gaming the modern industry has to offer.</p><p>As for Ray-Ban&apos;s latest generation of smart glasses, they offer a powerful set of speakers and microphones, a high-quality camera, and easy-to-use Meta AI features. For the most part, they look like regular glasses, apart from the built-in LEDs at in the corners of the frames.</p><p>What else can be said? If you were already planning to up your mixed-reality game with both of these innovative products, it&apos;s hard to argue with this price. Then again, it may not be worthwhile for you if you don&apos;t think you&apos;ll use the smart glasses, or vice versa. </p>

<ul><li>Google announced plans to make Magic Editor available on phones other than those in the Pixel 8 series last month. </li><li>For iOS and Android users, only 10 free Magic Editor saves are available monthly without a subscription.</li><li>However, Pixel users can access Magic Editor completely free, and it appears to be rolling out on older Pixels now. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google previously announced that it would bring Magic Editor, the flagship generative AI photo editing feature that debuted alongside the Pixel 8 series, to other devices. Now, it appears that users of older Pixel devices are starting to see Magic Editor in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/21/magic-editor-google-pixel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted. Although the Magic Editor feature is eventually coming to all Google Photos users on devices that meet the minimum requirements, Pixel users get exclusive benefits.</p><p>Most importantly, all Pixel devices can use Magic Editor for free. iOS and Android (non-Pixel) users will be limited to 10 free Magic Editor saves per month when the feature rolls out. To gain more savings, these users will need to subscribe to the 2TB Google One Premium plan, which costs $10 per month. However, Pixel users get unlimited Magic Editor saves included with their device.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-editing-features-availability/" target="_blank">said</a> last month that Magic Editor would begin appearing in the Google Photos app on more devices starting May 15. Users started reporting seeing the feature on older Pixel phones this week. Of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> have had the Magic Editor feature since they were released.</p><p>Older devices need to meet specific hardware and software requirements to use Magic Editor. These include running Android 8.0 or newer and having a 64-bit chipset with at least 4 GB RAM. As long as those conditions are met, you’ll be able to use Magic Editor on your device soon. It may already be on your older Pixel. </p><p>Here are a few screenshots showing what Magic Editor looks like in action: </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.21%;"><img id="atqqnHCoYBzEavfV8yTQLL" name="magic-editor-how-to-use-3.jpg" alt="How to use Magic Editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atqqnHCoYBzEavfV8yTQLL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="2244" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above screenshot, Magic Editor on the Pixel 8 completely removes the skeleton of a dinosaur using generative AI. We have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">complete guide to using Magic Editor</a>, and while it was previously applied to the Pixel 8 series, it will work with older Pixels that gained Magic Editor support. </p><p>Aside from using generative AI to identify, remove, and replace certain parts of an image, there are a few other things Magic Editor can do. The feature can move something from one part of an image to another, filling the gap with generative fill. It can also apply contextual presets, such as “sky,” ”golden hour,” and ”stylized.”</p><p>Pixels are usually the first to gain new features, so Magic Editor will likely appear in the Google Photos app for non-Pixel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iPhones soon.</p>

<p>If a user chooses to get only the ring, they’ll have to pay $299.99 as mentioned; however, if they decide to pair up with Amazfit’s other smartwatches like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">T-Rex Ultra</a> ($399), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-falcon-hands-on">Falcon</a> ($499), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Cheetah Pro</a> ($299), they get $150 off on the entire order plus three months of Zepp Aura, and six months of Zepp Fitness without any extra cost. </p><p>Amazfit wants its users to take advantage of the new Helio Ring, aided by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">top smartwatches </a>mentioned above, combined with the Zera app, to draw data from both devices to analyze better health metrics. </p><p>The Helio Ring, which boasts itself as “Crafted for Champions,” features a skin-friendly Titanium alloy build coupled with a lightweight design. It weighs less than 4 grams and is 2.6mm in thickness. It is also equipped with a 10 ATM water resistance rating.</p>
