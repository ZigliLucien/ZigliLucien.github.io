These include Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and OnePlus&apos; own baked-in apps for their branded smartwatches that run on Wear OS.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, for example, visit the OHealth app, go to Watch Faces, and then choose among the various options in categories like Classic, Utility, Workouts, and Live. You can even create a customized watch face using your personal photos. Sync it to the Watch then add it to the Watch Face and voila! You have a watch face that&apos;s literally unlike anyone else&apos;s.</p>

<p>What about third-party watch face apps? Facer is one of the most popular (and largest) offering tons of options for Wear OS watches (as well as Apple Watch and Tizen-based smartwatches).</p><p>Once you download the app from the Google Play Store, you can upload cool and unique watch faces, including official faces from popular franchise brands, like Star Trek, Dungeons & Dragons, or Fallout, real-time 3D watch faces, quirky and stylish ones from independent designers, customizable ones that you can adjust everything from the design to the color schemes, and more.</p><p>New ones are being added all the time, so you can feel like you have a new smartwatch on your wrist from one month, week, or even day to the next. Or change it out for the work or school day to something different at night. There are free options while some require a Premium subscription for a small monthly or annual fee.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Amazon is shifting from full-screen startup ads to static ads before the screensaver on Fire TV.</li><li>These new ads last 30 seconds to a minute and are part of the "Ambient Experience" feature.</li><li>Currently, this seems to be targeting US users with Fire TV models from 2016 onwards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After easing up on Fire TV full-screen video ads that played when the device starts up, Amazon is now pushing a new ad method using your screensaver.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/amazon-adds-full-screen-ads-on-the-fire-tv-replacing-your-screensaver/" target="_blank">Cord Cutter News</a> reports that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">Fire TV devices</a> now show static ads before the screensaver starts. These ads apparently run for 30 seconds to a minute, as per the report.</p><p>Amazon has since confirmed to the outlet that it is rolling out this type of advert as part of the "Ambient Experience" feature. At the moment, it appears to be targeting US users with promotional messages on Fire TV models made from 2016 onwards.</p><p>However, it&apos;s still uncertain how widespread this rollout is. Cord Cutter News is a reliable source, but the lack of widespread user reports hints that the pre-screensaver ad might only be available to a limited audience for now.</p><p>Amazon has been ramping up its advertising on the Fire TV platform. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">adding in-stream ads on Prime Video for non-premium users</a> and briefly using full-screen startup video ads, which were later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-eases-up-on-annoying-fire-tv-video-ads">toned down and made optional</a>.</p><p>The new pre-screensaver ads fit into this overall strategy. Here&apos;s hoping that Amazon will also provide a way to turn off these ads, although they likely expect many users to keep seeing them.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s move to add pre-screensaver ads on Fire TV is part of a wider industry trend, with competitors like Roku doing similar things to find new revenue streams.</p><p>However, the user experience must stay a top priority. There should be an easy way to turn off these ads since they can be pretty annoying when you&apos;re just trying to watch TV.</p><p>While ads in free or ad-supported content are nothing new, adding ads to streaming devices like Fire TV after people have bought them can be a bit annoying. Users who have already paid for the device might feel like their experience is being compromised by these new ads.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s upcoming Galaxy Buds 3 Pro features a new design that significantly differs from the predecessor model, and the same applies to the standard Buds 3. While earlier leaks have confirmed this, new real-life images reaffirm the new design.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will sport an all-new stem design, which is now evident in the real-life images shared by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1dvg597/galaxy_buds3_pro/">Reddit user</a> who claims to have already purchased them. Well-known leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1809037010524647663">Ice Universe</a> also shared the same set of images. Simultaneously, the Galaxy Buds 3 retail box is also spotted in another Instagram post (now deleted) (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_buds3_retail_box_leaks_new_stem_style_design_is_confirmed-news-63585.php">GSMArena</a>).</p>

<p>Firstly, the images shared by the Reddit user seem to be the real deal. They showcase the buds in a Metallic grey finish aided by a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top.</p><p>While they still appear identical to Apple AirPods Pro 2, Samsung seems to have differentiated them with little changes like the dual-tone finish, blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds, and even the charging case complementing them.</p><p>Users who seem to have had their hands on the Buds 3 Pro managed to connect it to the Galaxy Z Flip 4, and the connection seemed to have been smooth with the iPhone as well.</p><p>Until now, we have only seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-buds-3-stem-design-leak">marketing images</a> and the Buds 3 Pro&apos;s design being spotted via Samsung apps. Regardless, these new images turned out to be quite substantial right before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Unpacked Event</a>, scheduled for July 10 in Paris.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.90%;"><img id="9qpA95CCfm6pFeD5QhgEej" name="Galaxy-Buds-3-retail-packaging.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 retail packaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qpA95CCfm6pFeD5QhgEej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1156" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via GSMArena)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, as mentioned, the Galaxy Buds 3 retail packaging confirms the new stem design, which is not limited to the Pro model. The new stem element is a significant change in terms of design for both buds. </p><p>It should also mean we might likely be getting better controls and microphone quality, and new long-pressing actions are expected to control the music playback, activate noise cancellation, and much more.</p>

<p>WhatsApp Messenger could be exploring a new feature that allows users to create AI-generated images of themselves, powered by Meta AI. According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-14-13-whats-new/"> WABetaInfo, </a>the app&apos;s Android 2.24.14.13 update, which is available on the Google Play Store, shows that WhatsApp is working on this fun feature.</p><p>This feature requires users to upload one set-up picture that closely resembles them in real life onto Meta AI&apos;s chatbot. Then, the user can type in a prompt that matches what they want to see in their image, for instance, imagining themselves in a different setting or background. The tool will then create an AI-powered  image specific to the prompt when the user hits on "imagine me." </p><p>As seen in the leaked screenshot, the app says users can take photos of themselves once and imagine themselves in any setting, "from the forest to outer space."</p><p>This sounds a lot like a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/another-ai-packed-feature-could-be-on-the-way-for-youtube-shorts">YouTube is testing </a>called the "Dream Screen," which uses text-based prompts to generate AI images/videos that can be used as green screen backgrounds for Shorts. It lets people "bring their imagination to life."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s9Wdv2ewUiV8aKKBCLYmKG" name="Whatsapp-imagine-me.jpg" alt="whatsapp feature update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9Wdv2ewUiV8aKKBCLYmKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication states that the user will also be allowed to pull up this feature in any other chat by typing in the command "@Meta AI imagine me," followed by the prompt. The AI image will be processed separately, and the app will automatically share the image message in the conversation, keeping chats with users end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that this feature remains optional, and users must &apos;opt-in&apos; to access it. This means users who wish to use this feature need to head to the app&apos;s settings to enable it. Keeping privacy in mind, WhatsApp is said to give users full control over the images they share as "set up" photos, as they can delete them at any time through Meta&apos;s AI settings.</p><p>While this feature is still being tested, it remains unclear which future update will bring this feature to users at large and whether other users can upload pictures that aren&apos;t of themselves. Android Central has contacted Whatsapp on this, but they didn&apos;t get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article when we have more information.</p><p>WhatsApp has been trying to make its platform more creative lately by leveraging the power of AI. However, it is also making a few improvements to its platform that are aimed at video and audio calling experience.  Recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-highlights-calling-experience-updates">announced</a> that the app supports "Speaker spotlight," which highlights the person talking and moves them to the front alongside audio during a screen share.</p>

<ul><li>A new report indicates Google is significantly shifting with its Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL will likely utilize the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor instead of optical sensors.</li><li>It is reportedly the same fingerprint sensor unit used in the Galaxy S24 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is launching its most awaited Pixel 9 series on August 13 — a bit earlier than usual. The devices are expected to pack a lot of upgrades, including a new design language. A new report from Android Authority indicates an exciting new upgrade is coming to the Pixel 9 series.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-fingerprint-scanner-3456801/">According to the publication</a>, which cited sources familiar with the matter, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series will opt for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor instead of the optical sensor seen on previous iterations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. The upgrade includes all Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the debutant Pixel 9 Pro XL models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel Fold 2</a>, on the other hand, won&apos;t feature one; instead, it will likely opt for a capacitive fingerprint sensor incorporated in the home button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="YA4fAgCHL7XyxCVkTB73oW" name="google-pixel-9-rumored-black-color-stacked.jpg" alt="The alleged Pixel 9 in a leaked rendering." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YA4fAgCHL7XyxCVkTB73oW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1685" height="948" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91Mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the switch to ultrasonic is already promising, what&apos;s more interesting is that the unit that Google is opting for is the same one seen on the Galaxy S24 series, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Ultra model</a>. It is dubbed Qualcomm 3D Sonic Gen 2 (QFS4008). The ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on the Galaxy S24 series are already known to be quicker and more reliable, unlike the optical fingerprint sensors, which had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7-fingerprint-problems-odd-workaround">their complaints</a> for the previous Pixel phones.</p><p>The publication further notes that models starting with Pixel 6 have been utilizing the optical fingerprint sensor made by Goodix. While they did the job of securing the device, they often felt slower and inaccurate than ultrasonic sensors, and moisture on hands was also an issue while unlocking the screen.</p>

<p>Another annoying element of the optical fingerprint sensor is its use case in low-light environments, as it is accustomed to throwing light at you when the sensor is not covered entirely.</p><p>It is encouraging to see the Pixel 9 series finally ditching them and getting the latest ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, among other nifty upgrades. One of them is a brand-new Pink colorway, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-in-pink-leaks-again-in-video">recently leaked</a> in a couple of hands-on videos. All three Pixel phones are all set to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">unveiled</a> next month.</p>

Apple had been working on this tech for years yet, despite Google&apos;s years of experience in AR and VR tech, it seemed like the company was caught unawares and without a solution of their own.</p>

<p>Fast forward to a solid year later, and neither Samsung nor Google have anything to show. We&apos;re on the even of the big annual Summer Samsung Unpacked event, where we expect to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and the latest foldables from the company. But the one big thing we won&apos;t see is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR Headset</a>—currently a nameless product but has been called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">Samsung Glasses</a> in at least one patent.</p><p>Part of the reason is that Samsung allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-samsung-xr-prototype-used-exynos-chip">went back to the drawing board</a> after Apple Vision Pro was announced. The company was apparently planning something a bit different for its debut XR headset and wanted to be more in line with what Apple is now doing.</p><p>But the waters are dicey in the XR market right now and it&apos;s likely neither Samsung nor Google knows exactly how to push forward. Samsung Glasses are still happening, but a few setbacks have delayed its official debut.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-glasses-and-android-xr-2">Samsung Glasses and Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.86%;"><img id="kmqBBwunjFBFAwJnA2Vffk" name="samsung-flex-magic-leak.jpg" alt="An early leaked image of a Samsung XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmqBBwunjFBFAwJnA2Vffk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="395" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @PlayGamesMovies on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Paramount to the launch of Samsung Glasses—as I&apos;ll refer to them until we get an official name—is Android XR. While this version of Android <em>also</em> doesn&apos;t have an official name just yet, we know it&apos;s a custom version of Android that Google is building specifically for AR and VR products. In other words, it&apos;s the XR equivalent of Wear OS on the best smartwatches.</p><p>It likely won&apos;t be all that different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Meta Horizon OS</a>, in essence, as the operating system that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is also built on Android. The difference is that this will be an official fork of Android, while Meta Horizon OS bears more similarities to Amazon Fire OS, another fork of Android that also stripped out all Google services.</p><p>This last point is exactly what will separate Android XR from the rest of the pack, but it&apos;s also what complicates things a bit further. Development kits have already been sent out to a select group of folks and I&apos;ve heard through the grapevine that things aren&apos;t going as expected.</p><p>In a nutshell, developers are dealing with early development kits that are proving harder to work with than everyone hoped. General stability issues and bugs always mark the early days of software development— especially on new platforms—but some thought progress on these items would be further along than they are.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung can't make a headset without Google's Android XR software, but early development kits are reportedly unstable and buggy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>All of this seems a bit strange given how cutting-edge the Google Daydream VR platform felt back in the day, but since Google abandoned that project, it&apos;s likely they had to rebuild many things from scratch—especially given how much Android has changed at a deep level since that project was around.</p><p>I previously wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">Google lost its credibility</a> in the XR space when it dumped everything in the early 2020s, and it seems the company is trying to win folks back as much as possible by offering funding to get apps and games ported to the new Android XR platform.</p><p>That much isn&apos;t a surprise. All platforms do this to some degree, and it&apos;s an important way to help bolster an ecosystem early on. However, developers have not only been burned by Google in the past—leaving many to wonder if any efforts towards Google&apos;s platform even make sense — but it was also recently burned by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-pico-4-competition">Pico and its quick abandonment</a> as a Meta Quest competitor.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is trying to bolster its ecosystem by funding ports of apps and games, but it might not be enough to win back the trust the company lost in the early 2020s.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Android XR not only needs to be stable and work well when it makes its eventual debut, but it also needs to challenge Apple and Meta in a way that will make consumers want to choose its platform over the other two.</p><p>That brings us back to what&apos;s happening with Samsung Glasses. Recently, it&apos;s been said that Apple has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro/apple-halts-vision-pro-2-plans-to-focus-on-a-cheaper-alternative-heres-why-thats-the-right-move-as-buyers-balk-at-the-current-dollar3499-asking-price">halted Vision Pro 2 development</a> in order to focus on a less expensive headset. Samsung Glasses were already rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-apple-vision-pro-competitor-price-rumor">to be one-third the price</a> of the Vision Pro, meaning it&apos;ll debut for around $1,000 if the company stays on track.</p><p>If that&apos;s true, then it likely puts Samsung in a similar price bracket to a cheaper Apple Vision Pro. That&apos;s a good thing for everyone because it puts all headsets—Meta, Samsung, and Apple&apos;s—on a relatively level playing field. All of them would be utilizing similar resolution displays and will be powered by mobile chipsets—the current $3,500 Vision Pro uses a MacBook chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:946px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.45%;"><img id="3WofL2uvL46oMpkqhMiTjj" name="meta-quest-3s-leak.jpg" alt="A leaked promotional image of the Meta Quest 3s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WofL2uvL46oMpkqhMiTjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="946" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That would simplify things for developers looking to make the biggest return on their investment, likely giving many the ability to release apps and games on all platforms at the same time. The biggest hangup right now for multiplatform development is the lack of proper motion controller support on Apple Vision Pro, something Meta already does incredibly well, and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-xr-headset-controller-rumor">is reported to follow</a>.</p><p>But with so much up in the air, it&apos;s clear that Samsung just isn&apos;t ready to show off the goods until sometime later this year, at the earliest. Meta is rumored to launch a competition-crushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> at $299 this fall, which may further muddy the waters for companies like Samsung and Google, making it difficult to find a way forward unless either company is willing to sell hardware at a loss for the sake of ecosystem growth.</p>

<p>OnePlus is gearing up for a new product launch on July 16. It is dubbed the OnePlus Summer Launch Event and will take place in Milan, Italy. The company has started teasing it on social media, accompanying it with a teaser video saying it is a Nord product.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/summer-launch-event">teaser indicates</a> that it is a Nord product, nothing substantial has yet been revealed. However, OnePlus might launch the Nord 4, following the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-3-long-term-review">Nord 3</a>&apos;s launch in the Indian market during the same period. The company, meanwhile, has also teased it for the U.K. region. OnePlus also recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-lite-5g-launch">Nord CE 4 Lite</a> for these regions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tipster Ishan Agarwal has shared the first possible marketing renders of the OnePlus Nord 4, which, at first glance, reminds us of older Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 series smartphones. </p><p>While the color options look interesting, the Nord 4 has a dual finish on the back surrounding the dual cameras, and the rest of the device appears to have a metallic finish, which explains the teaser&apos;s emphasis on a metal build.</p>

<p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1808493070834692464">Abhishek Yadav on X</a>, the OnePlus Summer Event might bring many products, not just the Nord 4. We could also see the launch of the new OnePlus Buds 3 Pro next to the OnePlus Watch 2R.</p><p>The latter is likely a toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, launched early this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. The approach appears similar to what we have seen with the OnePlus 12 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. It could make the upcoming Watch 2R affordable for the masses.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds 2 Pro</a> got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> as a successor, per Yadav, we might see the Pro variant at the Summer Event. On the other hand, the Nord Buds 2 are also due for a refresh, and we may be likely to see them at the event.</p>

<p>Google Photos is updating to make your Locked Folder easier to find—now just a few taps away from the "Library" tab.</p><p>Before, you had to dig through the Utilities section in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> to find your Locked Folder, which was a bit of a hassle. Now, with the latest update, this hidden section is right up front in the Library tab, sitting alongside Favorites, Archive, and Trash. This change was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/03/google-photos-locked-folder-access/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> in version 6.89 of the Android app, and it&apos;s also making its way to iOS users.</p><p>This update also means that Locked Folder has taken the place of the Utilities button at the top of your Library tab. Google has already updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid" target="_blank">support documentation</a> to show the new setup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">Locked Folder is a secure vault for your sensitive media</a>. It&apos;s password-protected and hidden from the main gallery and other apps, keeping your designated photos and videos safe. However, it used to be a bit tricky to find, buried deep in the menu system and requiring several steps to access.</p><p>The goal of this update is to make accessing Locked Folder faster and more convenient. The web version of Photos already had the Locked Folder in the navigation drawer, and now the mobile apps are catching up with this streamlined design.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Utilities section has been revamped, with most of its features now available by clicking the "+" icon near your profile picture. This shortcut lets you create new albums, share with a partner, and import photos from other sources.</p><p>This seemingly small update is set to spotlight the Locked Folder, catching the eye of users who might not have known about or used this secure storage feature before. Since we frequently share our phones with people we trust, but not necessarily all our information, adopting this security tool is a smart move for everyone.</p>

<ul><li>The NFC Forum, which is the standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, announced its first preview of the next generation of NFC.</li><li>It's called Multi-purpose Tap, and it will allow you to use NFC for multiple things at the same time. </li><li>For example, you could verify your age via mobile ID, pay with a credit card, and get your digital receipt — all with a single NFC tap. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mobile payments are used everyday by many, and they&apos;re made possible thanks to Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. There are other ways to make digital payments, such as with QR codes, but none are as simple as using NFC. A tiny chip in a smartphone, credit card, or smartwatch can communicate with another chip in a payment terminal, facilitating contactless payments. </p><p>NFC started as a relatively niche tech feature, but it&apos;s now considered essential on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, iPhones, and wearables. It&apos;s even used in physical credit cards, since NFC  and tap-to-pay are more secure than an EMV chip or a magstripe. Skimmers — devices that inconspicuously attach to the top of payment terminals — can steal the information from an EMV chip or a magstripe. It can&apos;t intercept contactless payments made via NFC in the same way, and that&apos;s a big security benefit to using tap-to-pay. </p><p>NFC is just as essential as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or 5G in 2024. Now that the standard has grown, its creators are already looking ahead to the future. The NFC Forum is the standards body that handles NFC — led by board representatives from companies like  Apple, Google, and Qualcomm — and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nfc-forum.org/news/2024-07-nfc-forum-defines-next-generation-of-contactless-user-experience-with-multi-purpose-tap/" target="_blank">outlined</a> a first look at the next generation of the standard. It&apos;s called a Multi-purpose tap, and it will expand the amount of data that can be transferred with a single NFC tap. </p><p>The NFC Forum hopes to leverage consumers&apos; familiarity with NFC to eventually roll out multi-purpose tap without much changing for users. There will be more things that can be done with a single NFC tap, but ideally, the experience won&apos;t be convoluted for end users. </p><p>“Multi-Purpose Tap will bring even more convenience to contactless user experiences by making it possible for multiple transactions to be seamlessly conducted over the course of one single tap,” said Mike McCamon, who is the executive director of NFC Forum, in a press release. “Consumers and retailers love the security, reliability, and convenience of contactless payments — imagine also logging loyalty points or getting your receipt over that same instantaneous tap.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX" name="Google-Wallet-student-id-hero.jpg" alt="College IDs sitting next to an Android phone with the Google Wallet app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s easy to see the vision the NFC Forum is trying to make a reality with a multi-purpose tap. Right now, you can use a digital payment card with a service like Google Wallet or Apple Pay to complete a transaction on an NFC-enabled payment terminal. But if you want to earn loyalty points, you&apos;ll need a store loyalty card, too. Need a receipt? You might need to provide a phone number or email address or simply settle for a paper copy. The idea behind the Multi-purpose tap is that all of these common tasks could be handled by a single NFC tap in the future.</p><p>Of course, the main obstacle to the adoption of the Multi-purpose Tap for NFC will be industry adoption. There&apos;s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nfc-forum.org/uploads/nfc-forum-multipurpose-tap-v1.pdf" target="_blank">official document</a> that explains the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nfc-payments-becoming-completely-contactless">NFC Forum&apos;s goals</a> for the new standard, but the details are yet to be refined. This application for NFC might not require new hardware for the devices making contactless payments, like credit cards or phones. However, it seems hard to believe that payment terminals and point-of-sale software won&apos;t need to be upgraded to support this functionality. Getting businesses and governments on board may be tricky because this kind of hardware isn&apos;t cheap. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.68%;"><img id="F2yJVXYFR4wsV38EmhVZak" name="Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 1.14.45 AM.png" alt="The NFC Forum explanation for multi-purpose tap." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F2yJVXYFR4wsV38EmhVZak.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2282" height="1362" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NFC Forum)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, Multi-purpose Tap is in its early stages, and we have no idea when it might become available for consumers. It does appear poised to solve a unique problem that will start affecting NFC and mobile wallets soon, though. </p>
<h2 id="why-this-feels-like-the-natural-next-step-for-nfc-2">Why this feels like the natural next step for NFC</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mobile wallets, like Google Wallet and Apple Wallet, are constantly expanding and adding support for new types of cards, passes, and features. Their functionality is so robust that some people don&apos;t need to carry physical wallets anymore. In some states, a digital driver&apos;s license is acceptable as a form of ID. Throw in credit cards, loyalty cards, and boarding passes, and it&apos;s possible that mobile wallets are overwhelmed.  </p><p>The bottom line is that while digitizing one part of your wallet is great, digitizing the whole thing isn&apos;t as convenient. For example, if you need to board a flight and your ID and boarding pass are both in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>, it&apos;ll take you two NFC taps and a bit of navigation to get through airport security. The same goes for if you need to verify your age before making a purchase. Using digital cards and passes in Google Wallet isn&apos;t as convenient if it takes multiple taps. </p><p>That&apos;s precisely the problem that Multi-purpose Tap is trying to get ahead of. Imagine tapping your phone on a payment terminal, verifying your age, making a payment, and getting your receipt immediately. Imagine you&apos;re at the airport, and a single tap verifies your boarding pass and your ID simultaneously. Having too many digital Google Wallet items can become a nuisance, but Multi-purpose Tap would flip the script. </p><p>I&apos;m excited about Multi-purpose Tap, but I&apos;m also skeptical. It&apos;s mostly just a proof-of-concept right now, and there&apos;s a long way to go. However, if it ends up being widely adopted, Multi-purpose Tap could solve the convenience problem that is starting to affect mobile wallets. </p>

<hr>
<p>With the Galaxy Unpacked event merely a week away, tipster Evan Blass has shared new marketing images of the foldables—the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6—and they don&apos;t leave much to anticipate from the launch event.</p><p>The new set of shared images was leaked through his Substack newsletter, which confirms every possible spec of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> coming later on July 10 at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Unpacked event in Paris</a>. Per the marketing images, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is confirmed to be lighter, slimmer, and have a refreshing design with sharper corners than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodness will be widely seen across the interface, even on Samsung Notes, as the new Note Assist feature will be able to transcribe recordings, organize them in notes, and create efficient summaries. The large foldable screen is also poised to have a pocket-sized interpreter with two displays to translate in real time. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 users could also take advantage of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> prowess.</p><p>The marketing images further reveal the Galaxy Z Fold 6 cameras, which involve a triple rear camera setup with 50MP acting as the primary lens aided by a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera and a 10MP telephoto camera with optical zoom. On the front, there is a 10MP selfie shooter on the cover screen and a 4MP under-display camera on the foldable screen. Galaxy AI is further expected in cameras and post-edit scenarios to complement the shots taken.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 could have a more durable design than before as the hinge is getting slimmer. Samsung appears to be using "an improved Aluminum frame" and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for additional protection. </p><p>The other notable aspect of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its IP rating, as it now features dust resistance for the first time. It now comes with IP48 dust and water resistance, whereas the previous iteration only had water resistance with an IPX8 rating.</p>
<p>Per the leaked images, the prominent specifications include a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. The Z Fold 6 will weigh 239 grams, which is significantly less than the predecessor, which weighed 253 grams. It will measure 12.1mm in thickness when folded and 5.6mm when unfolded, which is again a bit less than the Z Fold 5. The foldable phone will also equip the same 4400mAh battery capacity as before.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>, an overclocked version of the regular SD 8 Gen 3 SoC. It will also have S-Pen support, which is rumored to be more beneficial than before. Users can further expect at least 12GB of RAM coupled with up to 512GB of onboard storage.</p>

<p>The smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing material also reveals the clamshell phone in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. The design, however, remains unchanged when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. </p><p>Samsung is also promoting the new interpreter on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which can utilize both screens to facilitate translation when needed. The cover screen will further benefit from the Chat Assist feature, allowing you to text suggested replies to messages without opening the foldable screen.</p><p>Again, the Circle to Search, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, 50MP primary lens, 12MP secondary camera, 10MP selfie shooter, and IP48 rating are the other prominent features shared along its sibling Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It will have mainly the same dimensions as the predecessor but a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. Also, for the first time, Samsung has incorporated a vapor chamber into its clamshell phone.</p><p>This set of leaked images gives us more than a fair idea of what to expect at next week&apos;s launch.</p>
