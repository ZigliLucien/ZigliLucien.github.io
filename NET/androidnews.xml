                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It&apos;s been almost two weeks since Hurricane Helene ravaged my hometown of Asheville, NC, and while I&apos;ve yet to get power back since the storm, I&apos;ve been able to keep all my devices charged and going with power banks from Anker, Jackery, and even Viture. Of all the ones I&apos;ve been using, the Anker Prime 27,650mAh power bank is the best value, coming in at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG/"><strong>20% off</strong></a> for October Prime Day.</p>
<p><strong>See all the October Prime Day deals: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></p>
<p>This power bank is massive enough to charge several phones at once with its three ports and kept our phones charged for days at a time, but it&apos;s still small enough to be able to fit in a bag to take on the go. I typically bring these along for work trips and they came in handy for a new reason during and after the storm.</p><p>The charger includes two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, each with a bevy of supported specialized charging speeds including ultra-fast charging on devices like the OnePlus 12. It&apos;s also got enough juice to keep a laptop running for several additional hours beyond its rated time, making it invaluable for working where you want (or need) without worry. It&apos;s normally $179.99 but you can get a cool $36 off just for buying it today!</p>

<p>Keep your phone charged for days with the Anker Prime 27,650mAh power bank, on sale for <strong>20% off </strong>during October Prime Day! It's even got enough juice to power a laptop and just about any gadget that accepts a USB charge.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/anker-prime-27650mah-power-bank-black/6556968.p?skuId=6556968">Best Buy - $179</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8fe821b5-f846-480a-b8b8-47b04c3b5320" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Prime 27,650mAh: $179.99" data-dimension48="Anker Prime 27,650mAh: $179.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You need to charge on the go, take regular trips for work or fun, or are just getting prepared for a nasty storm that could take power out for days.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a larger battery station that can power fans or other devices that need AC power outlets.</p>
<p>While it can also charge your portable game consoles like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, I preferred to use the Viture Mobile Dock to keep those devices going, instead. That&apos;s because the Viture Mobile Dock acts like a TV dock for these consoles, letting you plug a pair of smart display glasses into one of the three USB-C ports at the top.</p><p>That means you&apos;ve got a TV-sized replacement screen right on your face no matter where you want to sit (or lay), and it&apos;s 31% off during October Prime Day.</p><p>The Viture Mobile Dock tricks both the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch into thinking it&apos;s plugged into a TV, so you&apos;ll even get higher resolution options for running on your smart display glasses than if you played on either console&apos;s built-in display. They&apos;re made for Viture&apos;s own brand of smart glasses but I&apos;ve tried smart display glasses from companies like Xreal and they work just fine here. You can even use it to output to a USB-C monitor with the dock!</p><p>If you don&apos;t already have a pair of glasses, you can grab this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-One-Lite-Dock-Pack/dp/B0D14ZBL6B/"><strong>Mobile Dock and Viture One glasses bundle for 33% off</strong></a> during October Prime Day, knocking an impressive $159 off the normal price!</p>

<p>Give your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck a few extra hours of power with the Viture Mobile Dock. You can even plug a pair of Viture smart glasses into it to get a home theater experience on the go, plus all the benefits of docking your system like better graphics and higher resolution imagery.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Handheld-Consoles-Chromecast/dp/B0CG65NRPL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ef134cb4-0db6-4fa8-a9d8-6a7ff1042d0e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Viture Mobile Dock: $129" data-dimension48="Viture Mobile Dock: $129">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You love to play your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck on the go but don&apos;t enjoy neck pain associated with looking down for hours.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You don&apos;t already own a pair of smart display glasses. Grab the bundle that includes the Viture One glasses, instead. This battery pack will only add a few hours to your system, too, so it&apos;s not a great replacement for a larger battery system like the one below.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least is the Jackery Explorer 1000, which has powered everything from fans to keeping my Honor MagicPad 2 tablet charged during my extended time without power. We had a few hot and humid nights after the hurricane that would have been downright miserable if we didn&apos;t have the Jackery Explorer 1000, and now you can get that same level of comfort whenever you need it for 43% off during October Prime Day!</p><p>Normally $799, the Jackery Explorer 1000 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Explorer-Portable-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0D7PPG25F/"><strong>just $459</strong></a> right now. As the name implies, it comes with a truly massive 1070Wh battery inside, which means charging a phone from 0-100% will only drain around 4% of the battery each time. In other words, it&apos;s really the only power bank you need and it can do literally everything.</p><p>On the front, you&apos;ll find a pair of USB-C ports, one USB-A port, a car DC port (also known as a cigarette lighter port), and three AC power ports for any household devices you need. As I said before, I loved plugging a fan in at night to keep me cool, but I also used it for a handful of kitchen gadgets that make cooking and cleaning easier.</p><p>If you&apos;re really serious about getting one and using it as often as possible, I&apos;d recommend upgrading to the Jackery Solar Generator 1000 bundle. It includes the Explorer 1000 and an impressive self-standing solar panel array to keep it charged throughout the day. This bundle is 42% off — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Explorer-Portable-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0D2L1G66J/"><strong>that&apos;s $550 off!</strong></a> — during October Prime Day and is quite literally the only power bank you&apos;ll ever need to get through just about anything.</p>

I didn&apos;t expect a major discount so close to its July 24 launch, but Amazon is selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML"><strong>44mm Galaxy Watch 7 for $260 (21% off)</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>See all the October Prime Day deals: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></p>
<p>The 1.5-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is my #1 pick for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a>, not counting expensive options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> that most people can&apos;t afford. My second favorite, the Pixel Watch 3, is sitting stubbornly at $399 for the closest 1.43-inch display option, making $260 a steal. </p><p>No other sizes or colors are as cheap as the 44mm Green one, and we have no idea how long stock will last, so we&apos;d recommend hopping on this Prime Day deal fast if you&apos;re interested.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 has the fastest performance of a Wear OS watch, paired with dual-band GPS and enhanced HR accuracy to make it a surprisingly accurate option for athletes, not to mention its in-depth Samsung Health data like heart rhythm, body fat %, and sleep quality. It has four years of Wear OS updates to come, so you can make it last and get a ton of bang for your buck.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You want better performance, workout accuracy, storage space, and newer sensors than the Galaxy Watch 6 offers. You want better ruggedness and battery life than the Pixel Watch 3 offers.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You&apos;d rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/forget-the-watch-7-last-years-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-has-crashed-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-prime-day">save even more money on the Galaxy Watch 6</a>, which is a slight downgrade but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>about $100 less</strong></a> for its 44mm size. Or else you&apos;d rather get the Galaxy Watch Ultra for much better battery life, even if it&apos;s much more expensive.</p>
<p>Having tested all of the top Wear OS watches out there today, the Galaxy Watch series is hard to beat. The only reason I&apos;d hold off on buying the Galaxy Watch 7 is if you think you can get a better deal during Black Friday in a month. As it is, I don&apos;t think any other Android watch can match the Watch 7, even if it&apos;s more expensive. </p>

The 12R features a good-looking 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, an excellent back camera, and powerful performance that&apos;s hard to find at this price point. This discount is for the 128GB configuration, though the phone is also available with 256GB of onboard storage.</p><p>With an extra $100 off, its value is looking even more appealing, though it&apos;s just one of many phone deals available this Prime Day.</p>

<p>Amazon has launched 20% off the OnePlus 12R, a great value phone offering promising performance, a beautiful display, and a high-quality 50MP camera for the primary rear lens. Add in the long-lasting battery life and 100W charging, and you've got a truly strong contender for one of the best value phones on the market.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1f88c8e4-5851-4245-8586-4b0f7bee9a68" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$599.99" data-dimension48="$599.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>having a good camera on your smartphone is a major selling point for you; you liked the OnePlus 12 and want something with a large battery; you&apos;re looking for something that offers smooth performance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need wireless charging on your phone; gaming at over 60fps is a priority for you.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is a great value pick, especially at this lowered Prime Day price. We think it&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones#section-best-value">best overall value for a OnePlus phone</a> there is today, especially because of its balance of pure performance, battery life, and an overall good design with a great display.</p><p>Performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and 8GB of RAM, and it&apos;s flattered by the phone&apos;s beautiful 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. Plus, this phone offers an easy two days&apos; worth of battery life with 100W charging, offering a strong competitor to what&apos;s out there today.</p><p>The main downside to the 12R is that gaming is limited to 60fps, nut if that isn&apos;t an issue for you, then it may still be a top pick at this price.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You want a headset upgrade or are looking to get the best VR gaming experience today. The Meta Quest platform is the largest VR platform available today with thousands of games, great headset accessories, and incredible developer support.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You&apos;re looking to spend under $300 on a VR headset this year. Check out an Amazon Renewed Quest 3 or the Meta Quest 3S, in that case.</p>
<p>Upgrading from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3S to a Meta Quest 3</a> gets you a slimmer design, a higher resolution display, and substantially better lenses that are clearer and crisper Plus, adjusting those lenses is easier than on the Quest 3S thanks to the adjustment wheel on the bottom of the headset which lets you adjust the lenses even while wearing the headset.</p><p>Looking to save even more money? Amazon is selling the Meta Quest 3 128GB model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Performance-Oculus/dp/B0D5H6WRPH/"><strong>for just $379</strong></a> through its Renewed Premium program, which means you&apos;re getting a unit that looks and feels brand new plus an Amazon warranty to ensure nothing goes wrong when you receive it. Just be aware that the Renewed model doesn&apos;t include Batman Arkham Shadow and you&apos;ll only get a 1-month trial of Meta Quest Plus.</p><p>Of course, you can always pick up the Meta Quest 3S for just $299 which includes the same powerful chipset as the more expensive Meta Quest 3, just in a more affordable form factor. It&apos;s got the same controllers as the Quest 3, too, so you&apos;ll be getting better ergonomics and next-generation haptic feedback without spending the extra money on a regular Quest 3.</p><p>Meta Quest 3S will be released on October 15, 2024 and also includes Batman Arkham Shadow for free, plus a three-month trial of Meta Quest Plus granting you the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/746836817401205/">same 23 free games</a> as the more expensive Meta Quest 3!</p>

<p>Once you&apos;ve got your Meta Quest 3, head on over to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> list to help narrow down which of the platform&apos;s thousands of games are most worth playing. We&apos;ve made it simple to pick from your favorite genres and find something worth your time.</p><p>You may also want to consider a few accessories for your headset to make it more comfortable. I use these three accessories below and consider them must-haves for any Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S users. The best part is that my favorite head strap and controller grips work perfectly with the Quest 3S, so there&apos;s no need to worry about which headset you have.</p><p>Only looking to pick up one accessory today? I&apos;d recommend the BoboVR M3 Pro head strap first. It substantially improves headset comfort and adds hours of battery life to your headset with its rechargeable, magnetically hot-swappable battery packs.</p>

I used just over 60 phones this year (62 to be exact), running the gamut from the entry-level CMF Phone 1 to Honor&apos;s outstanding Magic V3 foldable.</p><p>What I realized this year is that there are no bad phones anymore — just bad pricing. Thankfully, Prime Day rectifies that issue to a degree, with plenty of terrific deals on the best phones of the year. The OnePlus 12 immediately stands out in this regard, with the phone delivering a striking design, powerful hardware, much better cameras, and one of the best 120Hz AMOLED panels available today. The phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Smartphone-Processor-Hasselblad/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL">down to $599 on Amazon</a>, making it a decent bargain.</p>

<p>Although it didn&apos;t launch this year, the Pixel 8 Pro continues to be a great overall choice if you need flagship cameras and AI-focused features, and it has a decent deal too, with the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">down to $719</a>. The mid-range Pixel 8a, meanwhile, is an at all-time low right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY/">coming in at just $379</a> — making it one of the best phone deals of the year. But I&apos;d recommend getting the Pixel 8 instead; it has a better design, great cameras, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0CGTD5KVT">you can get it for just $402</a> — just $23 more than the 8a.</p><p>If you&apos;re ready to switch to a foldable, the OnePlus Open is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad/dp/B0CHN8FNW3">selling for $1,139</a>, and that is a good value considering what you&apos;re getting. And if you&apos;re a Samsung user and don&apos;t want to switch to another manufacturer, the recently-launched Galaxy Z Fold 6 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18VM66K/">available for $1,399</a> — a massive $500 discount.</p>

<p>Yes, the Pixel 8a is a better value now that it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY/">selling at $379</a>, but I think you should get the Pixel 8 instead.

<p>I don't like the design of Samsung's latest foldable, and while it doesn't have much in the way of upgrades, it is great in daily use, and Galaxy AI has plenty to offer. The fact that you can buy it for $1,399 means this is a good bargain.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18VM66K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6651af87-9a4e-487a-8d19-e0be0e88f507" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (12GB/256GB): $1,899" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (12GB/256GB): $1,899">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I know that three of the options above didn&apos;t launch this year, but with phones designed to last longer, you just don&apos;t get generational upgrades on a yearly basis, and all of the phones listed above should last several years without any issues.</p><p>If I had to pick just one phone as my absolute favorite, it would be the Vivo X100 Ultra; it has the best cameras of any device today, the design is gorgeous, and it has one of the best hardware packages and battery tech. However, the phone is limited to China, doesn&apos;t come with the Play Store pre-installed, and even if you bought it via a reseller, you miss out on after-sale service, and that isn&apos;t worth the hassle.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a reliable alternative to consider. The device is available in over 30 countries, and it combines a great hardware package with a striking design, bright AMOLED panel, powerful hardware, long-lasting battery, and 100W charging tech. But the biggest update is around the cameras; the phone goes toe-to-toe with the likes of the Galaxy S24 in this regard, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p><p>Mid-range phones are better than ever, and while I&apos;d normally suggest the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> is too good of a deal to pass up. The phone has a glass back with an aluminum mid-frame, and it has better shatter resistance than the 8a. The hardware is the same, but the Pixel 8 is able to deliver slightly better performance in regular use. The cameras are better as well, and the device measures up to the Pixel 8 Pro — even though it misses out on a good zoom lens. The fact that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0CGTD5KVT">selling at $402</a> makes this a fantastic deal.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> has its share of flaws, but I really used the phone for a good chunk of 2024, and it proved to be a reliable workhorse. The hardware isn&apos;t the best around — it doesn&apos;t handle demanding games — but it doesn&apos;t have issues in daily use, and the OLED panel is much better than I initially thought. It&apos;s the cameras that give the Pixel 8 Pro a distinct edge, with the phone taking truly outstanding photos and videos. Yes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is even better, but with the Pixel 8 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Telephoto/dp/B0CGTJ12Z9">down to $719</a>, you are getting a much better value — and the same number of software updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Open</a> launched just over a year ago, but it is still a fantastic foldable. The sizing is ideal; you get a wide cover screen and an inner panel that&apos;s great to read and stream content, and the hinge has one of the smoothest articulations of any foldable I used. The crease is barely noticeable, the cameras have gotten much better thanks to software updates, and you get reliable battery life with fast charging tech. Now that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad/dp/B0CHN8FNW3">down to $1,139</a>, this is one of the most affordable foldables around.</p><p>Finally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is notable because it made its debut just two months ago, and Samsung is somehow discounting it by $500. That <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D18VM66K/">brings the foldable to $1,399</a>, and while that&apos;s still a lot, it is a better deal than what we&apos;ve seen in previous years. Samsung didn&apos;t make too many changes to the device, instead focusing on polishing the Z Fold 5. That in itself is a big deal, and if you prefer Samsung&apos;s phones and want to switch to a foldable, now is the time to do so.</p>

<p>Currently 25% off during Amazon's October Prime Day sale, Samsung's Galaxy A35 5G is a mid-range wonder offering a lot of bang for your buck(s). It's proof that quality and affordability can co-exist.</p>
<p>The Galaxy A35 5G comes with a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED panel having a 120Hz refresh rate. Helmed by an Exynos 1380 SoC working alongside 6GB of RAM, it can take care of everyday use tasks without any issues. There's 128GB of onboard storage, as well as a microSD expansion slot for keeping all your files and media. Running Android 14 (with One UI 6.1) out of the box, the phone will get up to four years of OS and five years of security updates. You also get a 5,000mAh battery, stereo speakers, and more.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV4NH5T9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="381a3fc7-9bbd-48f2-82c8-62f2ba208d33" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a well-rounded yet affordable Android smartphone with practical features like NFC, good ingress protection, and long software support.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you want top-of-the-line everyday performance, great cameras, and would rather have a phone that&apos;s a bit more compact.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy A-series devices are (and have always been) renowned for offering excellent value for money, and the Galaxy A35 5G is no different. Hands down one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones" target="_blank">best Samsung phones</a> available out there, the mid-ranger offers many features that are usually found in smartphones costing over two to three times as much.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is a well-built device with flat front and back panels, and a plastic frame sandwiched between them. Its 6.6-inch Super AMOLED panel sports a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, the Galaxy A35 5G features Samsung&apos;s homegrown Exynos 1380 chipset and 6GB of RAM. While this hardware obviously can&apos;t go against high-end flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, it&apos;s more than sufficient for things like web browsing, multimedia consumption, and even some light gaming. The smartphone also comes with 128GB of internal storage, and there&apos;s even a good ol&apos; microSD expansion slot thrown in the mix. Then there&apos;s the IP67 certification, which means minor splashes shouldn&apos;t be an issue at all.</p><p>Talking about software, the smartphone runs Android 14 (with One UI 6.1) out of the box, and thanks to Samsung&apos;s excellent update policy, it&apos;ll get up to four years of OS updates and five years of security patches. The triple-lens primary camera setup can take decent-quality photos and videos, and you also get a 13MP front-facing camera for selfies and video calls. All modern connectivity and I/O options are there, and the whole package is backed by a 5,000mAh battery with 25W wired charging support.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy A35 5G has its fair share of limitations too. The inclusion of a virtual proximity sensor is a letdown, and the third macro lens at the back doesn&apos;t do much. That said, for a smartphone priced this low, we really can&apos;t complain.</p>

<p>Powered by Google's very own Tensor G3 SoC, the Pixel 8 Pro comes with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. This hardware allows it to make quick work of even the most demanding of tasks with little to no effort.

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a feature-packed Android smartphone with amazing cameras, long software support, and plenty of AI-powered tools to play around with.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of games on your smartphone, or if you prefer the squared-off design of the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>It may no longer be the newest thing in town but make no mistake about it, Google&apos;s Pixel 8 Pro is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> you can buy. From top-of-the-line hardware to feature-laden software, it offers a laundry list of goodies. And of course, the overall design and build quality are arguably the finest in the business.</p><p>Gracing the front panel of the Pixel 8 Pro is a stunning 6.7-inch &apos;Super Actua&apos; display, complete with a resolution of 1344x2992 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone is powered by Google&apos;s custom Tensor G3 chipset, and comes with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of internal storage. Even though Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found the gaming performance to be a bit lacking in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, there are no issues when it comes to everyday usage.</p><p>The software experience is top-notch, and you get a wide variety of genuinely useful tools and AI-based features (e.g., Call Screening, Magic Editor) as well. Google Pixel 8 Pro runs Android 14 and is guaranteed to receive up to seven years of major OS and security updates, so this is smartphone you&apos;ll be able to use for years to come. Then there&apos;s the triple-lens camera system, which as expected from a Pixel, captures some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review" target="_blank">incredible photos and videos</a>. All modern connectivity and I/O options—from Wi-Fi 7 to USB Type-C 3.2—are included in the mix. Rounding off everything is a 5,050mAh battery with support for up to 30W/23W (wired/wireless) charging.</p><p>While all that&apos;s great, the Google Pixel 8 Pro does have a few shortcomings too. The gaming performance, as mentioned before, leaves a lot to be desired, and charging speeds are unimpressive. However, for a smartphone that gets so much right, these niggles can be ignored.</p>

<p>When my town was hit by Hurricane Helene nearly two weeks ago, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> was the only one with a strong enough signal to get messages out to let loved ones know we were OK before all cell networks went down on Friday, September 28. Even when networks were slowly coming back online two days later, the Razr was consistently able to get messages in and out while other phones kept trying and failing, and it made it one of the most useful gadgets to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/these-gadgets-got-me-through-the-worst-hurricane-of-my-life">during the hurricane</a>.</p><p>Motorola phones have long had the best signal strength of any brand, but it wasn&apos;t until this frightening time that I truly appreciated the strengths of this incredible phone.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You&apos;re looking for a phone that folds in half and fits perfectly in any pocket or bag, has all day battery life, and features flicker-free OLED displays that won&apos;t hurt your eyes even in dim light.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a phone with an ultra wide-angle camera or a telephoto camera that zooms well beyond 4x.</p>
<p>Aside from great signal strength, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is an amazing phone that folds in half and fits perfectly into any pocket, bag, or purse. The Razr was the first flip-style folding phone with a large outer display and it&apos;s truly a sight to behold when folded closed. It takes up the entirety of the outside half of the phone, with just the two camera modules in the bottom right corner, and it comes in handy in more ways than one.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s excellent software experience lets you use any app on the cover screen while other companies like Samsung restrict cover screen apps to a select few. There are ways to get all apps on the cover screen of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 but they&apos;re pretty clunky and don&apos;t work like they do on the Razr.</p><p>My wife often messages people from the cover screen without ever opening the big display. I&apos;ve seen Android Central&apos;s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, do this on many occasions, as well, and it proves the point that the cover display is more than capable; it&apos;s often the best and most convenient way to use the phone. I can also recall countless times when I&apos;ve seen friends and other tech journalists playing one of the many cover screen games that ship with the phone to pass the time, posting high scores online and challenging others to beat them.</p><p>But why would you want to use a screen that&apos;s half the size of the main display? Better battery life. In fact, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024&apos;s battery life is nothing short of fantastic and is easily the second biggest quality of life upgrade if you&apos;re coming from other flip phones. Historically, flip phones like the Galaxy Z Flip series haven&apos;t had the best battery life in the world, and while more recent entries like the Z Flip 5 and Z Flip 6 address this, those phones still don&apos;t get battery life as the Razr Plus 2024 does.</p><p>Motorola also uses OLED displays that are much friendlier on the eyes than the Samsung Z Flip series, sporting options to reduce flicker and block blue light. This has been particularly important for me as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> person as it doesn&apos;t give me a headache to look at the phone for any length of time.</p><p>If I had to chose one flip-style foldable phone to buy this year, there&apos;s no doubt in my mind that it would be the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, especially with this great Amazon Big Deals Day sale.</p>

<p>In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, Android Central&apos;s senior editor for wearables, Michael Hicks, said that the Watch 3 fixes most of the Watch 2&apos;s shortcomings. However, I&apos;d like to focus on one irrevocable drawback of the Watch 3: band compatibility.</p><p>We&apos;re now on the third iteration of the Pixel Watch. Launched in August 2024, this year&apos;s Google smartwatch came out a little earlier than its older siblings. The original Pixel Watch made its debut at at the October 2022 Made by Google event.</p><p>Three generations onwards, and support for third-party bands is embarrassingly bad. We were all dismayed when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">OG Pixel Watch</a> launched with proprietary connectors. Unlike Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watch series, you cannot use standard quick-release lugs with any of Google&apos;s watches. This limits most users to first-party bands. Just like the Pixel Watch 3 itself, you probably know how expensive that can be. Unless you get the Watch 3 on sale, for example, like the ongoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more">October Prime Day 2024</a>, buying it along with first-party bands could bankrupt you.</p><p>To everyone&apos;s dismay, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> continues to use proprietary connectors. People who want more variety end up using workarounds like quick-release adapters from no-name Chinese manufacturers on Amazon. Our very own Nick Sutrich tested them, and the result was very unreliable. You run the great risk of having the band and adapter pop out of Google&apos;s Pixel Watch connectors, which can result in breakage. Such a high-level risk isn&apos;t worth it for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-3-repair-lack-report" target="_blank">wearable that cannot be repaired</a>.</p>

<p>So, what gives? Why don&apos;t third-party brands work with Google to release affordable alternatives? Well, it&apos;s not like there are zero options. However, Google doesn&apos;t seem to have encouraged accessory makers enough as it usually does with phone case makers for the Pixel phone series.</p><p>For example, there&apos;s a wide selection of vetted third-party phone cases and accessories under the Made by Google moniker. But there are zero Made by Google brand collabs for Pixel wearables. This reinforces my belief that proprietary bands were not the right move for Pixel Watches. Yes, Google-made smartwatches are stunning and offer so many awesome features, but this lack of band support just might be a deal-breaker for many folks.</p><p>Not everyone can splurge so much money on a simple watch band. Third-party offerings almost always cost way cheaper than first-party options. This stands true for all accessories, be they watch bands, phone cases, USB cables, or chargers.</p><p>Spigen and its sister brand Caseology are two of the very few name brands that make bands for Pixel Watches. However, even their lineup for Google&apos;s wearables pales in comparison to what they offer for Samsung and Apple smartwatches. I reached out to them to look into why this is the case with the Pixel Watch, despite it being on the third generation now.</p><p>Spigen&apos;s answer was short and straightforward. According to them, there isn&apos;t enough demand for them to offer a larger variety of bands for the Pixel Watch. It boils down to sheer numbers, and the Pixel Watch community is relatively much younger than Apple and Samsung&apos;s wearable users. As the number of Pixel Watch users grows, Spigen plans to add to the lineup accordingly. This is probably what other manufacturers are thinking as well.</p><p>Until then, we&apos;re all forced to purchase first-party bands if we want assurance that the band will fit and lock in. There are plenty of cheap non-name offerings online, but none of them have great reviews.</p>

<p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">Google&apos;s first-party bands for the Pixel Watch series</a> aren&apos;t half bad, but they are very pricey. The Active Band continues to be my all-time favorite, and with the release of the Pixel Watch 3, the size and color ranges have been expanded. There&apos;s nothing quite like it, and I say that as someone who uses Samsung, Amazfit, and Fossil smartwatches on the regular, among others. The Active Band&apos;s soft fluoroelastomer is of unrivaled quality, gentle on the skin, hypoallergenic, and waterproof. I wear it almost every single day, in fact.</p><p>There are loads of other options from Google, but they aren&apos;t available in every region. Worse than that is the cost of getting one. The cheapest Pixel Watch band starts at $50, which is ridiculous for a plain old synthetic rubber watch strap.</p><p>It gets even worse because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/official-google-pixel-watch-metal-band-review">official Metal Links Band</a> is more than half the cost of the basic Pixel Watch 3. Let that sink in — $200 for a bloody metal band. The joke doesn&apos;t end with the nonsensical pricing because this mega-expensive band doesn&apos;t even come in all three of the smartwatch&apos;s shades. If you want a Champagne Gold metal band that fits your Pixel Watch, you&apos;re stuck with the thinner Metal Slim Band, priced at $180.</p><p>Why wouldn&apos;t they offer this shade for the wider Metal Links Band as well? And did I mention that the Metal Slim Band hasn&apos;t even started selling yet? At the end of the day, we&apos;re forced to buy bands from Google for unreasonable sums of money, and the band range isn&apos;t even inclusive enough. Hopefully, the Pixel Watch 4 will be enough to convince third-party brands — as well as Google — that we need more variety and cheap Pixel Watch bands that are guaranteed to work well.</p>

<p>Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 3 vs. 2</a>, the last-gen model has the same CPU, RAM, storage, sensors, water protection, battery life, and software. Mainly, you&apos;re paying for a larger, brighter display, improved wi-fi, faster charging, and more accurate heart rate. And that&apos;s all great, if you can&apos;t compromise!</p><p>But is it worth spending another $170, or $220 for the larger display? Since the Pixel Watch 3 is full price, it&apos;s far easier to recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, which has another two years of support.</p>
