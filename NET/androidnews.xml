                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sivga isn&apos;t a brand most of you will be familiar with, but the Chinese manufacturer is slowly gaining momentum on the back of wood-based designs and custom tuning. Of course, Meze did the same thing a decade ago, and the 99 Classics continues to be a standout product. I reviewed the 99 Classics last year, and it didn&apos;t take long to realize that it is one of the best-sounding headphones in the sub-$500 category.</p><p>Sivga is following in the same path, and the Luan shares a lot of similarities to the 99 Classics. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SIVGA-LUAN-Detachable-Professional-Audiophiles/dp/B0C6D7WY8Z">costs $299 on Amazon</a> — just $10 less than Meze&apos;s offering — and has dynamic drivers and a wooden enclosure that looks great. The key difference is that the Luan offers an open back design, while the 99 Classics is closed-back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6" name="sivga-luan-14.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll get to the sound in a bit, but as always, let&apos;s start with the design. There&apos;s definitely a lot to talk about in this area, and the Luan stands out for its usage of wood; most products in this segment use a mix of plastic and metal, and there&apos;s just something inherently cool about headphones with a housing made out of wood.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4" name="sivga-luan-4.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan is available in two finishes, and the walnut model I&apos;m using is sublime. Sivga did a brilliant job with the design, and what I particularly like is that the headphones are color-matched to the wooden housing, so the earpads and the headband have a similar color scheme. The end result is that the Luan looks striking, and the design is pretty distinctive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4" name="sivga-luan-5.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sivga also deserves credit for using no plastic in the chassis of the Luan; the headphones feature an abundance of steel for the swivel mechanism and the headband, and the build quality is exquisite. There&apos;s a good amount of swivel, and the external grille has a standard mesh pattern. Basically, the Luan doesn&apos;t look or feel like a pair of headphones that costs just $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5" name="sivga-luan-8.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wooden housing is sanded down and polished, and after two months of extended use, the Luan shows no signs of wear. The headband has a leather insert with foam padding that does a great job distributing the weight, and even though the Luan weighs 354g, it doesn&apos;t feel like it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7" name="sivga-luan-7.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a decent amount of swivel to the earpads, and they&apos;re lined with velvet. The pads are large enough that there&apos;s no issue with sizing, and the foam inserts are extremely soft, ensuring they stay comfortable even after extended use. There isn&apos;t a lot of clamping force, and while the headphones have a snug fit, the plush pads ensure there&apos;s no fatigue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6" name="sivga-luan-12.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan connects via two 3.5mm plugs, and the other end of the cable has a balanced 4.4mm connector. The bundled cable is of a decent quality, and like the rest of the design, it is also color-matched to the headphones. The Luan is bundled inside a hard shell carrying case made out of leather, and it is one of the best cases you&apos;ll see in this segment. It does a great job safeguarding the headphones, and it has feet at the bottom that allows it to stay upright.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5" name="sivga-luan-13.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Luan has a neutral characteristic that lends itself well to a diverse range of genres. The bass is detailed and fast, but it doesn&apos;t have the same rumble as other dynamic driver-based designs in this category, so if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, you&apos;ll need to tweak the EQ. There is good definition overall, but a little extension in the sub-bass region would have made the Luan that much more immersive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85" name="sivga-luan-6.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mids have a natural presentation, and vocals come through clean and clear. The dynamics are fantastic, there&apos;s good instrument separation, and the Luan shines with ensemble pieces. The treble has good extension, and there&apos;s a sense of airiness to the mix, and while there is some sibilance at times, it isn&apos;t overly harsh.</p><p>The soundstage is among the best in this class, and Sivga didn&apos;t really put a foot wrong in this regard. The Luan does a great job with detail rendition, and while I would have liked a slightly elevated bass, that&apos;s the only quibble I have with the headphones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7" name="sivga-luan-11.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, Sivga did a magnificent job with the Luan. The headphones have a sublime design, and the generous use of wood and steel allows them to stand out from other products in this category. There are zero issues with the build quality, and the Luan is extremely comfortable in daily use. One of the main reasons I used the 99 Classics is because of the lightweight design and fit, and while the Luan is heavier, I didn&apos;t notice the added heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94" name="sivga-luan-2.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound also plays a big part, and the neutral signature along with excellent dynamics makes the Luan a viable contender to the likes of the HD6XX. Ultimately, if you want open back headphones with a neutral sound and an eye-catching design, you can&apos;t go wrong with the Luan.</p>

<ul><li>Launched in 2017, the Google Play Security Program will no longer be functional after August 31.</li><li>However, researchers can still submit security reports, which will be addressed until September 30.</li><li>Google cites a "decrease in actionable vulnerabilities reported" as the reason for its discontinuation.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After seven successful years, Google’s Play Security Reward Program is coming to an end. The company recently let developers know about the decision via email.</p><p>Per the email shared by Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-security-reward-program-winding-down-3472376/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Google Play Security Reward Program will end on August 31.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is winding down its Play Security Reward Program, which paid developers who found and disclosed vulnerabilities in popular Android apps.More details on this program and why it's being shut down can be found 👇https://t.co/5UsW6qgknrTip @Techmeme<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1825448357298647362">August 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, Google kicked off the program in 2017 to encourage developers and security researchers to find vulnerabilities in Google’s websites, apps, Chrome and Chrome OS, and Pixel devices. Researchers who spotted and reported issues were rewarded with cash from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Though it did boost Android and Google Play security, the latest email to researchers suggests that’s no longer the case. It goes on to explain, "As a result of the overall increase in the Android OS security posture and feature hardening efforts, we&apos;ve seen fewer actionable vulnerabilities reported by the research community. Due to this decrease in the number of reported actionable vulnerabilities, we are winding down the GPSRP program."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH" name="google-play-security-rewards-program-email.jpg" alt="GPSRP discontinue email" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman/ via Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, the program will end on August 31; however, reports submitted before that period will be triaged by September 15, and final reward decisions are expected to be made before September 30. After that, the program will be "officially discontinued," the Android security team notes in the email.</p><p>The GPSRP was an extra step to gather vulnerability data and create automated checks. These checks would be applied to all Android apps on the Play Store to check for similar vulnerabilities and make the app store safer, even though Google already has its own set of measures to keep the Play Store safe for those many apps. Either way, it is about to end—for better or worse.</p>

The launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> showcased a subtle shift in the design language, with the chrome-accented design extending to cover the stalks as well as the driver housing. This led to a cleaner look, but what made those earbuds stand out is the sound quality.</p><p>OnePlus earbuds always had a distinct tonal characteristic with an exaggerated bass — so much so that the original Buds Pro drowned out other frequencies — but that changed with the Buds 3. The earbuds still had a good presence in the low-end and treble regions, but they had much better tuning, and that led to the Buds 3 having a distinct advantage over the costlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>That&apos;s the narrative behind the introduction of the Buds Pro 3. OnePlus is switching up the design of the case, and is rolling out sizeable upgrades to the drivers and tonal balance. The end result is that the Buds Pro 3 are the best-sounding OnePlus earbuds by a significant margin; they&apos;re not just the best that OnePlus made to date, but one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">best earbuds</a> you can buy today.</p>

<p>OnePlus introduced the Buds Pro 3 on August 20, and they&apos;re available now. The earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/product/oneplus-buds-pro-3">retail for ₹11,999 ($143) in India</a> — the same as the Buds Pro 2 — and they&apos;re going on sale in the country starting August 23. They&apos;re debuting at $149 in North America, and will go on sale at the same time. You can get your hands on the earbuds for $119, with OnePlus offering a $30 discount as a launch-week incentive.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-pro-3-design"><span>OnePlus Buds Pro 3: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VyDJN9FzcEcTLu4HjikYCN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyDJN9FzcEcTLu4HjikYCN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus hasn&apos;t changed too much on the design side of things, with the Buds Pro 3 featuring a subtle change instead. The glossy accents that covered a portion of the stalk on the Buds Pro 2 now extend all the way through the stalk and the driver housing, and it gives the earbuds a cleaner design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RUegZ7zBTAEqLdysdqLxXN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUegZ7zBTAEqLdysdqLxXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other key difference is the size; the Buds Pro 3 are larger than their predecessor, and while the driver unit is roughly the same size, the stalk extends out considerably. The result is that each earbud is a smidgen heavier at 5.28g (versus 4.9g on the Buds Pro 2), but even then, they&apos;re on the lighter end of the scale, and there&apos;s no fatigue whatsoever when wearing the earbuds for an extended duration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WtE9PBCrUrRijcUGH6ZYPN" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WtE9PBCrUrRijcUGH6ZYPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The earbuds are available in two color choices — Midnight Opus and Lunar Radiance — and I got the latter. The Midnight Opus model is the way to go if you want earbuds that attract attention, but both variants have the same glossy texture. As you can imagine, the glossy coat is prone to smudges, and I would have preferred a variant with a matte texture.</p><p>There are four pairs of tips bundled in the package, with the medium size installed as default. The fit is just as snug as the Buds Pro 2, and the buds stay secure in the ear even during workouts, and there are no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EfBNdvYgRwtsdnynRFAsrK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EfBNdvYgRwtsdnynRFAsrK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there isn&apos;t much in the way of design change with the earbuds, OnePlus overhauled the case this time. Unlike the flat designs of years past, the Buds Pro 3 are encased in a pill-sized case that&apos;s noticeably larger, and what&apos;s interesting is that it is made out of faux leather. Most earbud cases I&apos;ve used are fashioned out of plastic or metal, so it is interesting to see OnePlus take this route.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TQScW3qcYesTiq22VaQY4K" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-22.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQScW3qcYesTiq22VaQY4K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The leather finish definitely makes the case look upmarket, but the downside is that it isn&apos;t as pocketable. There&apos;s still an LED indicator, but it is now located at the bottom next to the USB-C charging port, and there&apos;s a pairing button on the right that lets you connect the earbuds to your phone.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-buds-pro-3-features"><span>OnePlus Buds Pro 3: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fgWC83n93tqLyhQ6CHcq2L" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgWC83n93tqLyhQ6CHcq2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus overhauled gesture controls on the Buds Pro 3, and there&apos;s a grooved texture at the bottom of the stalk of each earbud that serves as the gesture recognition area. Having a distinct texture makes all the difference in using gestures, and while the usual play/pause squeeze controls are easy to use, slider gestures — to control volume — are irksome, and I couldn&apos;t get these to register no matter how many times I activated the gesture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mxVEmPgq9RDZztB8ne3LbM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mxVEmPgq9RDZztB8ne3LbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The single and double press gestures trigger without any issues, and it&apos;s just the sliding controls that are finicky. That said, the gestures are significantly better than the Buds Pro 2; those earbuds had a limited recognition area, and gestures were so annoying to use that I didn&apos;t bother at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2VaESdVvR5iJU5p8u2nJBM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VaESdVvR5iJU5p8u2nJBM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus added IP55 dust and water resistance to the Buds Pro 3, and they&apos;re great for workouts. While the earbuds have ingress protection, the same doesn&apos;t extend to the case, and OnePlus needs to rectify that with the next generation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CpF4swP82atcAFxBZDRCVL" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpF4swP82atcAFxBZDRCVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big talking point this time is adaptive ANC, which does a more effective job at blocking out external sounds. You can easily change the level of noise isolation, and there&apos;s a transparency mode that easily allows ambient noises to be audible. On the whole, ANC is terrific at blocking out everyday sounds like the hum of an AC, traffic noises, or any ambient sounds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AUxAyjougWFbEVVARMkWsM" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AUxAyjougWFbEVVARMkWsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It did a decent job muting the sounds of my keyboard, and there&apos;s a smart mode that dynamically adjusts the level of isolation based on ambient noise. At the other end of the scale, the earbuds have spatial audio, and while I&apos;m usually wary of manufacturers offering virtual surround sound, OnePlus is using Google&apos;s Spatial Audio tech as standard, instead of the custom solution that was used on the Buds Pro 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9tuKRKxrp7mB2aNdUMm86P" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-21.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tuKRKxrp7mB2aNdUMm86P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mode essentially mimics a sense of space, and as the earbuds now use Google&apos;s standard tech, they&apos;re available on a much wider variety of devices, OnePlus and otherwise. Rounding out the features, the earbuds have a latency of 94ms, but there&apos;s a gaming mode that lowers the latency considerably.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4kTywLYDrKkFjNzAyJQpZK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4kTywLYDrKkFjNzAyJQpZK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Buds Pro 3 are larger than their predecessor, they house a slightly smaller 58mAh battery (the Buds Pro 2 had a 60mAh battery), and the case has a 566mAh battery of its own. It takes 70 minutes to charge the internal battery, and there&apos;s fast charging that delivers up to three hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><p>In my usage, I got just over five and a half hours of playback between charges, and that&apos;s in line with most other earbuds I&apos;ve used this year. With fast charging and the case&apos;s built-in battery, you&apos;ll only need to charge the case itself once a week on average.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="erYdpMu2X79mZLo263N3FK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/erYdpMu2X79mZLo263N3FK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Buds Pro 3 have dual audio drivers that include a 11mm woofer and 6mm tweeter, and OnePlus says it redesigned the woofer to deliver better accuracy, and the tweeter has better range in the high-end. Like the Buds Pro 2, OnePlus collaborated with Dynaudio over the tuning of the Buds Pro 3, and there is plenty to like here.</p><p>The earbuds connect over Bluetooth 5.4, and I didn&apos;t have any issues pairing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>, or the Pixel 9 Pro XL. What&apos;s great about the earbuds is that they have multipoint connectivity, so you can pair with two devices at once. That said, the biggest issue I have with the Buds Pro 3 is that they lack high-res codecs; you don&apos;t get any AptX or LDAC codecs, and that&apos;s annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KwhDXmiQMDz2zR94evYNYQ" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwhDXmiQMDz2zR94evYNYQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;re instead limited to SBC and AAC, and while there is LHDC, the codec isn&apos;t predominantly available in cast devices, so most of the time, you&apos;ll be left with SBC. LDAC has been standard on Android for just over five years now, and I don&apos;t see why OnePlus just didn&apos;t get a license to integrate it into the earbuds.</p><p>And as for the sound, it&apos;s safe to say that these are the best-sounding OnePlus earbuds by a sizeable margin. They still follow a V-style signature to the sounds with either end of the frequency boosted, but that doesn&apos;t color the mid-range to any meaningful degree, and the overall sound quality is among the best in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EiVS6yxpWSHdJgR6jC8PQK" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-24.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EiVS6yxpWSHdJgR6jC8PQK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a delightful rumble in the low-end, and the bass has plenty of energy and vigor. But it isn&apos;t anywhere as exaggerated as previous models, and doesn&apos;t bleed into the mids. The treble is also much more detailed, and you get clear highs with a good amount of extension without noticeable sibilance. The mids have good dynamics, and vocals come through clear.</p><p>On the whole, there&apos;s a noticeable shift in the sound tuning, and OnePlus did a lot of the right things in this area. You also get custom modes to tweak the sound balance, and these can be accessed via HeyMelody if you&apos;re using a non-OnePlus phone. What I like is the ability to tweak the EQ, and if you like a balanced sound, lowering the sub-bass and boosting the mids a little makes these earbuds shine.</p>

The overall sound is among the best of any earbuds, and they are a great value at $119. They don&apos;t miss out on any of the extras either, and you get the entire suite of AptX codecs.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P6XKFsWgDAyes6xx3dzzLL" name="oneplus-buds-pro-3-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P6XKFsWgDAyes6xx3dzzLL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need lightweight earbuds</li><li>You want powerful sound with good customizability</li><li>You need good noise isolation</li><li>You want IP55 ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need AptX codecs</li></ul>
<p>Overall, there isn&apos;t much to fault with the Buds Pro 3. OnePlus made all the right changes with the earbuds, and it&apos;s the sound quality where there&apos;s the biggest difference; while earlier models were squarely aimed at bassheads, the Buds Pro 3 have a much better tuning, and can be used across a variety of genres.</p><p>I also like the tweaks to the design and the case. The sound is inherently customizable, so if you miss the bass-heavy tuning of previous generations, you can make the requisite changes to the EQ. The earbuds are light enough that you don&apos;t notice them even after extended use, and battery life is great.</p><p>The only issue is that you don&apos;t get AptX codecs, but outside of that, the Buds Pro 3 are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">best earbuds</a> available today.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is bringing AI to lower-priced smartphones with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">7 Plus Gen 3 launched earlier this year</a>.</p><p>The Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 packs some of the AI power of the 7 Plus Gen 3 into a more affordable chipset, making advanced generative AI features accessible to more smartphones.</p><p>Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 introduces performance boosts all around. The Kryo CPU is nearly 20% faster, the GPU speeds up by 40%, AI performance jumps by 30%, and power efficiency gets a 12% bump.</p><p>By bringing advanced AI tech from the high-end Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 to this chipset, Qualcomm is making advanced AI features more accessible in the competitive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range smartphone</a> market.</p><p>These upgrades include better camera features, top-notch gaming capabilities, and strong support for various generative AI models like Baichuan-7B and Llama 2 with 1B parameters.</p><p>Cloud-based AI platforms like ChatGPT may be great for complex tasks, but they need a constant internet connection.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is one of the best flip phones you can buy right now. It has a high-performance Snapdragon chip, a new 50MP wide-angle camera, and plenty of AI features to enhance your experience. But as with every new phone you buy, it&apos;s gonna take some setting up, and even after you move your data over and swap SIM cards, there are quite a few things you&apos;re gonna want to do to ensure you&apos;re getting the best possible experience.</p><p>As such, we&apos;re going to go through some of the first things you should do when you get your new Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-and-set-up-ai-features"><span>Enable and set up AI features</span></h2>
<p>One of the main highlight features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is Galaxy AI, with Samsung adding even more capabilities than it announced for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. Finding these features is pretty easy since they&apos;re largely connected in one option in the Settings menu. Simply open <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai"><strong>Galaxy AI</strong></a>. Here, you&apos;ll see a list of the available features on the Galaxy Z Flip 6:</p>
<ul><li>Call assist</li><li>Chat Assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note assist</li><li>Transcript assist</li><li>Browsing assist</li><li>Photo assist</li><li>Drawing assist</li><li>Photo ambient wallpaper</li><li>Health assist</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll want to dive into each of these options and enable the features you want. You can also select just about any one of them to download language packs that will be used across your Galaxy AI features. This will be very useful for translation or transcription features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.61%;"><img id="ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-AI-Menu-One-UI-6-1-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy AI menu on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3440" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Below all of these features, you&apos;ll find a toggle that will let the Galaxy Z Flip 6 <strong>Process data only on device</strong>. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>, none of what you do will be sent to the cloud for processing, which some users may prefer for privacy reasons. The downside of this is that it may limit the capabilities of some features, or you may not be able to use them.</p><p>Beyond Galaxy AI, you also have AI features from Google, such as Circle to Search. You can activate this specific feature by going to Settings > Display > Navigation bar and tapping the toggle for Circle to Search. You can also enable Magic Composer and Gemini in the Google Messages app, as well as additional photo editing features in Google Photos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-customize-your-cover-screen"><span>Set up and customize your cover screen</span></h2>
<p>One of the best reasons to buy a flip phone is that you get to use the cover screen for various interactions. But before you do, we suggest setting up your cover screen just how you like it so you can prioritize the things that matter most.</p><p>On the Galaxy Z Flip 6, the easiest way to customize the cover screen is from the main display. Head over to <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <strong>Cover screen</strong>. From here, you can perform the following actions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Manage your cover screen wallpaper</strong>: Change to wallpaper to one of the preloaded options or add a new one, the latter of which gives you a large selection of customizable wallpaper options.</li><li><strong>Widgets</strong>: Manage which panels you want to appear on your cover screen. Many of these are first-party panels from Samsung, with the exception of Spotify.</li><li><strong>Notification options</strong>: Here, you can choose whether or not to show notifications, turn on the screen for incoming notifications, or set your <strong>Quick responses</strong> for certain notifications.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also worth noting that you can add multiple widgets per panel. On your cover screen, press and hold the display and swipe all the way to the right. Press the <strong>+</strong> button to add a widget and select the first option, which should prompt you to open the phone. From there, you can select which widgets you want and the sizes you want them in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-ai-to-change-your-wallpapers"><span>Use AI to change your wallpapers</span></h2>
<p>Changing your phone&apos;s wallpaper is one of the easiest ways to personalize your device, but now companies are throwing AI into the mix. Samsung began letting users create Generative AI wallpapers with Android 14, and the company continues to expand the feature, which now works on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3362px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.36%;"><img id="EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ" name="Creating-Generative-AI-wallpaper-Samsung.jpg" alt="Creating a generative AI wallpaper on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3362" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We have an in-depth guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">creating a generative AI wallpaper</a> on your Android phone, and the feature works more or less the same between Samsung and Pixel devices. Press and hold the home screen, then select <strong>Wallpaper and style</strong>. Tap <strong>Change wallpapers</strong> and select <strong>Create with AI</strong>. From there, you can choose between generative wallpapers, where you input options in preset prompts, or you can create Photo ambient wallpapers for your lock screen, which changes your photo based on the time and weather.</p><p>Again, both options are now available for the cover screen, but you&apos;ll have to go to the <strong>Cover screen</strong> settings menu to change your wallpaper.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-good-lock-for-extra-customization"><span>Download Good Lock for extra customization</span></h2>

<p>Good Lock is a very handy app for any Samsung Galaxy phone owner. It gives you tons of customization options, which can be a bit overwhelming, but after some fiddling around, you&apos;ll be able to drastically change the look and behavior of your phone.</p><p>You can download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> from the Galaxy Store or the Play Store. Once you do, open the app and select any of the modules to install. Be sure to read the descriptions so that you know what each module does. However, there&apos;s one particular module you&apos;ll definitely want to install, and we&apos;ll explain it in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-cover-screen-apps"><span>Set up cover screen apps</span></h2>
<p>Did you know you can use apps on the cover screen? Samsung does not promote this because it wants to focus on the curated widget experience, but it&apos;s possible, and there are two ways to do it. We have a dedicated guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">how to use apps on your Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a> that you should check out, but in a nutshell, there are two ways to do it.</p><p>First, you can access a select few apps to use on the cover screen through the <strong>Labs</strong> option in the <strong>Advanced features</strong> menu. Some popular ones are available, but unfortunately, they&apos;re very limited. Instead, you&apos;ll want to use Good Lock to have a much better experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.09%;"><img id="7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-how-to-set-up-cover-screen-widgets-with-good-lock-2.jpg" alt="How to set up cover screen widgets on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2595" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll want to use the MultiStar module in the Good Lock app to enable the use of other apps you&apos;ve downloaded. This will give you a new Launcher widget that you can add to your cover screen, and you can even rearrange your apps just how you like them. Once you do, add the Launcher widget to your cover screen and arrange it where you want among your other panels. Again, you can access the guide linked above to learn more about how to enable this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now you have access to your apps from your cover screen, although there are some limitations to this method, as not everything is supported. Still, it&apos;s a good way to use your phone without opening it.</p>
<p>You can also use this same mode in vertical orientation by just setting the phone down and pointing it at your desired angle. This way, you can easily capture some social media videos for TikTok or Instagram.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-flex-mode-panel"><span>Set up the Flex mode panel</span></h2>
<p>One of the cool things about having a modern flip phone is the ability to fold it at an angle, which can make it easier to watch content if your hands are tied. Samsung takes this a step further by offering what&apos;s called a Flex mode panel, which adds various controls to the bottom half of the screen. Among those options are a giant touchpad, zoom slider, split screen toggle, quick settings button, screenshot button, settings button, and brightness and volume sliders. When content is playing on apps like Disney Plus or YouTube Music, it&apos;ll also present a timeline scrubber and rewind/fast-forward buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can find this option by navigating to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Flex mode panel.</strong> When enabled, folding the phone at an angle while an app is open will present a small icon in the bottom left corner. When pressed, it will open the Flex mode panel. However, in the settings, you can have this appear automatically when you fold the phone at an angle, but you&apos;ll have to do this on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that some apps, like YouTube, provide their own custom layouts, so if you set the Flex mode to turn on automatically, it will override those layouts. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-easily-translate-conversations-in-person-or-on-apps"><span>Easily translate conversations in person or on apps</span></h2>
<p>The Interpreter app is probably one of the most useful in Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI arsenal. It makes it easy to communicate with people in person or over text, but there are ways to access either method. If you set up Galaxy AI in the earlier step, you may have noticed this as an option.</p><p>For in-person interactions, open the Interpreter app and set up the languages you&apos;re communicating with at the bottom of each section (or at the bottom of the screen if the phone is folded). On the top half is the other person&apos;s language, and the bottom half is yours. <strong>Tap the hamburger menu</strong> in the corner and the <strong>Settings icon</strong> to download more language packs, set up voice styles, and enable Tap to talk or Auto record when the mic is on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-translator-02.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 interpreter mode cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The three options in the top right corner of the main screen are incredibly useful. The first lets you flip the top half so the other person can batter read the text on your phone without needing to be next to you. The second option lets you fold the phone in a 90-degree angle so text can be displayed on the cover screen. The final option will display your history.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-chat-assist-translation-german.jpg" alt="Using Chat Assist translation on the Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3608" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about text conversations? Samsung has that covered, too. You can check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist guide</a> for a more in-depth look at how to navigate Interpreter features when texting, but you will need to enable Samsung Keyboard for this to work.</p><p>Essentially, it will automatically translate whatever you is typed in a chat, and you can set the language on a per-chat basis if you communicate with people who speak different languages. It&apos;s pretty neat!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enhance-your-camera-experience"><span>Enhance your camera experience</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 camera isn&apos;t bad, but it could be better. Its high dynamic range is lacking and can leave the sky overexposed in many photos. But fear not because Samsung has an app that can greatly improve things. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant</a> app is available to download in the Galaxy Store, and once installed, you can access it via the app icon or directly from your Camera settings, where you should see "Camera Assistant" as an option.</p><p>Once installed, I recommend enabling <strong>Auto HDR</strong>, which should improve the output of your photos. I also recommend turning on the <strong>2x crop zoom shortcut</strong> for an easy zooming option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are the main features I recommend, but there are plenty of options you should fiddle around with, such as the <strong>Quick tap shutter</strong> and <strong>Distortion correction</strong>. Take some time to go through the app to figure out what works for your imaging needs.</p><p>Also, there is one more thing you should do with the camera that isn&apos;t in the settings...</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and"><span>Fold the Galaxy Z Flip 6 90-degrees, and...</span></h2>
<p>In the camera app, switch to video mode and fold the phone to a 90-degree angle. The phone will open into a "hidden" Auto Camcorder Mode, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. You&apos;ll see that the viewfinder shrinks to the top-half of the phone with a minimal UI and standby/recording indicators. The bottom half where your hand will hold the phone, also simplifies the UI with a zoon slider, pause/stop button, shutter button, camera switch button, and flash toggle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.62%;"><img id="etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-camcorder-mode-UI.jpg" alt="The Auto Camcorder UI on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2595" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This UI makes it easy to use the phone like a camcorder, and your thumb lets you easily zoom in and out while recording without having to really move your hand. It&apos;s a handy feature for recording, as it allows you to hold the phone steadily.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs $100 more than previous generations of the Flip series. Thus, that gives you more reason to protect your phone with accessories.

<p>Following months of leaks and teasers, the Pixel 9 series is finally official. For the first time ever, Google&apos;s smartphone lineup is comprised of four all-new devices, including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It&apos;s the company&apos;s second foldable, succeeding the Pixel Fold.</p><p>Starting at $1799, the latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a top-tier device that comes with powerhouse hardware, AI-enhanced software, and a plethora of other goodies. That&apos;s all well and good, but just how big of an upgrade it is over the previous-gen Pixel Fold?</p><p>Let&apos;s take a comparative look at the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold and find out how these foldables stack up against each other.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-design-displays-and-build-quality-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Design, displays, and build quality</h2>
<p>Having a completely refreshed design, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks (and feels) entirely different from its predecessor. While the Pixel Fold has a curved and polished frame, the newest model features flat sides with a satin finish. Not just that, but the front and the back are now fully flat glass surfaces as well. The reworked hinge is a huge improvement over what you&apos;d find on the Pixel Fold, as it allows the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to lay fully flat when it&apos;s unfolded.</p><p>The matte-finished back panel of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a welcome change over the glossy rear of the last-gen model. It&apos;s home to the foldable&apos;s triple-lens primary camera system, housed in a rectangular module — complete with rounded corners — placed on the top left corner. The lenses themselves sit in two pill-shaped cutouts that are stacked horizontally, with the LED flash and a microphone situated on their right. This design change helps give the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a unique visual identity, although there&apos;s no denying that Google&apos;s signature &apos;camera bar&apos; design — found on the Pixel Fold — will always remain iconic.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold sports a 6.3-inch &apos;Actua&apos; display that&apos;s much bigger than the 5.8-inch display of the Pixel Fold. Although both are incredible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-your-phone-display-work" target="_blank">OLED</a> panels having all the usual characteristics (e.g., 120Hz variable refresh rate, HDR support), what&apos;s interesting is the aspect ratio. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes with a 20:9 screen, which is a bit taller than the 17.4:9 screen of the Pixel Fold. And of course, it&apos;s not change for change&apos;s sake. The taller display — which is exactly the same as the one you&apos;d find on the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro — allows for an enhanced app experience.</p><p>Open up the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and you&apos;ll immediately notice that the inner screen has changed as well. The 8.0-inch &apos;Super Actua Flex&apos; display is a bit bigger than the 7.6-inch display of the Pixel Fold. Both are stunning folding OLED panels, but again, it&apos;s the aspect ratio that&apos;s particularly worth talking about. Compared to the 1.2:1 screen of the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a practically square 1.03:1 screen that should not only help minimize app compatibility issues, but also make multitasking a much better affair.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you get all the usual improvements (e.g., increased peak brightness, LTPO support for the inner screen) as well. Both smartphones are quite durable and come backed by an IPX8 rating. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 26g lighter than the Pixel Fold, despite having a larger physical footprint. It&apos;s also the thinnest foldable you can get in the United States, measuring just 5.1mm when unfolded.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hardware-and-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Hardware and cameras</h2>

<p>Google&apos;s latest foldable flagship brings quite a few upgrades when it comes to core hardware. Just like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">three slab-styled siblings</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is driven by the brand-new Tensor G4 SoC and comes with 16GB of RAM. In comparison, the Pixel Fold is powered by the now two-year old Tensor G2 chipset and comes with 12GB of RAM. Storage options remain unchanged, however, which means you have 256GB or 512GB to choose from.</p><p>Obviously, spec sheets aren&apos;t everything and we haven&apos;t had the chance to put the device through its paces yet. However, considering that Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found the Pixel Fold to be an admirable everyday performer in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, we&apos;re fairly certain the Pixel 9 Pro Fold won&apos;t disappoint us either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3V3p3G4grvbYfTxzeXAmgC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-porcelain-camera-module-close.jpg" alt="Close-up on Porcelain Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3V3p3G4grvbYfTxzeXAmgC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Primary Camera System - Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a triple-lens primary camera system that, at least on paper, looks almost identical to that on the Pixel Fold. The primary sensor is still a 48MP unit with a 1/2-inch sensor size, and it&apos;s complemented by a 10.5MP ultrawide module and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The ultrawide sensor has a slightly lower resolution this time around, but the telephoto unit is the same. Also, the field of view has increased for both.</p><p>You get two additional cameras as well — one on the outside and one on the inside — with both having slightly improved resolution and better field of view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EhVauEN7xPKnmgrgyKEMs5" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-back-folded-camera-bar-black-01.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel Fold closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhVauEN7xPKnmgrgyKEMs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Primary Camera System - Google Pixel Fold </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, we all know that when it comes to Pixels, it&apos;s Google&apos;s image processing that makes the real magic happen. As such, we&apos;re sure that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will end up among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> (regardless of the form factor) out there, just like the Pixel Fold.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-software-and-ai-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Software and AI</h2>
<p>A minimal yet feature-laden software experience has always been the hallmark of Pixel smartphones, even more so when we&apos;re talking about a foldable. For its newest folding flagship, it seems Google has taken the already fantastic software of the previous-gen model and supercharged it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking-angled.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold - Split-Screen Multitasking </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on" target="_blank">hands-on</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a delight when it comes to multitasking. The reworked aspect ratio of the inner display allows two &apos;regular-sized&apos; apps to run in split-screen mode. You can pin the taskbar at the bottom, quickly launch multiple pairs of your frequently used apps side-by-side, and even have a third app running in a floating window.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-new-google-ai-features-claims" target="_blank">Google AI</a> is now a much more integral part of the device&apos;s overall user experience than it has ever been. You get a bunch of new apps (e.g., Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Studio) that leverage AI to enhance your workflow. Then there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, Google&apos;s built-in AI chatbot and Large Language Model (LLM) that can help you write stories from prompts, provide contextual information based on what&apos;s on your device&apos;s screen, and more.</p>

<p>Running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review" target="_blank">Android 14</a> out of the box, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is eligible for seven years of OS and security updates. Conversely, the Pixel Fold launched with Android 13 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-os-updates-will-the-pixel-fold-receive" target="_blank">is eligible</a> for five years of updates.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-should-you-upgrade-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>The latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers just about everything one could possibly want from a modern foldable. You get a truckload of AI-powered software features, fantastic cameras, and two gorgeous displays that work equally well for multitasking and multimedia, all in a redesigned chassis that looks and feels every bit as premium as its price suggests.</p><p>On the other hand, the last-gen Pixel Fold still remains an extremely well-rounded foldable. It has a unique form factor, top-of-the-line cameras, and software features that continue to be unmatched. Moreover, since it&apos;s no longer the newest thing in town, buying one at a lower price shouldn&apos;t be that hard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2A8sbvw4AtGhGSQqxumdZW" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-stacked-angle-inner-screen-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold stacked showing inner home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2A8sbvw4AtGhGSQqxumdZW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Undoubtedly, these are two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best foldable phones</a> (at least in the high-end segment) you can get in the market right now. If you&apos;re planning to buy your first folding flagship, you should simply pick the one that better fits your budget.</p><p>However, if you already have the Pixel Fold, we recommend upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold only if you can get a great trade-in discount. Sure, the newer displays and fancy AI features are great, but they don&apos;t really seem worth shelling out $1,799 for, especially when you can save $400 get the awesome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Open</a> instead!</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive offers an early glimpse into Google's plans to integrate Pixel Screenshots in Circle to Search.</li><li>After highlighting an area, users can "save" a photo to Pixel Screenshots to return later and leverage Gemini's capabilities for rediscovery.</li><li>The Pixel Screenshots app debuted alongside several more Pixel 9 AI features like "Call Notes" and Gemini Live.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google may continue iterating on Circle to Search by implementing a recently debuted AI-based feature.</p><p>An APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-pixel-screenshots-integration-3472694/">Android Authority</a> shows that Google is reportedly working on integrating Pixel Screenshots into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. As shown in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/caqtKdNJlxU">the demo</a>, when highlighting a portion of your screen, users will find a new "Save" button in the options row above the selected area.</p><p>It seems Google will produce a splash screen when users tap that button for the first time. The company states that saving what&apos;s been circled will help you "remember what you find." It adds, "the highlighted section of your screen will be saved to screenshots." This is about Pixel Screenshots as attempting to view the photo throws you into the app — and the image in question.</p><p>Users can add a note about the screenshot or share it alongside information about when it was taken.</p><p>The integration was spotted in the Google app&apos;s latest beta version (15.32.37.29.arm64). There&apos;s no telling when this will roll out, despite how far along the development appears.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:227.27%;"><img id="bpWYVQxqkQALgiDVQUohGb" name="pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-integration-spotted.jpg" alt="An APK dive shows that Google plans to integrate Pixel Screenshots into Circle to Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bpWYVQxqkQALgiDVQUohGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="264" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another aspect of this integration is the text box beneath a saved screenshot from Circle to Search that states "Processing Paused." It explains that the screenshot taken is not "AI enabled" and informs the user that they must do so in their settings to leverage Gemini&apos;s intelligence.</p><p>This is where the rediscovery side of Pixel Screenshot&apos;s implementation into Circle to Search comes into play.</p><p>Following the Pixel 9, one exciting feature was Pixel Screenshots and how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on#:~:text=Google%20is%20overhauling%20how%20screenshots%20work%20on%20the%20Pixel%209">Google is increasing the usefulness</a> of such pictures. Aside from automatic organization, the feature leverages Gemini&apos;s AI to process and understand the available information in a photo. Additionally, users can inquire about something specific to Gemini in the screenshot to help.</p><p>In other cases, the app will recognize where a screenshot was snapped (like Google Maps) and ask the user if they&apos;d like to research it.</p><p>This was one of a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Pixel 9 exclusive Gemini features</a> that Google detailed during its event last week. Gemini Live was the other side of things; a conversational variant of the model that helps users understand a host of topics. Gemini&apos;s new overlay brings text-to-image generation to more places like Messages and Gmail.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next-generation of Galaxy tablets are on the way and it seems they&apos;ve made the usual certification appearance.</p><p>We&apos;re missing the Galaxy Tab S10 series, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/tablets/tablets-news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-tab-s10-ultra-3c/">MySmartPrice</a> states the devices have now appeared in China&apos;s 3C Certification database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-tab-s10-fast-charging-speed-leak/">SamMobile</a>). Only two devices were seen listed: the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (SM-X820) and the Tab S10 Ultra (SM-X926C). According to the database, Samsung will debut the devices with 45W (wired) fast charging.</p><p>Unfortunately, the database doesn&apos;t offer any insight into the potential battery capacities of the devices in question.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/tablets/tablets-news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-bis-certification/">reiterated a previous rumor</a>, which stated the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus may arrive with cellular and Wi-Fi connection. If true, it wouldn&apos;t be anything new. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus</a> also featured 5G connection capabilities alongside the expected Wi-Fi connection in 2023.</p><p>However, that BIS certification appearance said nothing about the Ultra model — similar to last year when the Plus model was solo with 5G.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MecTZdNduJtgy5X9p8xeHh" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-on-stand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MecTZdNduJtgy5X9p8xeHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8064" height="4536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>With the Galaxy Tab S10 series appearing for certification, it seems consumers are in for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">more of the same</a>. The Tab S9 Plus and Tab S9 Ultra launched with the same 45W wired charging speeds. This has been a common trend for Samsung as even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-vs-tab-s7-plus">the Tab S7 Plus</a> offered it. Even the battery capacity of the Plus has remained consistent at 10,090mAh.</p><p>The Tab S9 Ultra features an 11,200mAh battery. It remains to be seen if Samsung offers any upgrades in that department.</p><p>In other news, rumors state Samsung is ditching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">smaller base Tab model</a> in favor of its two larger editions. Sources claimed in July that the company is more interested in offering tablets of a larger display size.</p><p>Supposedly, Samsung is eyeing a starting AMOLED panel size of 12 inches, with the potential to go higher. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">Renders of the Ultra model</a> were spotted with a design similar to the Tab S9 version with a 14.6-inch display.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-mediatek-featured-globally">is also rumored</a> to side with MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC instead of Qualcomm this year. Additionally, with the tablets missing from Unpacked in July, speculation states Samsung might launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">them in October</a>. That launch could feature the supposed Tab S10 duo <em>and </em>the Galaxy S24 FE.</p>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> assistant is getting a sleek new look on Android, featuring a floating panel with a glowing animation.</p><p>The new interface on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is rolling out now, featuring a glowing animation that lights up around the panel when Gemini is summoned, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/17/gemini-glow-floating-overlay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The animation looks fantastic and doesn’t crowd your screen. It offers a smart overlay that knows what you’re doing in the background, letting Gemini work seamlessly with your current app instead of taking over your entire screen.</p><p>First shown at Google’s developer conference in May, this panel is designed to help you keep working smoothly while giving you useful information from the AI assistant.</p><p>If you want a more immersive experience, just tap the upper-right corner of the overlay to expand it to full screen. Plus, the panel works smoothly with Gemini’s image generation features, letting you drag and drop images right into Gmail or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>.</p>

<p>The update also brings a new "Ask about this video" chip for YouTube videos, replacing the old "Ask about this screen" prompt. This upgrade lets users easily get summaries or ask questions about video content, making it super handy for educational videos and cutting down on note-taking and comprehension work.</p><p>In summary, the new Gemini features for Android are a big upgrade. The floating panel, in particular, is a smart addition that enhances the user experience, making it easy to use Gemini while on the go.</p><p>This update comes right after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">launch of Google’s Gemini Live</a>, which rolled out a more natural, chat-like interface for talking to the chatbot.</p><p>While the new Gemini overlay offers a smoother user experience, it doesn’t match the advanced conversational features of Gemini Live. The good news is, unlike Gemini Live—which needs a Gemini Advanced subscription—the overlay is available to all Gemini users.</p><p>Right now, these new features are available to just a few users. But Google plans to roll them out to a wider audience in the coming weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out Pixel Camera version 9.5.118, which brings manual Astrophotography activation to users.</li><li>After updating, users can find the mode in Night Sight's duration slider without waiting for their device to produce it automatically.</li><li>The company also started rolling out "Zoom Enhance" to the Pixel 8 Pro last week alongside details of its availability on the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out a Pixel Camera update that gives users reliable control over a unique nighttime setting.</p><p>As Google News (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4208">Telegram</a>) spotted, the company is pushing a Pixel Camera update marked as version 9.5.118 for manual Astrophotography (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/enable-astrophotography-mode-manually-pixel-phone/">Android Police</a>). The feature has previously played off the Pixel&apos;s "Night Sight" camera mode, which is where Google has placed its manual control.</p><p>The post suggests that users should notice a pop-up in the Pixel Camera app when switching to Night Sight <em>after </em>updating. The company has included a new crescent moon icon to represent Astrophotography within Night Sight&apos;s duration slider. </p><p>Tapping the shutter button will produce a five-second timer and it&apos;s encouraged that users remain still to capture the best quality photo. However, the post adds that users can turn this timer off if they&apos;re already stable and want to take pictures without delay.</p><p>The publication states that capturing and processing Astrophotography mode content may take longer "depending on your Pixel&apos;s age." So, it&apos;s likely that the newly announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has the quickest draw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.30%;"><img id="han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn" name="pixel-camera-manual-astrophotography-update.jpg" alt="Google is pushing an update for the Pixel Camera that brings manual Astrophotography control." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google News / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has started rolling this update out to Pixel devices, but it doesn&apos;t seem widespread yet. More devices should see it as the week progresses. For the daring, the publication states you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-release/pixel-camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-android-apk-download/">manually sideload the update</a> through APKMirror.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> has been a good way for interested parties to capture low-light or night shots, though its preference for the "perfect scenario" could hitch you up. It&apos;s always been activated through Night Sight; however, users were previously required to keep their devices still. The mode was automatic, meaning users (ideally) needed a tripod to meet the feature&apos;s demands and let it activate.</p><p>Moreover, users can hop into the <strong>camera app > Go to Night Sight > Settings </strong>to tinker with those shutter timer settings. Google&apos;s advanced settings for the mode include resolution sizes, a time-lapse option, and if you&apos;d like to shoot in JPEG or RAW.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google started rolling out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-rollout">Zoom Enhance</a>" for the Pixel 8 Pro with details about the feature&apos;s release on the Pixel 9. The feature leverages its AI software to "intelligently" fill in those gaps and faults when zooming into a photo to keep its high quality. This was a feature Google teased in 2023 and it seems its longer-than-expected development holds a slight drawback.</p>
