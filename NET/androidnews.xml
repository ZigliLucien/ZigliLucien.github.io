<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta on Android brings in a handy new voice note transcribe feature.</li><li>The update will likely roll out soon for Android, as it is already available for iOS.</li><li>Users who'd like to use the feature would have to install an additional 150MB of app data to enable the feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is working on yet another nifty feature for Android devices, which will finally bring the ability to transcribe voice messages. The feature was introduced earlier for WhatsApp on iOS and might soon be included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones.</a></p><p>Tipster AssembleDebug has spotted the feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Whatsapp-Voice-Message-Transcription-Android.html?m=1">TheSpAndroid</a>) in the Meta-owned messaging platform&apos;s latest beta (WhatsApp version <strong>2.24.7.7</strong>). The APK teardown has revealed some strings regarding the feature, indicating the Android device&apos;s requirements to enable transcripts on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Per the strings, enabling transcripts should become accessible. However, users who want to test the new feature must download 150MB of new app data. After allowing, users will then get to read the transcripts before they listen to the voice messages they receive.</p><p>"WhatsApp uses your device&apos;s speech recognition to provide end-to-end encrypted transcripts. Learn more," the string further explains.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-7-8-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> further shares some insights about the new feature alongside the screenshot of the feature in the works through the WhatsApp beta <strong>2.24.7.8</strong> version, available through the Google Play Beta program. The feature is believed to be "designed to enhance accessibility and convenience for users who prefer reading text over listening to voice notes," notes WBI. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="BhXLYMZyA3ruqFQEHJR8Po" name="whatsapp-android-voice-note-transcribe.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Voice Note Transcribe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BhXLYMZyA3ruqFQEHJR8Po.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The strings from the aforementioned APK teardown can clearly be seen in the screenshot shared by WBI. It is presumably the end user interface that WhatsApp users can expect before enabling the feature when the update rolls out officially soon. </p><p>The upcoming feature utilizing on-device speech recognition and not just relying solely on the voice note audio is a win-win, as the transcription doesn&apos;t leave the device and is simultaneously end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>As the feature is expected to roll out soon, users will be able to see the voice transcriptions right under the voice note bubble in the conversation pane of any individual chat or group. As of now, the feature is currently in development and still in beta and is expected to come in an official rollout soon.</p>

<ul><li>Google has been making small tweaks to many of its first-party apps, and Google Contacts is the latest one to get a slight redesign.</li><li>Google Contacts no longer features a navigation drawer, and it is now replaced with a singular dropdown menu, a label picker, and a filtering button. </li><li>Separately, there's a new page for creating and managing custom ringtones under the "Fix & manage" tab. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making visual user-interface changes to the Google Contacts app on Android, removing the navigation drawer and adding a new page for custom ringtones. The minor redesign makes it easier to sort, label, and filter contacts in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-google-contacts-tips-tricks">Google Contacts app</a>. It&apos;s available now with <strong>version 4.27.26</strong> of the app, but you may need to restart the app in order for the redesign to take effect. </p><p>Navigation drawers are on the way out across many of Google&apos;s first-party apps, and now that includes Google Contacts. Instead of the drawer, there are three main toggles available. There&apos;s a dropdown menu under the search bar that lets you change views. You can see all your contacts at once, view contacts tied to a specific Google account, or create custom views. </p><p>To the left of the new dropdown menu are two toggles. There&apos;s a label picker that lets you create new labels or select existing ones, and a filtering button that makes it possible to separate phone contacts, email contacts, and companies. Generally, the functionality here isn&apos;t new, it&apos;s just in a different place. Instead of the hamburger menu icon, there&apos;s a search icon at the top of Google Contacts&apos; main tab. </p>

<p>Separately, Google is introducing a new page for creating and managing custom ringtones in the Google Contacts app. It&apos;s found in the <strong>Fix and manage</strong> tab, under the <strong>Other tools</strong> section. After tapping the <strong>Contact ringtones</strong> option in the list, you&apos;ll be greeted with the new page. You can use this tool to give each contact in the Google Contacts app its own unique ringtone. </p><p>"Add a custom ringtone to individual contacts to help you recognize who&apos;s calling," the page explains. "To manage the default ringtone for this device, visit Settings."</p>

<p>Both changes are rolling out now in the Google Contacts app following a server-side update. Make sure your Google Contacts app is <strong>version 4.27</strong> or higher for good measure, and then restart it to see the new changes. The redesign joins other recent updates to Google Contacts, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-app-live-location-sharing">live location for contacts</a>.</p>

Glancing at my neighbors&apos; nametags, I saw engineers from Tencent, Epic Games, and other notable devs and publishers, all crammed into uncomfortable chairs to see Google&apos;s AI-tinted vision of how Android games can get better.</p><p>I&apos;m used to people evangelizing doomed or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/concept-devices-are-going-too-far">premature concepts</a> at industry events like GDC. However, this hour-long talk, given by a carousel of Google engineers and execs, sounded more like a helpful warning to the industry that AI-backed games are <em>already</em> happening and that they&apos;d better get on board if they want to keep up. </p><p>Simon Tokumine, director of product management for Google AI, explained how game devs are using generative AIs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> today for "ideation" when creating concept art, dialogue, and even early soundtrack treatments. </p><p>The next step, which Google thinks will arrive in the "next few years," is an influx of "living games." These games will have a similar model to live service games like Fortnite and Destiny 2, except that the updates will be "underpinned by generative AI," says Jack Buser, the director of games for Google Cloud.</p><p>What does this mean for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">Android games</a>? Can GenAI really usher in a new era of gaming on par with "CD-ROMs and 3D graphics," as Buser promises? I&apos;ll run through the highlights of Google&apos;s vision of the future. </p>

<p>Every game developer is looking for its next cash cow. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20240202198419/griffin-gaming-partners-and-rendered-vc-release-the-2023-game-development-report" target="_blank">2023 Game Development Report</a> shows that 65% of surveyed development studios make live service games, and 30% plan to jump on the bandwagon. However, that same survey suggests that most developers don&apos;t have the resources to <em>pull off</em> the live service games that shareholders want. </p><p>Google&apos;s solution is to shift focus to living games that constantly update and create new content self-sufficiently, without the same labor demands. </p><p>Buser described how living games would respond to players&apos; "implicit or explicit desires," adapting gameplay to address complaints or to emphasize popular features. He hinted that Google has "something coming very soon on that," possibly a new Gemini feature.</p><p>The panel also keyed in on GenAI-based non-playable characters (NPCs), something that other major tech companies like NVIDIA have focused on this week.</p>

<p>These tech companies, eager for a world where no one has to pay creatives like voice actors ever again, have begun showing off these futuristic tech demos that lip-sync to dialogue generated by large language models. </p><p>Buser says these "fully organic" NPCs, in the context of an MMO, will remember what past players asked and adjust their dialogue accordingly. They&apos;ll also be able to create LLM "chains" where an NPC can pull from other chatbots for information the player needs but doesn&apos;t have. </p><p>Dan Zaratsian, a Google AI/ML solutions architect, later described a vision of hundreds of thousands of GenAI-powered NPCs in a single world with individual character profiles, remembered player interactions, and dialogue with specific rulesets like the game&apos;s lore and history.</p><p>Without a trace of irony, Tokumine described how these computer-backed NPCs would make video game worlds "much more human, much more alive, and much more complete" than ever — despite the lack of actual people involved in making them.</p><p>Humans would need to be involved to ensure that the LLMs don&apos;t generate inappropriate or incoherent content, Google assured. But at the automated scale this LLM system describes, it&apos;s not entirely clear how any game could have enough editors to avoid any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-gemini-ai-image-generation-faults">GenAI controversies</a> or "financial issues."</p>

<p>Right now, Google uses its AI to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-using-ai-to-show-app-highlights-in-play-store-listings">auto-generate Play Store descriptions</a> and improve its game marketing to players. And with the recent launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">Gemini 1.5</a>, the generative AI can now handle up to one million tokens.</p><p>The Google team on stage described what this means for developers: You can now upload half an hour of video or three hours of audio to Gemini and "ask it what comes next." You can also upload 10,000 lines of raw code, plus a video of your engineers fixing errors, and have Gemini use that template to catch and fix other errors for you. </p><p>Lei Zhang, Google&apos;s director for Play Partnerships and Global GenAI, described how he uploaded "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" to Gemini 1.5 to create a Sherlock Holmes RPG with a story based on the detective&apos;s past adventures — something Zhang says the original Gemini 1.0 couldn&apos;t handle. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ysJQwTap6BN2hmBTieGpLE" name="Google-AI-Gemma.png" alt="Gemma launch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ysJQwTap6BN2hmBTieGpLE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond Gemini, the panel brought up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Google Gemma</a>, the new open-source AI that developers can license commercially. Google wants smaller developers to use Gemma for "rapid prototyping," world-building, dialogue, and other applications that would normally require more resources to implement on a large scale. </p><p>Larger developers are already using Google&apos;s Vertex AI, which Buser says can be "tuned" so that its algorithm focuses on the devs&apos; own rules and data, with greater privacy and more powerful applications. </p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-google-apos-s-genai-vision-2">The problems with Google&apos;s GenAI vision</h2>
<p>Right now, your favorite roguelikes use procedural generation to create randomized challenges and layouts from human-made templates. And, of course, games like No Man&apos;s Sky create vast galaxies of generated planets at a scale humans couldn&apos;t achieve by themselves.</p><p>If procedural generation expanded to include AI-based NPCs, that could make worlds feel more lived in than ever... but only if the LLMs backing them can become intelligent enough to work unsupervised and avoid hallucinations. </p><p>That also applies to "living games" that will change based on user feedback. Can future versions of Gemini actually be trusted to come up with updates that&apos;ll keep users engaged and on par with the customized, carefully conceived seasons and expansions that gamers have grown used to? Or is Google just taking creativity for granted as something their algorithm can eventually copy?</p><p>Google has hired musicians, artists, and lyricists to train its AI to spew out better results, but its AI almost certainly is trained off of unpaid artists&apos; and writers&apos; work found via Google Search. A public-domain Sherlock Holmes RPG is fine, but Google can&apos;t monitor if companies start feeding Gemini copyrighted material for "inspiration" that blurs the line with theft.</p>

<p>I couldn&apos;t say if the GDC 2024 attendees agreed with Google&apos;s vision or not. But like so many other gaming trends—like live service games—it seems like the kind of thing that executives will latch onto regardless of the problems due to the potential for profitable games without having to pay as much for labor.</p><p>Other major tech brands like Xbox and NVIDIA have their own AI panels coming up this week at GDC, so don&apos;t be surprised if AI becomes a regular fixture of gaming whether or not you want it. </p><p>With Google&apos;s partners specifically, don&apos;t be surprised if more and more Android games start using GenAI and LLMs to make randomized puzzles or new narrative NPCs at a regular cadence. This will give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> more games to play, but the level of quality and originality will be another question entirely.</p>

<ul><li>Folding phones, due to their extra moving parts, sometimes suffer from issues that traditional smartphones are immune from. </li><li>Specifically, some Samsung Galaxy Z Fold users have reported their smartphones being unable to unfold completely flat.</li><li>One Reddit user managed to solve the problem by dismantling his Galaxy Z Fold 4 and removing debris from the hinge by hand.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against/" target="_blank">One Reddit user</a> thinks they&apos;ve proven why their foldable phone won&apos;t open fully flat, and it appears to have something to do with debris finding its way into the moving part of the hinge. (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/samsung-foldable-hinge-open-flat/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>In the post, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 user described having an increasingly difficult time opening their smartphone completely flat. After failed attempts to get Samsung to repair or replace the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, the user decided to take matters into their own hands. Taking apart the device revealed a collection of lint, thread, and other debris were trapped inside the hinge — preventing it from opening. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1bfrnpi/managed_to_open_fold_4_flat_evidence_against">Managed to Open Fold 4 Flat - Evidence Against Samsung's Warranty Denial</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold">r/GalaxyFold</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>After putting the device back together, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 unit in question was able to open completely flat again. While this is just one unit, it does seem to confirm something that was already suspected — dust and debris are enemies to folding phones and can cause issues later on. </p><p>Notably, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> are rated as IPX8 certified, which means they are water — but <strong>not</strong> dust — resistant. This means that it&apos;s certainly possible, maybe even plausible, that dust and debris could end up in the foldables over time. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> have plenty of appeal, whether they offer a bigger screen or a smaller form factor than a traditional smartphone. However, they also come with their own set of compromises, which are highlighted by a high cost of entry and durability concerns. While Samsung was the first company to truly bring foldables mainstream, it too has experienced durability issues with the Galaxy Z Fold lineup. Early versions suffered from display problems, and later ones have struggled to open completely flat after months or years of use.</p><p>The issue of folding phones not opening flat became an important topic around the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, which some claim is not able to unfold flat. One of our units at Android Central indeed seems to be limited to 178-179 degrees rather than the full 180 degrees.</p><p>Luckily, Samsung and other OEMs appear to be making solid progress on their foldable hardware. Samsung, for example, debuted a new hinge mechanism on the Galaxy Z Fold 5, although it remains to be seen whether that device succumbs to some of the same issues as its predecessors. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> has both water and dust resistance.</p>

<ul><li>Epic announced that the Epic Games Store will be available on Android later this year.</li><li>Epic says it will bring the same revenue split offered on PC to Android and iOS, where developers keep 88% of revenue, and Epic takes 12% of revenue. </li><li>This significantly undercuts the revenue split offered on the Google Play Store, where some developers only have to pay Google a 15% fee, but high earners could give up as much as 30%. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic is bringing the Epic Games Store to Android later this year, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/all-the-big-news-from-the-state-of-unreal-at-gdc-24" target="_blank">announced</a> during the State of Unreal event at GDC ’24. The move comes after Epic said it would launch an alternative app marketplace on iOS in the European Union. Now, it&apos;s confirmed that Android will also be getting the Epic Games Store, though not many details have been finalized yet. </p><p>The company is touting the upcoming Epic Games Store for Android as having the "same fair terms" as its desktop game marketplace. Essentially, this claim is based on the revenue split that Epic will offer to developers. The company will take 12% of the revenue from purchases, while developers get to retain 88% of that revenue. Additionally, Epic will allow apps and games to sell in-app purchases via independent methods, where they can keep 100% of earned revenue. </p><p>It&apos;s important to remember that the Epic Games Store coming to Android is different than the Epic Games Launcher. The latter has been available on Android since 2019, and it allows users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-epic-147-million-deal-antitrust-case">download and update games from Epic</a>, such as Fortnite. However, it will have taken five years for the Epic Games Launcher to be joined by a mobile Epic Games Store.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re coming to iOS and Android!Same fair terms, available to all developers, on a true multi-platform store – with amazing games for everyone. pic.twitter.com/TUKlF8PI8A<a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1770500825166545305">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It&apos;s not a secret that Epic plans to use the Epic Games Store to compete with the Google Play Store on Android. Google takes a cut of between 15% and 30% of revenue earned on the Play Store, with the highest-grossing developers paying more. Epic will aim to disrupt this arrangement by giving the same 88/12 split to developers of all sizes. At the same time, this split would undercut the Google Play Store&apos;s fees entirely. </p><p>Epic also says the Epic Games Store "will become the first ever game-focused, multi-platform store, and will work across Android, iOS, PC, and macOS."</p><p>Still, we&apos;ll need to wait for more information about the store&apos;s features and availability. Though the company included some mockups of what the Epic Games Store might look like on mobile, they are "concepts only."</p>

<p>YouTube TV&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-build-a-multiview-spotted">build a multiview</a>" was first spotted in a limited fashion at the end of January for smart TVs. The feature has since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/custom-multiviews-in-youtube-tv-let-you-pick-four-basketball-games-to-watch-at-once">officially rolled out</a>, just in time for March Madness. Users will find initial support for the NBA League Pass and NCAA basketball games. However, the feature is still quite limited, as users can only choose games belonging to a singular genre.</p><p>If you&apos;re watching the NBA, you&apos;ll only find NBA games to customize your multiview. It&apos;s disappointing that multiview&apos;s arrival on mobile lacks this customization, but there&apos;s always a chance it will arrive in the future.</p><p>Other YouTube TV news involves the app picking up a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-gets-new-last-channel-shortcut"> "last channel" </a>shortcut for easier channel switching. To utilize the new switcher, users will need to long-press the "select" or "OK" buttons on their remote. The app&apos;s shortcut is said to work with Live TV, videos on demand, and DVR content.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's mobile chief, TM Roh, discussed the company's review of whether or not it could bring full Galaxy AI support to the S22 series.</li><li>Roh stated there is little difference between the S22 and the S23 FE, which is eligible for Galaxy AI, so the company is preparing to investigate further.</li><li>Roh also mentioned the company's interest in a rollable Android phone, stating the company is looking into how consumers could use it and its place on the market.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new development from Samsung&apos;s mobile division chief could signal a change in its Galaxy AI approach for a past-gen series.</p><p>According to a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/003/0012438768?sid=105">Naver</a>, Samsung&apos;s mobile division chief TM Roh spoke about potentially bringing Galaxy AI support to the Galaxy S22 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ai-galaxy-s22-series-3427208/">Android Authority</a>). Roh added, during the company&apos;s 55th annual general shareholders meeting, that it is "reviewing" whether or not such AI features could be applied to the two-year-old series.</p><p>Galaxy AI relies heavily on a device&apos;s hardware capabilities as Samsung reportedly aims for "hybrid AI" that blends on-device and cloud-based features. However, Roh stated that the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> aren&apos;t vastly different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, which is eligible for the AI update.</p><p>Roh mentioned that Samsung is "gradually preparing" plans to bring full Galaxy AI support to the S22 series. Despite that, there are other "limitations" to take into account before proceeding. So, there&apos;s a chance that the makeup of the S22 series proves too difficult.</p><p>During the meeting, Roh discussed the company&apos;s apparent interest in a rollable Android phone. He stated, "we are currently steadily pursuing these procedures." Consumers and a rollable phone&apos;s place on the market is another object of discussion Samsung is currently reviewing internally.</p><p>Regarding the S22, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-not-getting-galaxy-ai">reported in January</a> that Samsung would skip the past-gen series. It was a curious decision, considering the S22 and the S23 FE utilize the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, meaning there was likely another aspect of the former that swayed Samsung&apos;s decision.</p><p>For now, owners of a Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, or S22 Ultra can expect the upcoming One UI 6.1 update.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung&apos;s interest in a rollable phone has been floating about for a while as the company showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">more concepts</a> during CES 2024. During the conference, folks were treated to a look at the Korean OEM&apos;s "In&Out Flip." The device could fold its display 360 degrees, meaning users could still utilize its main display even while "closed."</p><p>Another device, the Rollable Flex, was presented as a device that could unroll and become five times larger than its original form.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Wallet has been receiving new updates lately, and another one has been added to the mix: the ability to add the "pkpss" file format, which is the one that Apple Wallet uses.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> features the ability to import digital passes from the "pkpss" format. Rahman notes that he received a tip from a Telegram user (Cob) showcasing the addition of the downloaded "pkpss" file format on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Wallet may soon be able to import digital passes saved in Apple's .pkpass format!One user on Telegram tells me that Google Wallet is now able to import .pkpass files. This doesn't work for me yet, though. Let me know if this works for you!(Thanks to Cob on Telegram for… https://t.co/jjAL3o2mbA pic.twitter.com/O69NHNRs6L<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1768745883305173312">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As mentioned, the pkpss file format is usually seen in Apple Wallet; however, a pkpss format download can be added to Google Wallet through a few simple steps, per the video shared by Rahman on X. Accessing the file from the system and later agreeing to some terms and conditions, the user could easily add it to the Google Wallet app as a digital pass.</p><p>The support for this feature has been long overdue, as Google said it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1719411253171396859">incorporating this feature</a> back in 2022. However, Rahman spotted evidence of it being in the works last year. Regardless, the tip shared by Rahman on X indicates the feature is being rolled out to a few people. Some users who responded to Rahman&apos;s post have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1768749926761017384">acknowledged</a> the feature&apos;s availability on their devices in certain regions.</p>
<p>The criteria for the rollout to Android devices still need to be determined. Nonetheless, we expect it to roll out soon officially through an update to the Google Wallet app. With the soon-to-be-expected rollout, users can easily store tickets and digital IDs as well as import them even in the "pkpss" file format on their Google Wallet app. The new ability eliminates relying on third-party services to import the said file format.</p><p>The new feature comes after Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">recently gained</a> the ability to save movie tickets and boarding passes directly from Gmail. Users getting ticket confirmations from Gmail could see their tickets being added directly to the Google Wallet app. The same update has also included the ability to archive older passes.</p>

<p>Rumors swirl regarding Sony&apos;s upcoming Xperia 1 VI flagship device and a potential dip in quality.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1748136774/O57Zo0j9V">zackbuks</a> on Weibo, Sony may drop its 4K resolution display panel on the upcoming Xperia 1 VI (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/419426/sony-xperia-1-vi-display-specs-leak.html">fonearena</a>). Rumors suggest the device could drop down to the "2K Plus" resolution panel that the Xperia 5 series notably sported. The publication mentions another rumor, which states the device could receive a "Quad HD Plus" display instead.</p><p>The post speculates Sony may opt to make the upcoming Android phone a little wider in 2024 instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">last year&apos;s</a> taller form factor.</p><p>The Weibo leaker states that this could be due to a change in aspect ratio. They purport that once it launches, the device may change from a 21:9 to a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Design-wise, the Xperia 1 VI isn&apos;t expected to change. The post claims Sony will look to keep the next-gen phone "similar" to its 2023 release. Its triple camera array is expected to remain, with other rumors stating it could contain three 48MP lenses.</p><p>Additional details about the device are unknown, however, there&apos;s speculation that it could launch in May.</p>

<p>The rumors end with speculation that Sony could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1748136774/O5kD2i5St">move away</a> from its Xperia 5 series altogether this year. The company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-5-v-launch">Xperia 5 V</a> in September 2023, featuring its own downgrade through a dual-camera array. Despite the alteration, the device still packed the same camera sensor as its more expensive Xperia 1 V counterpart.</p><p>The alleged launch month for the Xperia 1 VI coincides with Sony&apos;s previous launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a>. The device debuted with a strong focus on its camera sensors for creators. The device&apos;s 4K display could reach a maximum 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the 1 V offered a 52MP-equivalent primary camera, a notable jump from the series&apos; old 12MP sensors.</p><p>Sony doesn&apos;t let users utilize the camera&apos;s entire strength, meaning they&apos;re only able to use 48MP of it. A 12MP ultrawide and a 12MP telephoto lens round out the array. More information about the upcoming Xperia 1 VI will likely surface as we move closer to its supposed launch.</p>
