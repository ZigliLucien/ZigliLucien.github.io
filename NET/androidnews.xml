<ul><li>An IDC analyst shared in a Bloomberg newsletter that sales for Sony's smartphone business dropped 40% last year.</li><li>The drops are expected to continue as Sony's Xperia brand struggles to compete with the likes of Apple and Google.</li><li>Sony is teasing the launch of a new Xperia phone during a May 15 announcement, and it is rumored to be targeting more of a mainstream audience. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony is just days away from launching a brand-new Xperia phone, and this reveal sounds like it will have a big impact on what mobile offerings from the company will look like moving forward. Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-marketing-images-leak">rumors and leaks</a>, the smartphone is expected to depart somewhat from Sony&apos;s typical strategy for handsets, which is to lean into the company&apos;s photography prowess and target the niche and premium markets. The strategy shift comes as Sony&apos;s mobile sales continue to take massive hits, according to data shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-10/biden-poised-to-impose-tariffs-on-china-evs-strategic-sectors" target="_blank">Bloomberg newsletter</a>.</p><p>Masafumi Inbe, an analyst for IDC, spoke to Bloomberg about Sony&apos;s struggles with Xperia, which have stretched even to its home market in Japan. Apple has a powerful user base in Japan and found success in bringing the iPhone to that market. Now, part of Google&apos;s plan for growing Pixel is to target markets like Japan, too. </p><p>Sony isn&apos;t a household name in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphones</a> anymore, and these developments further worsen its standing in the market. The company isn&apos;t one of the leaders in smartphone shipments, and it&apos;s going backward rather than forward. Part of the reason may be the direction of the Xperia brand, which is only appealing to a small number of people. </p><p>However, switching things up and making the next Xperia 1 VI more mainstream might not be the answer. If Sony can&apos;t compete with the major brands while offering a unique smartphone, why would it compete with a device that feels like a carbon copy of all the others?</p>
<h2 id="sony-apos-s-mobile-sales-are-falling-fast-2">Sony&apos;s mobile sales are falling, fast</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mT9Z3HmPu7MhipoR3E7BCT" name="sony-xperia-1-vi-marketing-images-leak-01.jpg" alt="Xperia 1 VI marketing images leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mT9Z3HmPu7MhipoR3E7BCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The global smartphone market has experienced frequent dips and peaks over the last few years, largely related to the fluctuating economy and world events. But Sony&apos;s mobile sales aren&apos;t just slightly down compared to past years; they&apos;re down significantly. According to Inbe, Sony&apos;s mobile sales dropped by 40% in 2023 compared to the previous year.</p><p>A similar cratering is expected this year, Inbe says, which doesn&apos;t bode well for the future of Sony&apos;s mobile offerings. If sales were to decline by a total of 80% over the course of two years, it would be disastrous. </p><p>Inbe cites Sony&apos;s poor performance in Japan as one of the bigger reasons to sound the alarm. Sony sells about 1 million phones each year in Japan, Inbe says, where a total of 30 million smartphones are sold annually. </p><p>Sony doesn&apos;t report smartphone sales figures individually in its financial reports, which makes it hard to get a complete picture of the business. However, it&apos;s clear that mobile devices aren&apos;t a core business for the company in 2024. Still, Sony hasn&apos;t shown any signs of backing out of the smartphone market.</p><p>"We recognize that our mobile communications business is not only a handset business, but also a business with important communication technology that contributes to the entire Sony Group," a Sony spokeswoman told Bloomberg.</p><p>"We believe that the communication technology we hone with smartphone technology is a necessary element to connect creators and customers and to provide entertainment regardless of time and place."</p><p>Something has to give, and if the leaks are correct, that something will be Xperia strategy. While it seems Xperia&apos;s current positioning toward the ultra-premium camera lover isn&apos;t working, it&apos;s unclear what <em>will</em> work this late in the smartphone race.</p>
<h2 id="the-sony-xperia-brand-targets-a-market-that-barely-exists-2">The Sony Xperia brand targets a market that barely exists</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2773px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dZqYB9Nha5q8RuWaPAzZGR" name="sony-xperia-1-v-smartphone.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia 1 V phone cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZqYB9Nha5q8RuWaPAzZGR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2773" height="1560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In theory, Sony&apos;s plan for the Xperia lineup sounds great. The company already makes industry-leading cameras, so why not bring that down to the smartphone? Although it&apos;s a solid idea, it isn&apos;t working. That&apos;s because the Sony Xperia brand only caters to people in the middle of two big markets. </p><p>People who don&apos;t care much about standalone cameras will just grab any flagship smartphone, as the camera in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> will get the job done in most situations. On the other hand, people that really care about cameras will get something like a DSLR or mirrorless camera on top of their smartphone. The number of people who need more than a smartphone but less than a dedicated shooter has proven to be small, if Xperia sales are any indication. </p><p>As an anecdotal example, I&apos;m the exact kind of buyer who <em>should </em>find the Sony Xperia line appealing. I have a mirrorless camera — from Sony, evidently — that I use for work and a bit of play. I&apos;m not a photography buff, so I use my Sony a6400 pretty much stuck on automatic modes. Even with all that said, I wouldn&apos;t replace my smartphone or my mirrorless camera with an Xperia. For my fairly basic needs, a Sony Xperia smartphone would be a worse smartphone and a worse camera than what I currently use. So, what&apos;s the point? </p>
<h2 id="the-zenfone-11-ultra-proves-making-xperia-mainstream-won-apos-t-solve-anything-2">The Zenfone 11 Ultra proves making Xperia mainstream won&apos;t solve anything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-26.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY6EqfMcMRRDGxEqr6Vv9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have a solution for Sony. It feels like, in 2024, there are only a handful of brands that can really compete for the mainstream market. Although it appears Sony will try to do just that with the next Xperia, that might not be the best option.</p><p>We just saw Asus make a similar pivot with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review" target="_blank">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, and the general consensus wasn&apos;t positive. Instead, it showed that Asus had given up a small but vibrant niche to become just like all the other flagship smartphones. And despite being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-asus-phones">best Asus phones</a> ever, the Zenfone 11 Ultra couldn&apos;t stand out.</p><p>If Xperia tries to compete on equal footing with Apple, Google, and others, it&apos;ll lose. The brand&apos;s only shot at this point is to stay the course and make niche, unique smartphones that actually cater to a tangible audience, and that&apos;s already turning into a losing battle.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Circle to Search is now available on the Pixel Tablet running Android 14, allowing users to circle items on their screens to search the web instantly.</li><li>Following its announcement in January alongside the Galaxy S24 series launch, Circle to Search has been progressively introduced to Pixel smartphones.</li><li>Currently, the feature does not work in split-screen mode, but support for this is expected in a future update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Circle to Search is now rolling out on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-eyntk">Pixel Tablet</a> with Android 14, meaning you can circle things on your screen to instantly search the web.</p><p>It was inevitable that Google would bring Circle to Search to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> after hints of its upcoming release. Back in January, when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series launched, Google announced plans to expand Circle to Search to its Pixel devices. Since then, it has gradually made its way to the Pixel smartphones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/10/pixel-tablet-circle-to-search/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports that all Pixel Tablet users now have access to the handy feature. Previously, it was only available to users in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta.</p><p>During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">Pixel Tablet&apos;s re-launch</a> a few days ago, Google confirmed that Circle to Search would be added in late May, so this latest update isn&apos;t too surprising.</p><p>Google has introduced many features over the years, but Circle to Search has really caught everyone&apos;s attention. It offers more control over on-screen information with unmatched ease. Just press and hold on the bottom navigation bar, circle what you&apos;re curious about, and instant web search results will instantly show up.</p><p>For now, the Circle to Search feature only works when you&apos;re not using split screen. However, support for split screen should be available in a future update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">as it has already been tested in beta</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Circle to Search isn&apos;t available for iPhone users. However, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-workaround-for-iphones">offering Apple fans a similar solution</a> that essentially replicates the function.</p><p>Users of the latest iPhone models can now set up a shortcut for the Action Button to take a screenshot of their current screen and open it in the Google Lens app for analysis. Although it&apos;s not the exact same process as Circle to Search, it effectively achieves the same result.</p><p>It&apos;s common to see something on our phone screens that piques our interest, and Google is always looking to streamline how we get information. That&apos;s where Circle to Search comes in, offering a new method to look up information on mobile devices.</p>

But who needs a new design when the latest leak points to some welcome internal upgrades?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealntech.com/motorola-razr-50-ultra-eu-pricing-ram-storage-colors-surface/">A publication obtained a screenshot</a> of some retail listings of the Razr 50 Ultra, which gives us a good look at the configuration and expected pricing (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/09/motorolas-next-razr-leaked/">9to5Google</a>). The next Razr will be offered with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB on the current model, and 512GB of storage, double that of the Razr 40 Ultra.</p><p>While the Razr 40 Ultra was largely available in the singular 8GB+256GB configuration in global markets, including the U.S., the phone was offered with a model featuring 12GB of RAM and 512GB in China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1374px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.85%;"><img id="y62EkvZLsZqkxSoditBpd9" name="Motorla-razr-50-ultra-leaked-price-dealntech.jpg" alt="Leaked retail listing of the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y62EkvZLsZqkxSoditBpd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1374" height="314" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Deal N Tech)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the improved specs, we might expect the phone to cost more than its predecessor, but that might not be the case if the leak is accurate. The retail listing shows the Razr 50 Ultra priced at €1200, which is around the same launch price as its predecessor. Naturally, one might expect the U.S. price to be directly converted, but if last year&apos;s pricing scheme is followed, then the Razr Plus 2024 may stick to the same $999 price tag.</p><p>Lastly, the listing reveals available color options, which include Blue, Green, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Puzz</a>.</p><p>The presence of a retail listing, along with other leaks we&apos;ve seen of the phone, all point to an imminent launch of Motorolas next foldable, although the company has yet to announce when that will happen.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a lot that can be taken from this leak, especially when you consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-aka-razr-plus-2024-live-image">previous leaks</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. We&apos;ve seen that the device may likely retain the same design as the current model, which suggests that Motorola may focus on refining the experience with internal upgrades rather than spending time and money to drastically alter its looks.</p><p>And honestly, I&apos;m perfectly okay with that.</p><p>I&apos;m a big fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>; in fact, I&apos;ve been using it as my main driver since it was launched. It has great performance despite the older chipset and "only" having 8GB of RAM, and the design really stands out among other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, particularly the more angular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. There&apos;s not much I would change about the design other than the fact that I wish it were wider and not as tall, but that&apos;s honestly a pretty minor gripe for me.</p><p>The biggest changes <em>need</em> to happen internally. We don&apos;t know what chipset will power the Razr Plus 2024, but Motorola shouldn&apos;t rely on last year&apos;s chip and the same configuration if it wants to stay truly competitive. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> will likely launch this year with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and all the generative AI goodies that Samsung and Google have been touting all year long. Motorola should take advantage of the AI capabilities of the latest chip and beat Samsung to the punch with a decked-out flip phone.</p><p>Plus, 12GB seems to be the sweet spot for on-device generative AI features on smartphones, which is why it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">taking so long to reach the Pixel 8</a>.</p><p>Not only would it potentially match or even exceed the Galaxy in terms of power, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">Motorola already has the upper hand</a> with a better cover screen experience. I have a feeling things may play out the same this time around, with Samsung inexplicably limiting the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="yes2Qj9WabbbF44ZBQgoyj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-moto-razr-plus-cover-screen-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 with the Motorola Razr Plus (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yes2Qj9WabbbF44ZBQgoyj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, there are other upgrades I would love to see, like a better camera and a larger battery, so hopefully, shifting the focus away from design will give Motorola ample opportunity to focus on the upgrades we really want.</p><p>This is a strategy that Samsung has been holding onto for years. Very little changed between the Z Flip 3 and Z Flip 4, and the only major change with the Z Flip 5 was the enlarged cover screen. Samsung took a winning formula and continued to iterate, refusing to rock the boat with any jarring changes and instead giving consumers features and upgrades they wanted each year, like water resistance, a larger cover screen, and bigger batteries.</p><p>Motorola struggled with early iterations of the Razr, but the company has found a winning formula with the Razr Plus 2023. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/samsung-led-q423-foldable-market-huawei-expected-to-lead-in-q124-for-the-first-time">Recent numbers</a> show that the company is gaining in the global foldable market as one of the biggest players, which says a lot for a company that only sells one type of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. Motorola needs to hold onto that momentum and prove that it can keep up with Samsung, even if that means using a similar playbook.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a simple, user-friendly smart speaker for your home; you&apos;re already a user of Amazon&apos;s Alexa voice assistant or smart home ecosystem; you&apos;re looking for a smart home device that includes a temperature sensor.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a smart speaker that includes a 3.5mm input; you&apos;re looking for a larger smart speaker with more volume.</p><p>The small Echo Dot is a great little smart speaker, offering the whole range of smart home functionality that Amazon&apos;s devices have become known for. The temperature sensor makes it compatible with Amazon&apos;s suite of smart home automation controls, and it can even be used to extend your Wi-Fi network further around your house.</p><p>The main downside to this Echo Dot generation is that Amazon got rid of the 3.5mm input, so if that&apos;s a priority for you, it might be worth considering the 4th Gen instead.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps has started rolling out a new "charging station" filter that users can produce after selecting their vehicle type in settings.</li><li>Tapping the filter will highlight charging stations in a user's area alongside information like addresses and charging speeds.</li><li>Google plans to roll out more EV-related features "in the coming" months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is pushing a new update for Maps that helps smoothen the edges surrounding its EV experience for drivers.</p><p>German publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartdroid.de/google-maps-auf-android-endlich-mit-ladestationen-schnellzugriff-fuer-elektroautos/">Smartdroid</a> spotted a new filter for Google Maps that lets users search for "Charging Stations" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/10/google-maps-ev-charging-station-shortcut/">9to5Google</a>). To see this, EV owners must hop into the Maps app settings and navigate to "Your Vehicle." Selecting "electric" under "Engine type" will force this new charging station filter to appear.</p><p>Additionally, after selecting your vehicle, the new filter replaces the typical "Gas" filter in Maps.</p><p>The charging station filter quickly throws users into a search within Maps and begins marking the various spots in their area. More importantly, a list will appear, allowing users to scroll through the charging stations. The list looks at the spot&apos;s address and the number of chargers available.</p><p>EV drivers are also given information about the speed of the chargers. A quick test showed that Google will state whether the station can charge "slow," "medium," "fast," or "very fast."</p>

<p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartdroid.de/neu-in-google-maps-strassen-werden-jetzt-komplett-hervorgehoben-wie-bei-routen/">then reported</a> another update for Maps, which involves the app highlighting a street when searched. The deep blue highlight will span the entire length of the street, giving users a full understanding of it to plan their trips accordingly.</p><p>This is a useful change, considering Maps would previously drop a pin on the street without much context as to where it begins and ends.</p><p>We&apos;ve noticed both changes in our internal test, so more users should begin to spot them throughout the day.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-rolls-out-new-features-for-ev-owners">ambitions to improve</a> the EV experience in Maps were detailed in April. The company stated it plans to roll out accurate charging station information for drivers who may be running low on energy. Google plans to detail charging speeds, plug type, and more. So far, we&apos;re already seeing charging speeds, so the rest should surely begin to follow.</p>

<ul><li>The upcoming edit button for Google Messages has appeared properly in the app's latest beta.</li><li>Long-pressing a recently sent text will produce a pencil icon in the conversation, which users can tap to begin correcting any mistakes in the writing field.</li><li>The button's latest appearance comes with a change as users have a shorter 15 minutes to return to edit instead of 30.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A useful new feature for Google Messages has started appearing for a few of the app&apos;s beta testers.</p><p>According to a tip received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1788902138267193657">AssembleDebug</a> on X from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jhowkira2000/status/1788896324282094003">Jhow_Kira</a>, the latest Google Messages beta bears signs of its upcoming edit button (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-text-editing-live-for-beta-users-3441824/">Android Authority</a>). The appearance of the edit button seems scattered in the beta, as Kira states it has surfaced on an "older device" but not their current one.</p><p>Long-pressing your message will produce a pencil icon at the top of a conversation beside the "copy" button. Tapping it will prompt Messages to re-display your previous message in the writing area at the bottom. Above it, a banner that says "edit message" appears.</p><p>Testing showed that Google has lowered the editing time limit to 15 minutes, and the unedited (original) message now appears in its "message details." More importantly, the user stated that the editing feature needs two people to function in the beta.</p><p>Our internal test showed that the editing feature still functioned despite the other party not having it. However, it wasn&apos;t perfect. We noticed that when a message is edited, the old one disappears, and a new one is quickly added to the conversation with the corrections. Another test between a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> (which both have the feature) showed that editing a message will simply replace the old text with the new one within the same bubble.</p>

<p>Tapping the three-dot menu and selecting "view details" shows the editor the original message alongside their new choice. If the opposite party does not have access to the edit button in the beta, the details page will now offer any extra information.</p><p>AssembleDebug highlighted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/02/Google-Messages-Editing-RCS.html?m=1">previous discovery</a> of the edit feature in February, which mentioned a longer timeframe to return and correct mistakes. It seems Google is cutting back, dropping its time limit from 30 minutes to 15 minutes in the current beta.</p><p>While development seems nearly done, there&apos;s no telling when Google plans to roll out its edit button for Messages. Jhow_Kira added that the option has started appearing within the past week. For now, we&apos;ll have to wait and see where the company goes from here.</p><p>One thing is for sure: such a feature will bring Messages into closer competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">alternatives</a> like WhatsApp and Telegram.</p><p>We heard about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-text-editing-feature-spotted">text editing in Messages</a> in December during a much older app beta version. The APK teardown contained various strings that mentioned "enable edit UI," "load edit history," and more. Additional information in that old beta elaborated on Google&apos;s plans to process edited text messages for both users.</p>

<hr>
<p>Several of Samsung&apos;s older devices are having a happy Friday as the company&apos;s latest software glitches seem behind them.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/one-ui-6-1-update-brings-galaxy-ai-features-to-galaxy-s22-series-and-more/">Newsroom</a> post, Samsung has started rolling out its new One UI 6.1 update to the Galaxy S22 series. The two-year-old phones are joined by the Galaxy Z Flip 4, Fold 4, and the Tab S8 series. The Korean OEM adds that the rollout has restarted in the U.S. for all previously mentioned devices, meaning users should begin downloading it soon.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-one-ui-6-1-update-usa/">SamMobile</a> states that those with a Galaxy S22 on the AT&T network have started picking it up. The update will likely spread to other networks as the day progresses and into the weekend.</p><p>Galaxy AI is the game-changer for One UI 6.1, to which Samsung reiterated a few features users can expect on these 2022 devices.</p><p>The post states users will receive Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>, Chat Assist, Interpreter, Live Translate, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, Browsing Assist, Generative Edit, Edit Suggestion, and AI-generated wallpapers.</p><p>The company highlighted Galaxy AI&apos;s limited availability on devices like the Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3. Those devices are only primed to gain Circle to Search and Chat Assist features with the One UI 6.1 update.</p>

<p>Samsung initially started its One UI 6.1 rollout on 2022 devices at the top of May and had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-owners-may-have-to-wait-for-the-one-ui-61-update-a-bit-longer">stop it quickly</a> following glitches. Users in South Korea started reporting various problems, such as a persistent white screen after unlocking their phones. Another issue involved the Galaxy S22 becoming unresponsive on its lock screen.</p><p>The Korean OEM has been on a Galaxy AI kick, bringing its One UI 6.1 software to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">several past-gen devices</a> like the Galaxy S23 in March. Most of the AI&apos;s features are available, much like the Flip 5 and Fold 5. However, again, Samsung is advising consumers that this suite of features will remain free on supported Galaxy devices until the end of 2025.</p><p>Samsung plans to turn <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-plans-to-charge-for-certain-galaxy-ai-features-after-two-years">Galaxy AI into a paid service</a> once 2026 rolls in.</p>

<hr>
<p>It looks like Google&apos;s new Find My Device is starting to appear for folks outside of the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-network-slow-global-rollout-3441630/">Android Authority</a>), a few users have taken to X (formerly Twitter), and they&apos;ve reported receiving access to Google&apos;s new network for lost devices. A Japanese user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Nrnsasa5gmmwsub/status/1787430245035114727">posted a screenshot</a> of their Android picking up Find My Device, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/willza3/status/1788664718715916305">another user</a> from the U.K. posted similar examples.</p><p>However, with more users outside of North America picking it up, it seems Google is continuing to extend its network&apos;s reach <em>in </em>the U.S.</p><p>Android Central started noticing it on a base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> model while also receiving the notification for its arrival on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Moto Razr Plus</a>. Google began rolling out its new network on its l<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">atest Pixels in April</a>, and it seems this low rollout is starting to reach even more people.</p>

<p>Google explains that users can utilize its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device</a> network to rediscover their lost devices (e.g., phones) and accessories (e.g., earbuds). The company adds that a user&apos;s device location is encrypted using their screen lock and can only be seen by the owner. Similarly, if you share a device&apos;s location with another user, they will see it, too. Google states that users have the option to change this setting at any time.</p><p>Users will also have a few options for finding offline devices. In its settings, users will see "off," "without network," "high-traffic areas only," and "network in all areas." By default, the high-traffic area option is selected.</p><p>This choice works in places like airports or "busy footpaths."</p><p>It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the Pixel 8 features extra text that mentions finding a powered-off device or out of battery. Despite the Razr Plus receiving access, it cannot be found in either state on the new network.</p>

<p>A recent Google support document <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">detailed how</a> the offline tracking of the Pixel 8 series works. Essentially, users should ensure Bluetooth and Location services are toggled on <em>before </em>their Pixel 8 loses power and shuts down. The company added that that the devices can still transmit their location to a user for "several hours" after turning off.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> will receive such offline support. However, Google&apos;s wording doesn&apos;t explicitly say it won&apos;t.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024">I/O 2024</a> event is coming up on May 14.  While we&apos;re expecting to hear things about Android 15 and the next Pixels, there&apos;s a chance its new Find My Device network could make another appearance.</p>

<p>When the rumors began mounting about Google&apos;s return to the tablet market, I was beyond excited. I immediately thought back to the glory days of the Nexus 7 and hoped that it would spark some innovation. One could argue that Google delivered, as the Pixel Tablet doubles as a smart home hub. However, Google just proved that it doesn&apos;t really care, and neither should you. </p><p>Instead of waiting until I/O 2024, Google decided to announce the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-buy-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> and a price reduction (of sorts) for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. It&apos;s not actually lowering the price, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">you can finally just buy the tablet</a>, saving $100 and opting against having the Charging Speaker Dock at your disposal. Groundbreaking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUQDqvwpkTbGmKFm6Ld3hg" name="google-pixel-tablet-launch-io-2023-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Tablet specs launch at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUQDqvwpkTbGmKFm6Ld3hg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This kind of solves one of the biggest gripes that I had with the Pixel Tablet with its value proposition for the $499 price tag. For the most part, it&apos;s just a Pixel 5 that&apos;s been stretched to accommodate an 11-inch screen. Sure, it&apos;s great to have a 2560 x 1600 resolution, but Google skimped out by going with an LCD panel. </p><p>The 16:10 aspect ratio is great for using apps in split view and multitasking, but Google still doesn&apos;t sell a first-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-bluetooth-keyboards-google-pixel-tablet">keyboard case</a> or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-stylus-pixel-tablet">stylus</a>. Not to mention that the Pixel Tablet isn&apos;t great for gaming, as the LCD panel is locked to a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Admittedly, I don&apos;t often use the Pixel Tablet as a tablet. It remains docked 99% of the time, only to be removed when I need to update the software or the installed apps. I have to imagine that I&apos;m not the only one who opts for this use case and wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this is the case for a lot of people. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google could have made a smart decision, but instead, it decided to remain greedy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>However, I&apos;m only being further convinced that Google doesn&apos;t have much of a sense of direction with this product. Re-releasing the Pixel Tablet sans the Dock or any relevant first-party accessories roughly a year after the initial release has me wondering what in the world is happening. On top of that, the $399 price tag is still too damn high for what you&apos;re getting.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s a Pixel Tablet running Google&apos;s version of Android. But thanks to Google&apos;s own gate-keeping of features, it&apos;s running into the same problem as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. All of those cool AI features? Yeah, they have only recently started to become available on the Pixel Tablet. Hell, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> was announced at the start of 2024 and still won&apos;t be arriving for Pixel Tablet owners until "later this month."</p><p>I&apos;m not going to re-hash all of my feelings on that here, as I&apos;ve already done so a couple of times. But that doesn&apos;t negate the point that Google is lost, as it&apos;s pretty obvious that it&apos;s stretching itself in too many directions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y8XaQsd99heaGjD6ARqmcm" name="tshaka_pixel tab home dashboard.jpg" alt="pixel tablet home dashboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8XaQsd99heaGjD6ARqmcm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s all about AI and where Google can throw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> while blaming the hardware for those features not being available on a Google-released device. "Oh, it&apos;ll get there....eventually." Well, at least when Samsung or Apple says a new feature is coming, most of the time, those companies follow through.</p><p>This revelation about re-releasing the Pixel Tablet without the dock should&apos;ve happened already. By no means am I an analyst, but I have to assume that the dockless Pixel Tablet would&apos;ve been a hot-ticket item over the 2023 holidays. But instead, Google opted to throw it in as an afterthought when announcing a brand-new product.</p><p>I probably wouldn&apos;t feel the way I do if Google either held off on this tomfoolery until the G3 (or G4) Pixel Tablet was ready or lowered the price to around $299. To put this into perspective, take a look at what Amazon did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> tablet. For about $285, you can get the Fire Max 11, bundled with the Amazon Stylus Pen <em>and</em> the Keyboard Case. Oh, and that&apos;s with paying extra for the "Without Lockscreen Ads" version. </p>

<p>With the Pixel Tablet, you&apos;ll pay $399 and get a charging cable, along with some regulatory paperwork. Not to mention that despite being rumored since last year, there aren&apos;t any new first-party accessories. It&apos;s beyond frustrating to see these decisions being made, especially when it&apos;s so obvious that they&apos;re wearing blinders and can&apos;t see the forest for the trees.</p><p>I&apos;ve just about lost hope in Google&apos;s product strategy, and maybe I should just give it up. It&apos;s apparent that Google has, and I won&apos;t be surprised if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a> never sees the light of day. </p>
