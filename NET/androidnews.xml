These releases also serve as a way to deliver feedback to the brand over the latest additions heading to Android.</p><p>Google introduced the first preview build of Android 15 at the end of February, and followed it up with DP2 on March 21. Google rolled out the first public beta of Android 15 on April 11, following up with the second beta build on May 14 at its annual I/O event. </p><p>I installed the second public Android 15 beta on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> as soon as it became available, and I&apos;ve been testing it a few days now. While there wasn&apos;t a lot of excitement around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, there&apos;s plenty of new stuff in Android 15.</p><p>That said, a word of caution: the build is much more stable than earlier releases, but it isn&apos;t ready to be used as a daily driver as of now. I believe that will change with the next beta release — which is due in June — so if you&apos;re itching to try out the new features, you&apos;ll only need to wait a little while. With that out of the way, here&apos;s what&apos;s new in Android 15.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-release-timeline"><span>Android 15 release timeline</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog" name="android-15-schedule.jpg" alt="Android 15 release schedule" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a clearly defined timeline with its Android releases, and that&apos;s no different with Android 15. The preview builds ran until March, and we&apos;re now in the public beta testing phase of Android 15. With Google planning four builds, the beta window will run until July. </p><p>The stable build follows soon after, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> debuted in the month of August, Android 14 was delayed until October last year. That said, it is likely that Google will go back to its usual cadence this year, so a stable build should be available in August — I&apos;ll have more to share as we get more details.</p><p>While Google doesn&apos;t use codenames in public-facing documentation, all Android releases still have internal dessert codenames, and Android 15 is designated Vanilla Ice Cream. Like previous years, you can install the beta on Google devices, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5-review">Pixel 5</a> series isn&apos;t eligible — only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and upwards will pick up the update. Here&apos;s the list of devices:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>With the second public beta build, the Android beta program is making its way to the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, with most major manufacturers getting in on the action. If you have any of the eligible devices listed below, you can get started with Android 15 right now: </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://developer.honor.com/en/docs/11100/guides/android_15_beta_guide">Honor</a>: Honor Magic 6 Pro, Honor Magic V2</li><li><a href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/guidance/androidtbeta">Xiaomi</a>: Xiaomi 14, Xiaomi 13T Pro, Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro 12.4</li><li><a href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1595803862105587712">OnePlus</a>: OnePlus 12, OnePlus Open</li><li>OPPO: Find X7</li><li><a href="https://developer.vivo.com/promotion/android15">Vivo</a>: Vivo X100</li><li><a href="https://developer.vivo.com/promotion/android15">iQOO</a>: iQOO 12</li><li><a href="https://nothing.community/d/10106-android-15-developer-preview-program-beta-1">Nothing</a>: Nothing Phone 2a</li><li><a href="https://c.realme.com/in/post-details/1790269629646561280">Realme</a>: Realme 12 Pro+ 5G</li><li><a href="https://dev.lenovo.com/android15">Lenovo</a>: Lenovo Tab Extreme</li><li><a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android15_betaprogram/">Sharp</a>: Sharp Aquos sense8</li><li><a href="https://tspot.tecno.com/#/detail?tid=411927">Tecno</a>: Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G</li></ul>
<p>As usual, Samsung devices aren&apos;t on the list, and ASUS is a notable omission. If you have a Galaxy phone, you will need to wait several months before you can use Android 15; Samsung tends to roll out the beta once the next version of One UI is ready. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-private-space-gives-you-an-additional-layer-of-security"><span>Private Space gives you an additional layer of security</span></h2>
<p>This feature has been around on several Chinese skins, and I use it quite a bit whenever I&apos;m testing a phone running ColorOS. And with Android 15, Google is integrating Private Space into Android, so it will be available on all devices. </p><p>The feature allows you to lock sensitive apps locked away in a separate section that needs an additional layer of authentication. Once locked, these apps don&apos;t show up in the app drawer or the overview menu, and they&apos;re squirreled away inside a new user profile. Any data that&apos;s generated — photos, videos, and documents — is also hidden. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-notification-cooldown-turns-down-the-noise"><span>Notification cooldown turns down the noise</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg" name="android-15-notifications.jpg" alt="Android 15 notification cooldown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notification cooldown is a great new feature that lowers the volume of incoming notifications when you get successive notifications from the same app. So if you&apos;re in a group chat and start getting constant notifications, Android 15 automatically lowers the volume of subsequent notifications. What&apos;s great is that you can select this setting for just conversations, or all apps. As someone who doesn&apos;t like getting many notification alerts (I use DND most of the day), this is a great new addition, and one that I will use to good effect.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-keyboard-vibration-gets-its-own-toggle"><span>Keyboard vibration gets its own toggle</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof" name="android-15-keyboard.jpg" alt="Android 15 keyboard vibration toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 is adding a system-wide toggle to enable or disable keyboard vibration. You could do this previously by going into a keyboard&apos;s settings and toggle the feature individually, but the option to do so at a system-wide level that works across keyboards is a good addition. Google is also integrating a slider that lets you adjust the intensity of haptic feedback, similar to what OPPO and other brands already do.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-brightness-slider-vibrates-now"><span>The brightness slider vibrates now</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff" name="android-15-brightness.jpg" alt="Android 15 brightness slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a bid to bring better feedback across the system, Google is adding haptic feedback to the brightness slider in Android 15. The effect is very subtle — it&apos;s not on the same level as the nav gesture intensity, but it is still great that you get some amount of feedback when adjusting the brightness.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-partial-screen-recording-lets-you-share-only-what-s-needed"><span>Partial screen recording lets you share only what's needed</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9AqLjyR8TTy32ofebF9P9h" name="android-15-record.jpg" alt="Android 15 screen record" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9AqLjyR8TTy32ofebF9P9h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google took its sweet time integrating a screen recorder into Android, and by the time it added it, all other brands had their own take on the feature, which was usually better. Anyway, Android 15 is getting an update that lets you take partial screen recording. Instead of recording the entire screen by default, you can now select to record an individual app, and it won&apos;t show the rest of the screen and notifications.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bluetooth-tile-is-actually-useful"><span>Bluetooth tile is actually useful</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qQ3JfHpNrxcsMWgr33tNQf" name="android-15-bluetooth.jpg" alt="Android 15 Bluetooth tile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQ3JfHpNrxcsMWgr33tNQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google moved the Wi-Fi and cellular connection tiles to a single tile called Internet, and it is a constant source of frustration as it adds another step if I just want to toggle my home internet on or off. By contrast, the Bluetooth tile — which could have actually benefitted with this functionality — was a standard toggle that turned the Bluetooth radio or on off.</p><p>Thankfully, Google is addressing this issue in Android 15, and a short press on the Bluetooth tile now pulls up a dialog box similar to the Internet one — you get to see your paired devices, and you have the ability to easily switch between devices, and there&apos;s the option to toggle Bluetooth connectivity. If you want to pair a new device, hitting the + icon at the bottom of the dialog box to pull up the Bluetooth settings page and connect a new device.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s One UI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> already use this system, and it&apos;s good to see Google baking it into Android.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-enables-edge-to-edge-displays"><span>Android 15 enables edge-to-edge displays</span></h3>
<p>With Android 15, apps can show content that covers the entire width of the display, so if you have the gesture recognition bar enabled at the bottom of the page, you&apos;ll see content on either side of it. This should make content look a little more immersive — particularly when you&apos;re using a tablet.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-continuity-and-multitasking-on-foldables"><span>Better continuity and multitasking on foldables</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is lifting a feature that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> that switches whatever action you&apos;re doing on the inner screen to the cover screen when you fold a device. This is a very useful feature, and other foldables like the Honor Magic V2 also have it. With it being integrated into Android 15, we should see it heading to even more foldables in the future.</p><p>Multitasking is also getting an upgrade, and you can now save split-screen app combinations to launch both at the same time. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-should-have-better-optimization"><span>Android 15 should have better optimization</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AxWTrfRYJAJ7DLJEZoxu5g" name="android-15-home.jpg" alt="Android 15 home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AxWTrfRYJAJ7DLJEZoxu5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is making it easier for game and app makers to directly access the hardware, and the Android Dynamic Performance Framework consists of a set of APIs that allow better optimization, and in Android 15, Google is introducing a power-efficiency mode that&apos;s designed for "long-running background workloads." This is to ensure any background apps don&apos;t utilize more system resources than necessary.</p><p>In a similar vein, Google is rolling out new thermal thresholds that should make a difference with throttling. Even the latest phones with powerful hardware struggle with throttling issues in demanding titles, and I&apos;m excited to see if this change makes a difference in real-world use.</p><p>And as for the interface as a whole, Google is adding smoother transitions, so Android 15 should feel fluid if you&apos;re on a device that has a high refresh panel.  </p>

<p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-your-android-phone-webcam-your-pc">use your phone as a webcam</a>, and with Android 15, Google is rolling out an HQ mode that makes a difference to video quality. There&apos;s now a toggle that lets you enable HQ mode, and it offers better detail resolution. The only issue is that your device will get noticeably warm, but it is a nice addition nevertheless</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-has-an-always-active-taskbar"><span>Android 15 has an always-active taskbar</span></h3>

<p>Android 15 DP2 brings a new feature to the Pixel Fold and Android tablets that enables a persistent taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Other brands offer this feature as standard on their foldables, so it is good to see Google adding it natively in Android 15. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-lets-you-share-audio-like-its-the-90s"><span>Android 15 lets you share audio like its the '90s</span></h3>

<p>Another new feature in Android 15 DP2 is the ability to pay the same audio across multiple headphones — no need to share earbuds. The Audio sharing sub-menu is located within the Connected devices page, and it lets you cast music to more than one Bluetooth device at a time. I wasn&apos;t able to get this feature to work just yet, but it should be usable in later builds. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-features-i-want-to-see"><span>Android 15 features I want to see</span></h3>

<p>The best part of Android is its sheer diversity; different brands have their own take on what Android should look like, and they roll out custom features that go above and beyond what Google offers on the Pixels. As I get to use all the flavors of Android, these are the features I want to see in Android 15 — that said, it&apos;s unlikely Google will include any of these in upcoming builds.</p>
<h2 id="floating-windows-2">Floating windows</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8" name="android-15-list-6.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ColorOS and MIUI rolled out floating windows three years ago, and it is a useful utility that lets you maximize screen real estate. Floating windows essentially lets you resize any app so that it fits on the display without taking up its entire width, and it can be overlaid onto another app, making it quite convenient to use. My best use case is launching the calculator in a floating window whenever I need to add up a few things, and it works exceedingly well in this situation.</p><p>If Google is looking to add floating windows to Android 15, it should consider looking at ColorOS&apos; implementation and not MIUI. In all its wisdom, Xiaomi thought it best to have floating windows enabled as default, with no way to turn off the feature. This means that whenever you pull down on a notification, it opens in a floating window, and I&apos;ve had several instances over the years where I inadvertently launched floating windows without meaning to.</p>
<h2 id="better-icon-customization-2">Better icon customization</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7" name="android-15-list-2.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google introduced themed icons in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> (albeit in beta), and two years after launch, the feature is still half-baked at best. The problem isn&apos;t down to Google, but devs — as this feature isn&apos;t mandated, most app makers still choose to ignore it, and it makes the home screen look less cohesive. Even well-known services like Evernote don&apos;t offer the feature, and while that&apos;s more to do with the state of Evernote, it&apos;s annoying to not have all icons utilize the feature.</p><p>While Google&apos;s at it, if it can roll out the ability to change icon shape and size, that would be fantastic. I&apos;m still annoyed at how little customization is available on a Pixel phone in this particular regard, and really needs to do better.</p>
<h2 id="screen-distance-2">Screen Distance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7" name="android-15-list-3.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Screen Distance is a clever new feature in iOS 17 that utilizes the front camera to determine if you&apos;re holding your phone too close to your eyes. The goal here is to reduce eye strain, and if the camera detects that you&apos;re using your device closer than 12 inches from your face, it triggers a full-screen alert asking you to move your phone or tablet further away.</p><p>This feature proved to be quite useful on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I found that I had a tendency to hold the phone a little closer at night. Screen Distance is designed to reduce risk of myopia in children, but if you tend to use your phone in bed a lot, it can be quite a handy tool. Google needs to bring a similar utility to Android, and given that it uses the camera to gauge distance, it shouldn&apos;t be hard to implement.</p>
<h2 id="better-always-on-display-2">Better Always On Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8" name="android-15-list-4.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s take on an Always On Display has always been lackluster, and Android 14 doesn&apos;t do much to change that. You only get the option to show time and date when choosing an always-on screen, and while you get notification icons at the bottom, there isn&apos;t any customization possible.</p><p>Other interfaces, meanwhile, offer extensive customizability in this area. I like the range of styles available in ColorOS and the fact that I can design my own pattern that shows up on the lock screen, and while One UI doesn&apos;t offer much out of the box, you can always install Good Lock and unlock a slate of customization options.</p>
<h2 id="app-cloning-2">App cloning</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8" name="android-15-list-5.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android brands give you the option to clone an app so you can run two instances of it. This is handy if you&apos;ve got two SIM cards and want to fully utilize messaging services like WhatsApp or Telegram, but you don&apos;t have the ability to do so on a Pixel phone. As it usually does, Google teased this feature in earlier Android 14 beta builds, but it was nowhere to be found in subsequent betas, and is missing on the stable version.</p>

<p>The Android 15 beta program is in high gear, and it&apos;s clear that it is a major release with plenty of great new features. </p><p>With the beta builds now available on devices outside the Google ecosystem, you can get started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">installing Android 15</a> right now. I&apos;d advise waiting until beta 3 — that&apos;s when the build usually hits platform stability, and is much more reliable. </p>

<ul><li>Following an interview with Google's Dave Burke, it seems that a previous demonstration of ChromeOS on Android was nothing more than a demo.</li><li>It appears as though the company was interested in seeing if the capability for Android to run ChromeOS through its AVF could work — and it can.</li><li>A previous demo was reportedly shown to corporate partners in private using a Pixel 8's display output capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is dashing any hope of ChromeOS arriving on Android as an interview with a notable member suggests it was just a test.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-on-android-proof-of-concept-3443722/">(Android Authority</a>), an interview with Google&apos;s Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Android detailed what&apos;s happening with ChromeOS and Android. Burke said that the company&apos;s "tech demo" of the Ferrochrome project was aimed to see its virtualization technology in action.</p><p>Burke added that the software could only get off the ground thanks to the AVF (android virtualization framework) introduced in Android 13. This framework delivered a safe environment for "highly" sensitive code.</p><p>What Google was playtesting was the secure computing side of Android. As Burke stated, most of it is reportedly done through TrustZone, which isn&apos;t "as safe as virtual machines." While TrustZone typically works off ARM CPUs, the virtual machines are a "cleaner, safer way to run compartmentalized secure code."</p><p>The tech demo was done through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, a software that Google has updated with a new AVF to run its graphical operating systems through a virtual machine. This capability comes with GPU acceleration, as well. However, the test was just a proof of concept to see if such capabilities <em>could </em>exist.</p><p>Google&apos;s Sameer Samat chimed in, stating that things often "start like this" at the company. Unfortunately, it seems anyone&apos;s hopes of ChromeOS on Android are squandered as Google has no plans of continuing — at least, for now.</p>

The demo showcased the latest Pixel flagship utilizing its display output functionality through the OS.</p><p>There wasn&apos;t much else shown during the event aside from the device&apos;s (and the software&apos;s) capability to run the computing software.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re still busy unpacking all that Google had in store for I/O 2024, and this next bit stems from its "Android Health" segment.</p><p>The company is highlighting another string of updates that are primed for its Android health sector for users in a Developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/the-latest-updates-from-android-health-io-2024.html">blog post</a>. Google&apos;s Health Connect is preparing to pick up support for background and history reads. Regarding the former, the post states that the developer-focused feature will give their app the ability to read Health Connect data when in the background.</p><p>Google states that this will enable a developer&apos;s app to keep a user&apos;s information up-to-date without manual input from the user.</p><p>History reads enters as a feature that gives a developer&apos;s app some context so it&apos;s not starting from zero. Google states users will have the option to grant an app access to their historical data in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a>. This is said to stretch beyond just the past 30 days.</p><p>While users may find both features useful, Google adds that developers must declare the permissions for them to appear. Users can accept or decline these permissions as Google ensures they control the data they share. If users no longer want to allow background or history reads, the options can be found in Health Connect&apos;s settings.</p><p>Google plans to roll out both new features for user data "later this year."</p>

Although the S8 Ultra is a last-generation device, this is a good way to get a more affordable Samsung tablet than the pricey S9 Ultra.</p><p>When you buy the discounted S8 Ultra from Best Buy, you can also get bonus gifts of a free one-month membership of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, three months of Google One and YouTube Premium, and Norton 360 Internet Security protection for three devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</a> is certainly one of the more expensive tablets out there, even despite being Samsung's last-generation premium offering. However, with 36% off the normal purchase price, buyers could stand to get a pretty great deal on this capable device.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s8/buy">Samsung - $1,099.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-14-6-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6494238.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="258668e6-81a0-4af3-b462-228112d6d21b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a high-performing tablet at a slightly lower price; you&apos;re looking for a tablet with a large screen that&apos;s still slim and lightweight; having a tablet that can run some games is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for the latest-generation tablet available and wouldn&apos;t mind paying more for the S9 Ultra;  you need a tablet with a 3.5mm jack.</p><p>Despite its age, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Ultra is a remarkably strong tablet, offering 8GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, along with a massive 11,200mAh battery. All of these make it able to handle most gaming applications, and the 14.6-inch Super AMOLED is great for everything from video streaming to working in the office (or maybe both at the same time).</p><p>While many of Samsung&apos;s devices land in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, most are from the company&apos;s newest generation. But if you don&apos;t mind going with the older generation and you go with this deal, you&apos;ll get a tablet that&apos;s almost as good as the S9 Ultra—without the $1,199.99 price tag.</p>

You sit at the table as you might any other desk or conference room table and talk to the person (or people) on the other end, but the trick is that Starline isn’t just a flat screen. It’s a Lightwave projection that displays a 3D projection of the person on the other end, a realism I simply wasn’t prepared for.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-starline-hp-partnership/">HP recently recognized</a> Starline’s impressive nature and possibilities in this world of remote work and cross-continental business opportunities, but Starline represents more than just the future of connecting offices for better remote meetings. It goes hand-in-hand with other projects Google showed off at Google I/O 2024, like Project Astra, a new AI routine built on Gemini that can see the real world and talk to you about it as if it were another person looking at the same things.</p><p>We’ve seen Meta launch this kind of technology already on its excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, but Google’s tech takes this a step further by not only making things even more conversational but also by adding memory to the experience. No, I don’t mean RAM or storage. I mean, the AI can remember what it has seen and recall facts and details as if it were a living being.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You get a brief glimpse of the Google engineer wearing the AR glasses prototype in the Astra demo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say Google is working on a lot of different projects right now is an understatement. The company talked about what felt like an endless supply of Gemini-related AI projects during its Google I/O 2024 keynote, but one project was purposefully glossed over to make sure we were paying attention.</p><p>We’re still not sure if this is the pair of Google AR glasses that were previously thought to be canceled, but Google certainly demoed a pair of AR glasses with multimodal Astra AI built in.</p><p>While I didn’t get to demo the glasses myself, I did get to check out Project Astra in person using a single camera and a large touchscreen TV.</p><p>The demo consisted of four different sections: storytelling, alliteration, Pictionary, and free form. During the storytelling portion, we were able to place stuffed animals within the line of sight of the camera, and the AI would then come up with a story about each animal on the fly. The stories were surprisingly convincing and, if nothing, would make a fantastic children’s book.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ" name="google-project-astra-storytelling.jpg" alt="Demoing Google Project Astra's vision capabilities at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alliteration builds upon the storytelling by confining the AI to only use the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words for its stories. In Pictionary, you use the touch screen to draw something, and the AI has to guess what it is. This was another particularly impressive one, as there seemed to be no real limitation between what you could draw and what the AI might guess.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Project Astra is not only able to identify what it sees on a camera but can also remember them for an indefinite period of time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While all three of these modes were impressive and interesting in and of themselves, the free-form mode allows you to do anything with the AI, including recreating the other three modes by giving it a simple voice command. Free form mode is what particularly interested me because of its ability to not only correctly identify what Astra sees through the camera but also the AI’s ability to remember what it saw and recall the information quickly in a later conversation.</p><p>During the keynote, the most impressive example of Astra’s use was asking where the narrator’s glasses were in the room. Astra remembered the previous location of objects, even when those objects weren’t interacted with. In the case of the video, the person demoing the tech never interacted with the glasses until she asked Astra where they were last seen.</p><p>It’s this kind of technology that I can see making a real and meaningful difference in the lives of people who not only need vision assistance - Google’s Guided Frame on Pixel phones and Meta’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">multimodal AI on Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> already do this to some extent - but it will create very real quality of life improvements in the lives of its wearers in subtle ways.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Spatial memory is something once reserved for living things and it creates an entirely new paradigm in AI learning.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Being able to find your glasses or car keys by just asking an AI built into a pair of smart glasses is game-changing, and it will create an almost symbiotic relationship between the person, the AI, and the AI itself.</p><p>Aside from battery life limitations, though, there are storage limitations. Remembering where objects are, and all the spatial data associated with that virtual memory takes up a lot of drive space. Google reps told me there’s theoretically no limitation on how long Astra can remember spaces and things, but the company will scale memory limitations depending on the product using them.</p><p>The demo I used had a memory of only one minute, so by the time I moved on to the next scenario, it had already forgotten what we had previously taught it.</p>

<p>I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">interviewed Meta’s head of AR development</a>, Caitlin Kalinowski, to discuss Meta’s upcoming AR glasses and how they’ll improve the experience versus current AR products. While she didn’t directly say that the glasses were using light-field displays, the description of how Meta&apos;s AR glasses overlay virtual objects on the real world sounded at least somewhat similar to what I experienced from Project Starline at Google I/O 2024.</p><p>Starline delivers an incredibly impressive, lifelike 3D projection of the person on the other end that moves and looks like that person is sitting across the table from you. I gave my presenter a high-five "through" the display during the demo, and my hand tingled in a way that said my brain was expecting a physical hand to hit mine. It was convincing from every angle, something that&apos;s possible thanks to Starline&apos;s use of six high-resolution cameras placed at various angles around the display&apos;s frame.</p><p>If Meta or Google can compress this experience into a pair of glasses, we&apos;ll have something truly reality-altering in a way we haven&apos;t seen before from technology.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab" name="google-project-starline-call.gif" alt="Talking to someone on Project Starline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>I gave my presenter a high-five "through" the display during the demo and my hand tingled in a way that said my brain was expecting a physical hand to hit mine.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As with anything AR or VR-related, it&apos;s impossible to capture imagery of what Project Starline felt like using traditional cameras and displays. You can see a picture — or even a moving image like you see above — of someone sitting at a Starline booth and recognize that they&apos;re talking to another person, but you don&apos;t <em>truly</em> understand what it feels like until you experience it in person with your own eyes.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever used a Nintendo 3DS, you&apos;ll have at least a passing idea of what this feels like. The display is wholly convincing and, unlike the 3DS, is high resolution enough so that you&apos;re not counting pixels or even worried about the tech behind the experience at all.</p>

<p>Google representatives told me that while the technology behind Starline is still secretive, more will be revealed soon. For now, I was only told that Starline&apos;s light-field technology was "a new way to compute" that didn&apos;t involve traditional GPUs, rasterizers, or other similar methods of virtually rendering a scene.</p><p>Rather, the light-field tech you see in front of you is a clever amalgam of footage from the six cameras onboard, all stitched together in real-time and moving according to your <strong>personal perspective</strong> in front of it. Again, this is a bit like the revision of the 3DS with the front-facing camera that allowed you to shift your perspective a bit, just all grown up and running on supercharged hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL" name="Ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai.jpg" alt="Multimodal AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe more impressively is the technology&apos;s ability to create a 3D avatar complete with real-time backgrounds. Forget those terrible cutouts you see on a Zoom call; these were moving, authentic-looking backgrounds that seamlessly blended the person into them, even creating real-time shadows and other effects to make it even more convincing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Imagine being able to see and share experiences with a volumetric display, letting you actually feel like something is right in front of you even if it's thousands of miles away (or not even real at all).</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For me, this kind of thing is a dream come true for the work-from-home lifestyle. If this technology were to be implemented on a pair of AR glasses like the ones Google or Meta are building, it would be easy to work from <em>anywhere</em> without losing that "professionalism" that some people feel only comes from working in an office. It would also make sharing things with distant relatives and friends a substantially more rewarding and memorable experience for everyone.</p><p>This, paired with a remember-all AI like Astra, would certainly help meld the physical and digital worlds like never before. While companies like Meta have often waxed poetic about ideas like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">the Metaverse</a> in the past, I saw the genuine article — the future of augmented reality — coming to life at Google I/O this year.</p><p>It&apos;s amazing to dream up science fiction ideas that seem at least remotely possible, but it&apos;s another to see them come to life before your eyes. And that, for me, was what made Google I/O 2024 a truly memorable year.</p>

<p>Tello is a T-Mobile-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that&apos;s known for offering custom-built data plans that give you exactly what you need (and nothing else) for as little as $5 per month. They&apos;re also home to four pre-built data plans for the folks who don&apos;t want to customize their phone bill. </p><p>Three of Tello&apos;s plans are eligible for the $50 off deal: the Value plan ($14 per month), the Smart plan ($19 per month), and the Unlimited plan ($25 per month). The Value and Smart plan come with unlimited talk and text plus 5GB and 10GB of data, respectively. The Unlimited plan probably offers the best bang for the buck here, though, with 35GB of high-speed monthly data from T-Mobile before speeds start to slow. </p><p>This offer from Tello Mobile may not be for everyone, but if you want great T-Mobile coverage and a reliable, no-frills smartphone, it&apos;s a solid way to save some cash. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google is launching a new program today (May 16) that will partner more closely with the disability community across the United States.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/gaad-2024-community-partnerships/">blog post</a>, the company is introducing the "Google&apos;s Rising Influencers with Disabilities Fellowship," or GRID, for short. This six-month fellowship program will help Google create a "sense of belonging" online for creators and influencers with disabilities.</p><p>The GRID program will cover "key skills" for digital creators, industry leader-provided lessons, and a direct line to Google&apos;s product teams. Google is also giving new creators/influencers who are getting into GRID a chance to work with pre-established creators with disabilities in a mentorship capacity.</p><p>Across the country, the program is said to include fifteen fellowships.</p><p>Among those Google partners with for GRID is the USABA (U.S. Association of Blind Athletes). Through this, the company states it will provide Pixel phones, leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi Wireless</a>, and other company-made tools to those who are blind or with low vision. This pertains to those enrolled in the USABA Sport Ambassador program.</p>

<p>Google highlights the expansion of support for product accessibility by announcing the opening of a discovery center in Zurich, Switzerland.  The company hopes to bring more attention to how it implements accessibility features into its products through this center. Zurich is the third and joins the likes of the London Discovery Center and Dublin.</p><p>Supporting companies and programs investing in computer science education leads Google to reveal its $5 million fund toward those places. The post states that the fund will deliver grants to programs utilizing Google&apos;s Blocky open-source library to create teaching material. Blocky features accessibility tools like keyboard navigation plugins alongside other "themes" to help the visually impaired, such as color blindness or low vision. These programs are said to support the education of students with disabilities who are interested in coding and computer science.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today is Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and Google is announcing a few new features that aim to make its products and services more accessible to all. There are eight in total, and these new accessibility features come on the heels of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-io-2024">Google I/O 2024</a>, the company&apos;s annual developer conference. At that event, Google shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Gemini AI will be used to improve TalkBack on Android</a>. Now, we know more about how Google is going to improve the accessibility of some of its other services, like Google Maps and Lookout. </p><p>The first is something called "Find mode," and it is a new functionality added to Lookout. For those unfamiliar, Lookout is an Android feature that helps people with low vision or blindness use their phone&apos;s camera to learn more about the world around them. Starting today in beta, Find mode will make it possible for users to search for specific objects or places via Lookout. Users can pick one of seven categories of places, like restrooms, and be informed of their direction and distance to the place. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR" name="Find-Mode-Beta-Lookout.jpg" alt="Find Mode in Lookout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTDRqSpkHrVFHYvdNucjkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is also adding a new option to Look to Speak, a feature that lets users trigger pre-written phrases to be spoken aloud with their eyes. Now, there&apos;s an alternative to text, as you can select emojis to communicate. The company says it&apos;s intended to make Look to Speak more accessible to people across languages, literacy challenges, and cognitive differences. </p><p>Project Gameface, an experimental software that lets users control their cursors with head motions and facial expressions, is rolling out to Android this week in another move. </p><p>Some of the bigger changes come to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, which will become more accessible for people with low vision or blindness. For starters, Lens in Google Maps now has a screen reader, so the app can tell you the name and details of locations around you. It&apos;s rolling out this month to both iOS and Android users of the Google Maps app. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hFR48buiix3bdGhANJNSJ6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-4-google-maps-02.jpg" alt="Viewing Google Maps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4's smaller cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFR48buiix3bdGhANJNSJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Maps also has more information about the accessibility of business and places you might want to visit. The company says it has info for 50 million places, and users can view accessibility details in the About tab for a place, like whether it has an accessible ramp or restroom. For theaters and showrooms, there is now an Auracast support option that can be displayed to show compatibility with Bluetooth hearing aids.</p><p>There are a few more accessibility features coming to Android, too. Project Relate allows users to create a custom speech recognition model that will help people with non-standard speech be better understood. Sound Notifications will inform you that an important household sound is happening, like a fire alarm, through push notifications, flashing lights, and vibrations. </p><p>These changes are all rolling out now or soon, and they should help make Android and other Google services more accessible. For Global Accessibility Awareness Day, other tech companies are also debuting new accessibility features, like Apple&apos;s Eye Tracking for iPhone and iPad. </p>

Ultimately, I would just go back to using foobar2000 or MediaMonkey and manually play back whatever album I want to listen to. Over the years, I used a variety of media players and organizers, but most of them ended up either being buggy or too convoluted that I often spent most of the time tinkering with the settings instead of listening to music.</p>

<p>So when I heard about Roon, I figured it might just be the solution I was looking for. I was skeptical of the service initially; it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://account.roon.app/en/create">costs $15 a month</a>, $129 annually, or you can get a lifetime license by shelling out $829 — I thought that was an absurd amount of cash for what is basically a glorified music player.</p><p>Roon isn&apos;t a music streaming service; it is instead designed to work with the music you already have, so if you don&apos;t have a sizeable offline music collection, you won&apos;t get much use out of the software. As a high-level overview, Roon is a music management service that organizes your media library, and it easily lets you stream content to connected devices, including Cast-enabled products.</p><p>As the pricing suggests, the service is clearly aimed at enthusiasts, and it has a lot of prerequisites. You need to set it up on a NAS server, and an SSD is mandatory — it isn&apos;t designed to be run on mechanical HDDs. You don&apos;t need to store your music library on an SSD; that can still be on a regular HDD, but Roon&apos;s database needs to be installed on an SSD. </p>

<p>After you configure the software and point it to your music library, it does the rest: cataloging your music library, sorting albums and bands into categories, adding metadata, classifying music into genres, and so much more. What I like about Roon is the detailed information you get on each artist; it&apos;s how I found out that Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk made an orchestral score called Mythologies (which is brilliant).</p><p>Another nifty trick is that Roon doesn&apos;t change any of the file metadata itself — it just creates an overlay based on the albums in your library, and that again is markedly different to how other media players work. But the best part about the service is that it removes a lot of the friction involved in maintaining a music library, and that alone justifies the asking price.</p><p>There are plenty of other niceties: if you use Tidal, Qobuz, or KKBox, you can link these services via Roon, and it creates a seamless blend of online and local streaming that just makes a lot of sense. Roon uses a custom signal path to deliver bit-perfect audio, and the sound engine has a ton of useful additions, including a DSP engine, EQ, presets, and unique filters.</p>

<p>I use Roon with my Windows machine that&apos;s connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze&apos;s MM-500 headset</a>, and it is a terrific combination. The service is great at discovering new music, but what I like best is that it makes playing music across various devices extremely easy; I have a lot of eclectic audio gear that&apos;s connected via Chromecast Audio and WiiM streamers, and Roon lets me select the device I want to cast to in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Roon Arc is a relatively recent addition that enables these features on the go, unlocking the ability to stream your local music library over the internet. What makes a greater difference in my use case is Roon Ready; this feature allows Roon to be integrated into network streamers and digital audio players, and I use it extensively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">Fiio M11S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-r7-review">R7</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the ease of use combined with the interface and detailed notes make Roon stand out from other media players. There is a high barrier to entry, but having used the service for just over 15 months, I can&apos;t see myself switching to anything else.</p>
