<hr>
<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oppo-find-n5-and-oneplus-open-2-should-have-samsung-and-google-worried">OPPO Find N5 launch just around the corner</a>, the company's head honcho shared a sneak peek at a new handy feature: remote Mac control.</p><p>Pete Lau, OPPO’s chief product officer, teased a standout software feature for their upcoming foldable. In a post on X, he revealed that the Find N5 will let users remotely control their Mac, making it easy to view and edit files on the go.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tech should make life easy and seamless. That’s why we’ve developed a system for the #OPPOFindN5 to remotely control your Mac—enabling real-time file viewing and editing, enhancing your productivity, and ensuring smoother interaction between devices.More details coming at our… pic.twitter.com/qO5mNHWIXD<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1891376292827938871">February 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This feature isn’t exactly a surprise. OPPO’s ColorOS design director, Chen Xi, had already hinted at it by sharing a Weibo post showing a macOS desktop mirrored on a partially folded Find N5. In the image, the top half of the device displayed the macOS screen, while the bottom half functioned as a keyboard.</p><p>Lau’s latest teaser featured an image of the Find N5 hooked up to a MacBook. The phone’s screen showed a “Remote PC Control” menu, with a connected Mac seemingly tied to the same account as the Find N5.</p><p>The Find N5’s remote control menu suggests it can handle multiple connected devices. At the same time, the Mac’s screen confirms the link, allowing file access from the Find N5. Pete Lau is set to reveal more details about this feature at a February 20 event, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">the Find N5 is scheduled to debut</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="5ta7aTwD7nkp2qGZ6zgdTV" name="Oppo-Find-N5-Mac-remote-control" alt="A feature for the OPPO Find N5 to remotely control your Mac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ta7aTwD7nkp2qGZ6zgdTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pete Lau / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This feature goes beyond just mirroring a Mac’s screen on the Find N5—it also lets users control the computer remotely.</p><p>From what Xi revealed earlier, this feature seems to build on the "O+ interconnection" tech (machine translated). That probably ties into O+ Connect, an app already out there for iOS that lets OPPO and OnePlus phones swap files at speeds rivaling AirDrop.</p><p>While the Find N5 is bringing some fresh ideas to the table, it’s not the first Android device to pull off remote macOS control. Vivo’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android phones</a>, including its foldables, have been doing this in China for a while thanks to the OriginOS skin. So, OPPO’s stepping into some already-tested territory.</p><p>Since Lau has been hyping this feature to a global crowd, it’s a safe bet that OPPO will roll it out in international versions of the Find N5. And why not? It’s shaping up to be a killer productivity tool for all kinds of scenarios.</p>

<p>OnePlus has put more effort into creating larger batteries that don't take much space, i.e., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">its new Glacier technology</a>. The Chinese OEM discussed this new tech last summer, stating it leverages a "silicon carbon anode" to produce batteries with 6,000mAh or even 6,100mAh capacities. These new batteries support the company's 100W fast charging with the promise of holding at 80% battery health after four years.</p><p>This tech was packed into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-pro-announced-in-china">OnePlus Ace 3 Pro</a> and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> model.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that while OnePlus is taking strides to further improve its batteries, Samsung is (just now) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">trying to catch up</a>. The company is reportedly looking into silicon-carbon batteries for its next wave of Galaxy S phones, which have become notably stagnant regarding their battery and (the same old) 45W charging speed.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-mini-camera-bar-dual-specs-rumored">rumors of a "mini"</a> OnePlus 13 claim it will feature a dual-camera array, consisting of a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom. Speculation states the device may switch up its camera design by packing these lenses in a "bar" instead of the familiar circular housing. Rumors add the device could be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite with a flat 6.3-inch OLED display.</p><p>Its launch window is still in limbo as some rumors claim the "first half" of 2025 while others purport the second half.</p>

<ul><li>Users have taken to X and the Samsung forums to report charging issues with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The issues stem from the 45W adapter and 5A cable as users state their devices are either charging slow or not charging at all.</li><li>A Samsung Italia rep confirmed the issue, stating the company is aware and will rectify via a patch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Owners of Samsung's recent Galaxy devices are reporting some strange charging issues.</p><p>Reports cropped up a week ago as users on Samsung's European <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s25-series/s25-charging-problems/td-p/11648030">community forums</a> cited problems with the Galaxy S25 Plus and the S25 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-charging-slow/">SamMobile</a>). The original poster of this forum thread states that their Plus model is encountering issues when charging via Samsung's 45W charger and 5A cable. The user says the products "no longer work" when plugged in for a charging cycle.</p><p>Moreover, the user's Galaxy S25 Plus says it's charging rapidly using Samsung's "Super Charge 2.0" capabilities, but that's not the case. The user adds their device's display frequently displays "the charging status - even though the cable is not moved."</p><p>The user found relief by turning off the fast charging function; however, without it, their Plus charges quite slowly.</p><p>Other users chimed in, with one stating their Galaxy S25 Ultra has the same problem: caught in an endless loop of "charging, not charging... over and over." For this particular case, the user's spouse had no issues with their Ultra and they were forced to receive a new Galaxy S25 Ultra from Verizon — which worked fine.</p><p>Another user stated they purchased a 45W charger for their Ultra and, after two charging cycles, they encountered issues.</p><p>The publication spotted Italian users conversing with Samsung Italia and it seems the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SamsungItalia/status/1887886563733864517">is aware of the problem</a>. The community rep states, "We are aware of an anomaly on charging with the 5A cable that will be resolved with a future update."</p><p>So, it appears that the 45W charger's 5A cable is the culprit, causing some strange disconnect between the phone and the Super Fast Charging function. The X post didn't state <em>when </em>users could see this software fix rollout. While it doesn't seem that widespread, it's still an annoying issue to grapple with.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Samsung pushed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/first-galaxy-s25-series-february-2025-security-patch">its first patch</a> to the Galaxy S25 series late last week. The update was pretty light, only offering a few system-wide improvements and other subtle fixes to improve its stability. Samsung did roll in a trove of security fixes for dozens of flaws and vulnerabilities within its system. This recent patch didn't mention anything about charging issues affecting Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra users, meaning we might have to wait a little longer.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Samsung pushes an emergency patch for this. A more likely case waiting until the March 2025 security patch.</p><p>These issues also create a discouraging overcast as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">a recent test</a> showed that Samsung improved its battery and charging capabilities. The company improved its overall charging speeds, quickening its 0% to 70% charging cycle to 30 minutes and shaving off its 0% to 100% time. Unfortunately, with these issues plaguing several Plus and Ultra models, users are left with more frustrations than enjoyment.</p><p>This isn't the only issue affecting Galaxy S25 Ultra users as a recent report claims the phone's magnetic accessories are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-gets-wonky-with-magnetic-accessories-on">negatively impacting</a> its S Pen functions.</p>

<ul><li>Paramount channels will be available on YouTube TV for the foreseeable future as the two sides reached an agreement.</li><li>The deal comes after the two sides publicly struggled to find what YouTube TV described as "a fair deal."</li><li>The negotiations came shortly after YouTube TV raised prices by $10 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paramount channels were briefly in jeopardy of becoming unavailable on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, but the two sides were able to reach an agreement to keep Paramount's 34 channels on the live TV streaming service. YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> the deal on Feb. 15, following a days-long ordeal that saw Paramount run "Keep Paramount" ads on social media and YouTube TV criticize the company for not offering "a fair deal."</p><p>"We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying Paramount channels, including CBS, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon and more," wrote YouTube TV in the blog post. "To our subscribers, we appreciate your patience while we negotiated on your behalf."</p><p>YouTube TV says the agreement will keep over 100 channels available on the live TV service. It'll also provide Paramount add-ons, like Paramount Plus with SHOWTIME. Paramount offers over 30 channels on YouTube TV, including heavy-hitters like CBS and CBS Sports. High-profile sporting events — including March Madness (the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) and The Masters — are set to air on the networks in the coming months.</p><p>That, paired with YouTube TV's $10 price hike last month, set the service up for a potential disaster if it couldn't reach a deal.</p><p>Things started out dire on Feb. 12, when YouTube TV warned customers that Paramount channels could disappear from the service as early as the end of the following day. It followed up with an update Feb. 13 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-reaches-temporary-deal-to-keep-paramount-channels-including-cbs">YouTube TV reached "a short-term extension" with Paramount</a> while the negotiations continued. In the event it couldn't reach a long-term deal, YouTube TV threw out the idea of offering customers a credit that would allow them to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p>In the end, that wasn't necessary, because the two sides have figured out an agreement. It's not the first time YouTube TV has had issues keeping channels available. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-major-free-channels-outage-issues-confirmed">YouTube TV fixed a problem affecting free channels</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Instagram is reportedly working on a feature that its users may recognize from the old days of YouTube.</p><p>The Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DGD12NZPjwb">posted an explainer</a> about the chance for a "dislike button" to arrive on the platform (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/instagram-starts-testing-dislike-button-comments/">91Mobiles</a>). It seems that Instagram has been running a limited test as Mosseri states some users have already noticed a dislike button beside comments in a post. The post explains that Instagram won't leave much user-facing information by way of a dislike count or notification to others that you've "thumbs downed."</p><p>Instead, Mosseri teases that Instagram's dislike function will be more personal, designed to give "people a private way to signal that they don’t feel good about that particular comment."</p><p>The post teases what <em>could be </em>in store for the future of Instagram's dislike button, like the platform taking into account what you don't like. In short, Mosseri states the platform may "integrate this signal into comments," so things that people have consistently down voted will be pushed toward the bottom.</p><p>Right now, it just appears that Mosseri is bringing awareness to this test as a few users have begun noticing it. Considering the function is pretty barebones (it lacks the signals teased, we might have some waiting to do before it rolls out officially.</p>

<p>There are a couple of platforms that come to mind regarding dislikes: Reddit and YouTube. While the former still has an upvote and downvote feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dislike-and-not-interested-buttons-are-useless">the latter removed it long ago</a>. There was also a study in 2022 that brought attention to YouTube's dislike button and how it (really) didn't help you much. According to Mozilla's research, the dislike option of YouTube could not properly guide bad recommendations out of a user's sight.</p><p>Out of 500 million analyzed videos, the dislike button only succeeded in preventing roughly 12% of unwanted content from appearing.</p><p>What was far more effective was the "remove from watch history" and don't recommend channel" options.</p><p>Additionally, Instagram's interest in hiding away negative or hurtful comments is an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-updates-blocking-nudges-hidden-words">its updated safety features</a>. The platform lets users block one person's account, as well as any other accounts that person may have. That update also brought improvements to Hidden Words, which let users turn on a filter that automatically removed harmful content from their comments and DMs.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon has started suggesting that it is removing the ability to download and back up Kindle books to its PCs.</p><p>The feature widely dubbed “Download & Transfer via USB” will be removed starting February 26 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-closing-kindle-loophole-remove-drm/">Android Police</a>). Amazon has started showing pop-up messages to many Kindle users on the web. Until then, the ability to download books on a PC and transfer them to Kindle devices via USB transfer should work flawlessly for consumers.</p>
<p>Amazon notes that users would still be able to send downloaded Kindle books to their respective devices, provided they have Wi-Fi-enabled ones and by “selecting the ‘Deliver or Remove from Device’ option.”</p><p>The company; however, doesn’t mention why it is removing the feature but as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/kindle-discontinues-download-transfer-via-usb/">How-to Geek</a> points out, it appears it is to lock consumers in the Kindle ecosystem of devices and not allow side loading of books.</p><p>The popular “Download & Transfer via USB” feature is believed to be often used for downloading older purchased books removing their DRM (Digital Rights Management), and converting them to a more universal ePUB format so that they can be imported to other rival book apps similar to Kindle.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of the feature was to import purchased books to Kindle devices that didn’t feature Wi-Fi connectivity and relied on cellular — but that applied to devices released before 2011.</p><p>The new move; however, would likely save from making pirated copies of the books, which seems hassle-free to an extent with the aforementioned functionality. Regardless, it appears to be an encouraging move from Amazon to keep its users glued to its devices’ ecosystem.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With the Samsung Galaxy S25, the company doubled down on AI. The trio of smartphones — the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra — are equipped with a bunch of Google AI and Galaxy AI tools and features. One of them is called AI Drawing Assist, and it's a general term for all the ways Galaxy AI can turn quick doodles into generative AI masterpieces.</p><p>AI Drawing Assist can be used throughout the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and is accessible in a few different ways. If you're curious about how to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung apps and across One UI, this guide covers everything you need to know.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ai-drawing-assist-supported-apps-devices"><span>AI Drawing Assist: Supported apps & devices</span></h3>
<p>AI Drawing Assist is available on the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>, but also older Galaxy phones, including the S24 series, S23 series, S22 series, Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4, Tab S10 series, Tab S9 series, and Tab S8 series. It's not available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10003469/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>. "Ultra" phones that feature an S Pen will have access to more precise drawing or sketching, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra can't use Air Commands like older S Pen-equipped models.</p><p>The official Samsung Notes and Gallery apps have built-in support for AI Drawing Assist. Alternatively, you can use AI Drawing Assist anywhere by calling up AI Smart Select or Drawing Assist from the Edge panel.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-with-smart-select"><span>How to use AI Drawing Assist with Smart Select</span></h3>
<p>The easiest way to use AI Drawing Assist is by opening the Edge panel, which can be done from anywhere in One UI. From there, you can use Smart Select to alter any image on your screen or use Drawing Assist to create one from scratch. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Swipe left on the Edge panel</strong> toward the upper-right part of the screen.</p><p>2. Tap either <strong>AI Select</strong> or <strong>Smart Select</strong>, depending on what is shown on your device.</p><p>3. With AI Select or Smart Select, <strong>tap on something on your screen</strong> to select it.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> or <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> to open the editor. <strong>Draw something</strong> or use <strong>text to describe what you want to change</strong>.</p><p>5. From there, <strong>tap one of the six Drawing Assist styles</strong> and press <strong>Generate</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iT5rC7GEMyR3cViAGste9j" name="Drawing-Assist-Sidebar" alt="Screenshots for using AI Drawing Assist in Samsung apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iT5rC7GEMyR3cViAGste9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6. When you're happy with your image, use the <strong>toolbar</strong> to <strong>copy</strong> the creation to your clipboard, <strong>share it</strong>, or <strong>download it</strong>.</p>
<p>After that, you've made your first Drawing Assist creation. If you don't need to remix an existing image and want to start your own from scratch, you can skip the Smart Select process by pressing <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> directly from the Edge panel.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-with-samsung-gallery"><span>How to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung Gallery</span></h3>
<p>AI Drawing Assist is built into certain Samsung apps, with no need to use the Edge panel. The stock Samsung Gallery app — not Google Photos —  is one of them. Here's how to use Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image in the Gallery app:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gallery app</strong> and <strong>tap a photo</strong> you want to edit.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Photo Assist icon</strong> (it looks like three stars).</p><p>3. Press the <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> button.</p><p>4. Use the <strong>drawing tool</strong> to <strong>sketch what you want to add</strong> to the photo. You can use the <strong>eraser tool</strong> and <strong>undo/redo buttons</strong> to refine the sketch.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Generate</strong> when you're finished sketching.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CBCGsBZPCFjVCBXuGLSHqi" name="Gallery-AI-Drawing-Assist" alt="Screenshots for using AI Drawing Assist in Samsung apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CBCGsBZPCFjVCBXuGLSHqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6.<strong> </strong>Press <strong>Save copy </strong>when finished.</p>
<p>Now, the photo you edited with AI Drawing Assist will be saved to your Gallery.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-with-samsung-notes"><span>How to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung Notes</span></h3>
<p>A similar mechanism for using AI Drawing Assist is available in Samsung Notes. After sketching something in Notes, you can refine it with Sketch to Image and Drawing Assist. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Create a new note</strong> in <strong>Samsung Notes</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Note Assist icon</strong> (it looks like three stars).</p><p>3. Press <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> and <strong>select the drawing</strong> you want to edit.</p><p>4. Pick a <strong>Drawing Assist style</strong> and tap <strong>Generate</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sw9Ceig7CPEyJhHHcSHimi" name="Drawing-Assist-Nots" alt="Screenshots for using AI Drawing Assist in Samsung apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sw9Ceig7CPEyJhHHcSHimi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. After getting your image, you can tap <strong>Generate one more </strong>to get another option.</p><p>6. When you've found one you're happy with, tap <strong>Copy</strong> to add it to your clipboard or <strong>Replace</strong> to swap the AI Drawing Assist image with your original sketch.</p>

<p>If AI Drawing Assist on the Samsung Galaxy S25 sounds a little familiar, it should. We've seen many of these features on past Galaxy phones and tablets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>, but they haven't been tightly integrated like they are on the Galaxy S25. Specifically, this is the first time AI Drawing Assist can handle multiple inputs — like a photo and a sketch, or a photo and a text-to-image prompt.</p><p>This makes AI Drawing Assist on the Galaxy S25 more versatile than ever, and it's a fun way to one-up your notes are images. During my testing of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">base Galaxy S25</a>, I got more than a few great images using Samsung's generative AI.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As much as we love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, most buyers looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new Android phone</a> are probably going to choose between Google or Samsung handsets. They're available through U.S. carriers, are familiar to longtime Android users, and offer best-in-class software. Now that the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 are out, I used both phones side-by-side to figure out which one is best.</p><p>We already have a full breakdown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9">how the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 shake up on paper</a>, so I'm going to focus on the intangibles here. Things like how each phone feels in the hand or what it's like to use Pixel UI or One UI 7 on a daily basis. Boy, are there a lot of them. You might think that as the base-model representatives of the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 series, these two phones have a lot in common, but that just isn't the case.</p><p>The biggest thing you'll notice when picking up either device is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> is lighter, and not by an insignificant margin. It only weighs 162, which makes it the lightest major flagship on the market in the U.S. By comparison, the Pixel 9 weighs 198 grams, and that's more than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Google may have figured out how to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> feel premium this generation, but it hasn't cracked the perfect weight yet.</p><p>The Galaxy S25's weight, plus its compact form factor overall, makes me want to pick it up more than the Pixel 9. It's more comfortable to hold, and I can promise that you'll notice the 36-gram difference without needing to look at the spec sheet. It makes even more of a difference if you like to use your smartphone with a case, because that'll of course add more weight and thickness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UyMEvnEcXG8J7fJjsGFpmc" name="Galaxy-S25-vs-Pixel-9-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 compared to the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UyMEvnEcXG8J7fJjsGFpmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S25 overall, and I'm not sure that's a good thing. The former has a 6.3-inch display, while the latter has a 6.2-inch display. At 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm, the Galaxy S25 is downright tiny, especially when you factor in the rear cameras. They protrude less from the back glass than the Pixel 9's camera bar, so it won't rock as much on a table.</p><p>The displays themselves use similar technology. They're both OLED panels with 120Hz variable refresh rate support and high brightness capabilities. I'd say the Galaxy S25 is slightly less reflective and is easier to view outside, but both are excellent and flat screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aRv9URHyeYbD7pgSwZpzsc" name="Galaxy-S25-vs-Pixel-9-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 compared to the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aRv9URHyeYbD7pgSwZpzsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the Pixel 9 first came out, it was my favorite Android base model yet, and I thought it was capable of going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 16. It would've taken a lot for the Galaxy S25 to top the Pixel 9 in my book, and Samsung did just the right things for that to happen. To be clear, Samsung didn't do everything perfectly. I wanted to see new camera hardware and a fresh design. But it did the <em>right </em>things.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Well, Google has always had a pitch with the Pixel lineup. By going with the Pixel 9, you might not have a phone that wins every benchmark. However, you're going to get a device that is very well-optimized, has fantastic software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">and excels at AI tasks</a>. Here's the thing: the Samsung Galaxy S25 is arguably better optimized, with just-as-good software, and with better AI tasks.</p><p>Samsung and Qualcomm worked together to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset</a>, and it's a breakthrough. Geekbench 6 tests below provide a snapshot of how the Galaxy S25 performs against the Pixel 9 in synthetic workflows. Samsung wins, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4">and it's not particularly close</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, the Galaxy S25 is now the leader in AI processing — a title the Pixel 9 held not too long ago. Google's Tensor G4 processor ran laps around the outgoing Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Galaxy S24, since it could process up to 45 tokens per second. Qualcomm answered with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy mobile platform that can handle 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, besting Google's flagship.</p><p>So, the Galaxy 25 is better at raw performance and AI processing, but what about software? I've been the first to criticize One UI over the years — I've written multiple articles slamming Samsung's tendencies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wants-you-to-move-to-google-messages-and-its-for-the-best">bog phones down with bloat and duplicate apps</a>. However, there is no getting around the fact that One UI 7 is a breakthrough, and it might beat Pixel UI for the first time.</p><p>The reason I quite enjoy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">One UI 7</a> on the Galaxy S25 is that it gives you the best of both Google AI and Galaxy AI. It has great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Circle to Search support and was the first phone to support Gemini's multi-app actions. It also has Magic Editor support via Google Photos. On top of that, it has all of Samsung's magic, including Object Eraser, AI Drawing Assist, and AI Select.</p><p>It's not an exaggeration to say that Samsung is offering the best of both worlds with the Galaxy S25. Meanwhile, Google might have a few Pixel software exclusives, but there's no way to get the expansive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite on a Pixel 9.</p>

<p>Put it all together, and I think the choice between the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 is clear. The former is lighter, more compact, and faster, with more AI and software features.</p><p>Now, before you run to buy a Galaxy S25 for $800, there is a limitation you should know about. It's the camera system, which has been recycled since the Galaxy S22 series and is getting <em>extremely </em>old. As you can see from the photos I've captured with the Galaxy S25 in the gallery below, that leads to results that are just okay.</p>

<p>If you need better cameras, get the Google Pixel 9. That's basically the only reason I'd recommend the Pixel 9 over the Galaxy S25, which is not something I expected to write before testing these phones side-by-side.</p><p>The reality is that Samsung has officially surpassed Google in terms of raw performance, optimization, and AI processing. With many of Google's best AI features coming to the Galaxy S25, there's little reason to favor the Pixel 9 as it currently stands.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This year's crop of flagship Android phones represents something of a victory lap for Qualcomm. Half a decade ago, Apple successfully scaled its A-series phone chips up to the laptop and desktop level. Now, Qualcomm is experiencing a similar leap in reverse. It designed laptop and desktop-class Snapdragon X Elite chips and brought their staple custom Oryon cores to the mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) level with the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.</p><p>As my colleague Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4">recently confirmed in benchmark testing</a>, the Snapdragon 8 Elite crushes what MediaTek and Google comparatively offer. However, Samsung and Qualcomm threw us a curveball when they co-designed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. It's a custom chip based on the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform but tailored to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series of smartphones.</p><p>That begs the question: how much better is the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip than the regular version? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">In their announcement</a>, the two companies touted the custom chip's excellence in image processing, gaming, powering Galaxy AI features, and connectivity. Is that enough to make you think twice about buying a flagship with a standard Snapdragon 8 Elite chip?</p><p>To find out, the team at Android Central tested a slew of Snapdragon 8 Elite–powered devices against the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra. For our Snapdragon 8 Elite lineup, we tested the Honor Magic 7 Pro, iQOO 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. We then stacked that up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">benchmark scores of the Galaxy S25 Ultra from Andrew Myrick's review</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25's scores from my review</a>.</p><p>To say that the results were surprising would be an understatement. While the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip is plenty powerful, it rarely beats other top Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p>

<p>We know a bit about the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. For starters, it's overclocked slightly higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">base Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> — the SoC can hit  4.47 GHz compared to 4.32 GHz. However, Qualcomm and Samsung haven't shared much else about the chip's under-the-hood tweaks.</p><p>After running our full slate of benchmark tests, including PCMark, 3DMark, Geekbench 6, and Geekbench AI, it's clear that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy does not win often against Snapdragon 8 Elite–powered devices. Three out of four of Snapdragon 8 Elite phones — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-basically-a-power-bank-attached-to-a-gaming-phone">RedMagic 10 Pro</a>, and ROG Phone 9 Pro — posted higher PCMark overall scores than both Galaxy S25 devices. The latter two phones crushed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy devices by a margin of nearly 5,000 points.</p><p>That general theme is consistent throughout our slate of benchmarks and stress testing. Aside from the iQOO 13, the other three Snapdragon 8 Elite phones edge out the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy–powered models almost every time. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, a $1,299 Samsung flagship, didn't come in first place in a single test. For some reason, the base Galaxy S25 performed better, but it still didn't stack up against the best Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p><p>The takeaway here shouldn't be that the Galaxy S25 is better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, or that the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro is better than the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Instead, these benchmarking results signal that how a manufacturer chooses to run its processor of choice matters much more than whether it's the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip or the "for Galaxy" variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hao5HUPw4unfvJeVszQPih" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-S25-Plus-back-holding-02" alt="Comparing the backs of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hao5HUPw4unfvJeVszQPih.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no better proof of this than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, which has the same chip as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> but performs nearly 10,000 points lower in certain benchmark tests. The problem here isn't Snapdragon 8 Elite, it's that iQOO is artificially limiting the chip's performance. There could be a number of reasons for that, including battery life, TDP, or thermal throttling concerns.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung is doing something similar with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor in the Galaxy S25 series. It may be overclocked and customized for Galaxy phones, but the results speak for themselves: this chip isn't reaching its full potential. It's impossible to know why Samsung went this route for sure, though we noticed slight performance dips due to thermal throttling during graphics stress tests on both the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Really, these results prove that you don't need to pick a smartphone for its processor in 2025. Benchmarks aside, all the phones tested are capable devices that have performed excellently in daily use. Even devices not listed here, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>, are more than capable.</p><p>While it's clear that Samsung is doing impressive things with on-device AI and the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform, it's not materially better than all the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p>

<p>EssilorLuxottica, the main partner behind Meta’s smart glasses, has revealed how well the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> are doing. Turns out, since launching in October 2023, they’ve already sold over 2 million pairs.</p><p>The latest revelation comes hot on the heels of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement a few weeks back, where he shared that the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses hit one million sales in 2024.</p><p>The smart glasses have been such a hit that EssilorLuxottica is ramping up production in a big way. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/ray-ban-meta-glasses-sold-2-units-production-to-be-vastly-increased/" target="_blank">UploadVR</a>, the manufacturer is aiming to churn out a whopping 10 million units a year by the end of 2026.</p><p>Meta is going all out to push its smart glasses, even dropping big-budget Super Bowl ads starring A-list celebrities. This heavy-hitting promotion shows just how serious it is about keeping sales on the rise for the rest of the year.</p><p>During EssilorLuxottica’s FY2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/investors/financial-publications/" target="_blank">earnings call</a>, CEO and Chairman Francesco Milleri predicted that glasses are set to become the go-to digital platform for tackling our everyday needs. So, it sounds like the company is betting big on smart eyewear becoming a must-have tech staple.</p><p>Milleri made it clear that EssilorLuxottica is in it for the long haul with Meta, seeing the Ray-Ban Meta platform as more than just their own thing. He described it as a “shared platform” that’s open for collaboration with other brands.</p><p>Rumor has it Meta is already working on the next version of its smart glasses, and this time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-ray-ban-meta-ar-glasses-are-getting-a-visual-upgrade">they might include a tiny display</a>.</p><p>Right now, Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses work with no display, leaning on touch and voice controls. But rumor has it that Meta is toying with the idea of adding a screen in future models. That could open up new possibilities, like visual cues and extra features, making the glasses even more versatile.</p><p>Milleri hinted that all of Meta’s smart glasses will be powered by AI, teased the possibility of subscription services, and shared EssilorLuxottica’s excitement for Meta’s multimodal AI tech to roll out globally.</p>

The bigger panel meant I was able to get a decent amount of work done on the iPad Pro by connecting a mechanical keyboard. <br><br>As much as I like the iPad Pro M2, I wanted an iPad with an OLED panel, so I was immediately excited for the iPad Pro M4. The tablet is available in 11 and 13-inch variants, and I knew I needed the bigger screen, so that's the one I went with. After six months of extensive use involving plenty of writing with the Magic Keyboard and a dozen or so external keyboards, playing over a hundred hours of games (mostly Balatro), reading ebooks, doodling in Procreate, and messing around with synths, I'm ready to say it — this is the best iPad I've ever used. <br><br>That was never in doubt anyway, but the changes to the design and the OLED panel make the latest iPad Pro a rather enticing upgrade, and if you're using an older tablet or are mulling a switch, here's what you need to know about this M4-powered beast.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled the iPad Pro M4 on May 7, 2024, and the tablet is now available globally. It is sold in a 11-inch model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7FC1P/ref=sr_1_2?crid=S8H3AAHGLATF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CI6OrrdQaMgkBhgDIo4G3LA-OJLslwe7VIIy7QKiS02ZcQZxXf-NhZRpcdcCYJiPopyMsfntaXDpRZRjV8xmuXsXjgVq6npRNN3m-T_YgdkDH1VBKkoc8yM4VUyGW8PETM_xZkTkXH766KQEiVl_iW-pp-JWXJdS3AqrGjo6XUqY9AimbWaW0YQZ5a6JnUgUNPK3HYHYYZPiSLfawgGZ1gnbwZMPoKUSXqNEcMSZkn8.vsiJ3_X7hpw6TFHNHtLKvDooPbNEr572xkvqse2SlaQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=iPad%2BPro%2BM4&qid=1739157688&sprefix=ipad%2Bpro%2B13%2Bm4%2B%2Caps%2C477&sr=8-2&th=1">that starts at $999</a> for the base 256GB configuration, going up to $1,199 for the 512GB edition, $1,599 for the 1TB variant, and $1,999 if you need 2TB of storage. These are the standard Wi-Fi-only models; if you need cellular connectivity, you'll need to shell out an additional $200. <br><br>The 13-inch iPad Pro M4 debuted at $1,299 for the 256GB variant, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7FC1P">now available for $1,099 at Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/6533540.p?skuId=6533540">Best Buy</a>. The 512GB model costs $1,499, the 1TB variant is $1,899, and the 2TB option costs $2,299. If you're interested in the 1TB or 2TB models, you can get a glare-resistant nano-textured panel that's aimed at color-sensitive work, with this option costing an additional $100. Like the 11-inch model, you'll need to pay $200 more if you want cellular connectivity. <br><br>I'm using the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 in Space Black — it's also available in Silver — and I have the 1TB model with standard glass and cellular connectivity. I also got the new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, and the total cost of the tablet and accessories is a heady $2,577.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-design"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2prjzMCwhNv7KjUoLuTRC6" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2prjzMCwhNv7KjUoLuTRC6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is a key talking about with the iPad Pro M4, and the sleek chassis absolutely makes a difference. The iPad Pro is noticeably thinner and lighter than previous years, and the 13-inch model in particular is incredible. Coming in at just 5.1mm, it is the thinnest Apple product I used yet, and it feels fantastic to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="65Q2LKnrgkoHKhawzRNvh5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/65Q2LKnrgkoHKhawzRNvh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Weight is also a big consideration, and coming in at 579g, the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 is a full 103g lighter than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2, and that's a huge deal. The thinner chassis and significantly lighter weight makes the iPad Pro M4 that much easier to handle, and even though this is an oversized tablet, you just don't get that sense in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vvYzaT5ZJgmQE6NibnNxh5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvYzaT5ZJgmQE6NibnNxh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I use most phones without a case, the sheer size of the iPad means you'll need to invest in a folio case at the least to give the tablet added protection. The chassis is made out of recycled aluminum, and while I didn't test its durability, there's no flex whatsoever, and there are no problems with build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="us7tNEeFSQSZu6uo6S2ds5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/us7tNEeFSQSZu6uo6S2ds5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The overall aesthetic itself is unchanged from previous years; the dull grey design language doesn't stand out too much, and you get antennae lines at the top and bottom. The USB-C port is located at the bottom, and you get four speakers that get loud. The power button is up top, and like its predecessor, Face ID is the standard way to unlock the tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H357xkheEEvw2N97nKrJg5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H357xkheEEvw2N97nKrJg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, Apple finally moved the position of the front camera, and it's now located on the leading edge. You no longer have to awkwardly position the tablet to center your frame in meetings, and while it's a small change, it's long overdue. The 12MP front camera uses Center Stage to position you in the center even if you're moving around, and the video quality is decent enough — I attended dozens of briefings and made hundreds of FaceTime calls using the iPad Pro, and didn't see any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cFZP97AQJdyydQcVCz3Qg5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFZP97AQJdyydQcVCz3Qg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the global <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a> still has a physical SIM card slot, Apple is going all-in on eSIM with the iPad Pro M4, and if you opt for the cellular model, you only get eSIM instead of a nano-SIM slot like the iPad Pro M2. This isn't a big deal as it's easy to set up eSIM on the iPad Pro, but I would have preferred the convenience of a traditional SIM tray. <br><br>Other than that minor quibble, I've had zero issues with the design or build quality of the iPad Pro M4. After my work monitor and the Kindle Oasis, the iPad Pro M4 got the most amount of usage in the last six months, and it held up incredibly well.</p>

<p>The defining feature on the iPad Pro M4 is the 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED panel. It has ProMotion tech and goes up to 120Hz, has a wide color gamut, and the True Tone engine. The resolution is increased to 2752 x 2064 to get to the 13-inch size up from 12.9 inches, but the pixel density is the same at 264ppi.</p>
<p>What's interesting about the panel is that the iPad Pro M4 uses tandem OLED tech, where two OLED panels are combined to deliver greater brightness. This addresses one of the biggest issues with OLEDs — high brightness levels — and Apple said it used tandem OLEDs to ensure the tablet gets adequately bright. If anything, the iPad Pro M4 manages to outshine its predecessor. It is able to go up to 1000 nits in regular use, hitting 1600 nits in HDR content.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues with brightness levels whatsoever, and having used the tablet outdoors extensively, there was never a scenario where the screen didn't get bright enough — even under harsh sunlight. The standard glass panel has an anti-reflective coating, and it does a decent job in its own right; that said, the nano-textured coating is the way to go if you're going to predominantly use the iPad outdoors.</p>
<p>The switch to OLED delivers much better colors, and the iPad Pro M4 has been an absolute delight to use for reading, gaming, streaming content, and making music. The fact that you now get true blacks and excellent color vibrancy means the iPad Pro M4 has a distinct edge, and HDR content in particular comes alive on the 13-inch panel.</p>

<p>There's a noticeable difference in color fidelity over the mini-LED iPad Pro M2, and the quality of the panel itself is worth the upgrade if you're on an older iPad. Basically, this isn't the best panel on any iPad, but one of the best OLED displays I've ever used, and Apple nailed the technicalities. I used phones with tandem OLED tech as well — notably the Honor Magic 6 RSR — but the difference isn't as evident on a smaller device.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro M4 has the best hardware package of any tablet today. The outgoing iPad Pro M2 was already a powerhouse in this regard, and the switch to M4 silicon makes things that much more interesting. You get decent efficiency gains as well with the move to a 3nm manufacturing node. <br><br>The M4 variant you get changes with the storage configuration. The 1TB and 2TB models come with a 10-core CPU that includes four performance cores and six efficiency cores, and they have a 10-core GPU, hardware-accelerated ray tracing engine, 160core neural engine, and a memory bandwidth of 120GB/s. These models also get 16GB of RAM as standard, so if you're unsure about which option to get, I'd suggest picking up the 1TB variant.</p>
<p>By contrast, the 256GB and 512GB models get a 9-core CPU that features three performance cores instead. The memory is halved at 8GB, but other than that, the rest of the hardware is identical. There's ProRes and AV1 decode, Wi‑Fi 6E with Bluetooth 5.3, Sub-6 5G on the cellular model, and Thunderbolt 3 as well as USB 4 connectivity over USB-C. You get the standard magnetic pins at the back that let you dock the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and associated accessories.</p>

<p>In short, this is the most powerful iPad around. It blazes through console-quality games and demanding video-editing tasks without a sweat, and in the six months I had it, I didn't feel like the full potential of the M4 was being utilized. There isn't any utility that challenges the hardware as such, and frankly, the M4 is overkill for mundane tasks.</p><p>I don't use the iPad to take photos, so I can't reasonably talk about the 12MP camera in any great detail. That said, the few shots I managed came out decent enough. Most of my usage was with the front camera, and it is a little better than the one on the iPad Pro M2.</p><p>There isn't anything amiss on the battery front either; the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 has a 10300mAh battery, and it lasts a smidgen longer than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2 even though the battery size is smaller. I easily get a day's worth of use when using the iPad exclusively to write, browse the web, and play games, and battery anxiety just isn't a thing with the tablet. <br><br>It takes nearly two and a half hours to charge the iPad Pro M4, with the tablet maxing out at 30W. It's not a huge drawback as you get great battery life in general, but fast charging isn't anywhere as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> and tablets.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-magic-keyboard"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Magic Keyboard</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2vRkEG7zSGeFbFgLC8CW26" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vRkEG7zSGeFbFgLC8CW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Magic Keyboard costs $349, which is as much as the iPad 10th generation. Obviously, cost plays a big part in your purchasing decision, and if you want to maximize value, you'll need to pick up an aftermarket option. That said, I like this iteration of the Magic Keyboard quite a bit. The hinge is sturdier, and it doesn't have any wobble when using the keyboard on a table. <br><br>The aluminum frame gives it much better rigidity, and the new trackpad is fantastic to use. Also, the fact that you get a function row is a big deal, and it makes a difference in daily use. The keys have decent 1mm travel, and the scissor-style design is identical to what you get on a MacBook. You get good backlight, and there's enough spacing that it doesn't actually feel like you're using a mobile keyboard. <br><br>Just like the iPad Pro M4, the Magic Keyboard is thinner and lighter, and it doesn't add too much bulk to the device. The best part continues to be the cantilever mechanism, and the easy adjustability makes it a great choice.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-apple-pencil-pro"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Apple Pencil Pro </span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m49CyWURVWTYgkpEid6Wj5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m49CyWURVWTYgkpEid6Wj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Apple Pencil Pro is my favorite iPad Pro m4 accessory. I've always been a fan of the Pencil, and the Pencil Pro includes a haptic engine that delivers excellent feedback when using the stylus. There's a new squeeze gesture that pulls up utilities as needed — it surfaces a palette if you're drawing — and a double tap gesture allows you to easily switch between tools. <br><br>There's even a barrel roll feature that makes a big difference when jotting notes, and I ended up using the iPad Pro M4 to take notes mostly because of this addition.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-software"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XnkoNb2js8q87zzDi9xYD6" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XnkoNb2js8q87zzDi9xYD6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 runs iPadOS 18.3, and while you don't get much in the way of new features, there are better privacy controls and increased customizability. I don't usually take notes on my iPad — I have a physical journal — but the updates to handwritten notes and highlighting along with the ability to transcribe audio within Notes makes it easier than ever to use the iPad as a note-taking device.</p>
<p>What I particularly like is that the Calculator now automatically solves equations — just write out the expressions and add an equals sign. I didn't have anything as convenient growing up, and it's just a cool addition. Just like iOS 18, you have the ability to style app icons, and arrange widgets and apps however you want on the home screen, and it makes a bigger difference on the iPad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LZoSr5v85o8LNGTSDTQon5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZoSr5v85o8LNGTSDTQon5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Control Center has dedicated pages now to control music playback and smart home devices, and it's inherently customizable. Of course, the biggest addition is Apple Intelligence; the inclusion of image generation and writing tools give the iPad Pro M4 an advantage, and while I'm not keen on generative AI, it works pretty well on the iPad.</p>
<p>The reason I continue using iPads daily is the vast software ecosystem; whether it's video and image utilities like Procreate and LumaFusion, music production apps like Korg Gadget 3, SynthMaster, and Drambo, or high-quality games, the selection is significantly better than Android. I dabble in music production, and the iPad Pro M4 is now my go-to choice when trying out a new synth or drum machine. It's just so much more convenient than using my Windows machine, and the fact that you get the same utilities on what is essentially a mobile platform is incredible.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-the-alternatives"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: The alternatives</span></h3>

<p>The iPad Pro M4 doesn't have any alternatives as such; the sleeker design and OLED panel give it a definite edge over the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2. That said, if you don't need the new additions, the iPad Pro M2 is still a great choice — if you can get it on sale. While Samsung also makes Android tablets with OLED panels, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't anywhere as good. <br><br>Ultimately, the best choice is the 11-inch iPad Pro M4. It has the same great tandem OLED and similar design, and while it isn't as thin, it is thinner and lighter than previous generations. The software is identical, and you get great battery life. If portability is a key consideration, I'd recommend the 11-inch model instead of the 13-inch iPad Pro M4.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Should you buy it?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an iPad with an OLED panel</li><li>You need a tablet with the best hardware</li><li>You want excellent battery life</li><li>You need robust software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an affordable iPad</li><li>You want a MacBook rival</li></ul>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 delivers everything I need in a tablet. The 13-inch tandem OLED is one of the best displays of any device I've used, and it is magnificent in daily use — whether it's streaming content, reading text, or gaming. The ultra-thin design is a big differentiator as well, and the iPad Pro M2 feels big and unwieldy next to the M4 model. <br><br>There are absolutely no issues when it comes to the hardware, and the vast accessory ecosystem means you can get a reliable keyboard case and stylus if you don't want to get the Magic Keyboard and Pencil Pro. Battery life is pretty great too, and the front camera is much better this time around. <br><br>It's the software that makes me come back to the iPad Pro M4. Yes, iPadOS isn't as versatile as macOS, and multitasking is still a challenge — that doesn't bother me in the least. I predominantly use the iPad Pro M4 to focus on one thing at a time — whether it's writing in Evernote, learning Procreate, reading a book, or trying out a new synth — and the software is well-suited for that use case. <br><br>Ultimately, choosing the iPad Pro M4 comes down to money; it is one of the costliest options in this category, but you get a lot of tablet for the cash. If you need the absolute best that Apple has to offer, the iPad Pro M4 is a wholehearted recommendation. But if you need something that's more affordable, there's no shortage of options.</p>

As a result, the company decided to hit pause on the service for a while to sort things out.</p><p>The tech giant has temporarily shut down its Android earthquake alerts in Brazil after a glitch caused a false alarm in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/sudeste/sp/google-pede-desculpas-e-diz-que-investiga-falso-alerta-de-terremoto/" target="_blank">CNN Brasil</a> reported (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-android-earthquake-alerts-false-alarm-brazil/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Early Friday morning, around 2 AM, folks were jolted awake by warnings of a 5.5 magnitude quake that never happened, with the system mistakenly pointing to Ubatuba and Baixada Santista as the epicenters.</p><p>São Paulo’s Civil Defense confirmed there was no seismic activity and clarified they didn’t send out any alerts, making it clear the Android warnings were a total mix-up.</p><p>Google owned up to the blunder, stating that the system got confused by some offshore activity near São Paulo, which led to the bogus alerts. It has since apologized for the false alarm.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-rolls-out-global-earthquake-detection-network-powered-android-phones">Android Earthquake Alerts System</a>, launched in the U.S. in 2020, works by tapping into data from tons of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Using their built-in motion sensors, these devices can pick up on the first, weaker tremors (called P-waves) that hit before the stronger shaking (S-waves) kicks in. The idea is to give people a heads-up—just a few extra seconds—before the real shaking starts.</p><p>Essentially, Google’s earthquake alerts system turns smartphones into mini seismometers. Since launching more than four years ago, it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-earthquake-alerts-system-expands-greece-new-zealand">expanded to places like Greece and New Zealand</a>.</p><p>This is the system’s first major false alarm since launch. While it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66316462" target="_blank">reportedly missed alerts</a> during the 2023 Turkey earthquake, Google insists it worked as expected.</p><p>Google hasn’t revealed the exact cause yet, but it has shut down the alert system across Brazil while investigating the incident.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google TV’s Freeplay has pulled the plug on three free channels, including a couple of holiday-themed ones.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-tv-removes-adds-more-free-channels/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Freeplay just axed three holiday-themed Xumo channels: the Holiday Movie Channel, Holiday Classics, and Christian Christmas.</p><p>Meanwhile, OutTV Proud and Shades of Black are back after being pulled earlier this month. That said, the other channels that got the axe are still missing for now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> Freeplay’s latest channel shuffle comes just a few months after it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tv-sneaks-in-dozens-of-new-free-channels-for-you-to-skip-over">beefed up its lineup to over 170 free streams</a>, thanks in part to some holiday-themed picks.</p><p>Even after its big expansion, Google TV Freeplay has been shedding some free channels. According to 9to5, The Hill TV, Dog Whisperer with Cesar Milan, Dove Channel, Comedy Dynamics, and The Bob Ross Channel got the boot, though the channels added in the previous update managed to dodge the cuts.</p><p>It’s annoying when your go-to channels just vanish out of nowhere. Google TV Freeplay’s constant channel shuffle—adding some, dropping others—makes it tough to count on for steady viewing.</p><p>And, of course, Google isn’t exactly upfront about these changes, so it feels like a bit of a mystery. Your best move is to check its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/11167990#zippy=%2Cavailable-channels" target="_blank">support page</a> for the latest lineup, though even that might not always be current.</p><p>As you may already know, Google TV users have access to a huge selection of channels, including plenty that won’t cost a dime. If you’re in the U.S., Freeplay is a standout perk because it hooks you up with free live TV via its own app.</p><p>That said, not every channel sticks around forever since Google is always tweaking the lineup. This time, Google TV Freeplay axed three channels, but it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>

They may have some FDA-approved sensors, but there's always fine print saying to take worrying readings with a grain of salt. But smartwatch and smart ring makers are aiming for medical-grade accuracy at all costs (literally). Not necessarily for <em>your</em> peace of mind, but because there's profit to be had if the healthcare industry buys in.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-kicks-off-battery-arms-race-for-smartwatches">OnePlus Watch 3</a> dominated headlines last week because of its 5-day battery, so you probably missed the news about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-new-health-lab-is-a-big-step-for-its-wellness-technology">OnePlus opening a €13.5 million 4,840m² Health Lab</a> in Guangdong, China. Run by "medical professionals and multidisciplinary software and hardware engineers," it's designed for "long-term research collaborations" with over 30 medical companies and research institutions to study athletes' physiological data.</p><p>As a side benefit, OnePlus will use lab sensors to "improve the ability of self-developed algorithms, allowing smartwatches to better monitor exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary health."</p><p>That may all sound a bit intense, but it's no surprise. Dive into the career pages for Apple and Google, and you'll find open jobs related to clinical studies, health sensor development, data center construction, health privacy, biophotonics — the list truly goes on and on. Cardiologists and smartwatch engineers have intertwined career paths in Big Tech.</p><p>Some of this research goes into new health data points; Apple is reportedly closing in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-ultra-3-and-apple-watch-11-rumored-to-finally-get-long-awaited-health-tracking-feature">blood pressure tracking</a>, while a Samsung exec hinted last month that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">non-invasive blood glucose monitoring</a> is coming soon. Pulling that off takes serious R&D.</p><p>Other research focuses on better HR algorithms for athletes, like Google claiming the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running yet" to try and pull customers away from fitness brands like Garmin and Polar. This watch was also the first with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">"Loss of Pulse" feature</a>.</p><p>But to be frank, courting athletes or consumers with health issues won't justify this investment. Google didn't buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion just to make its future Pixel Watches more accurate, and OnePlus's new sports lab isn't really about the casual athletes that wear its watches.</p><p>I believe a business-to-business (B2B) battle is coming for smartwatches (and smart rings) that are all trying to be the clinical, portable option for other industries. They're all racing to collect your data and use it to self-improve their results until they can aim their sights higher. And you getting heart health warnings or daily workout recommendations is only a side effect.</p>

<p>The other smartwatch health news that prompted this column was Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/new-holistic-apple-health-study-launches-today-in-the-research-app/?1739368761">announcing</a> its latest Health Study on how to use technology to "predict, detect, monitor, and manage changes in participants’ health," across "a number of health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more."</p><p>This ambitious, holistic study isn't being handled in a creepy way: It's an opt-in program with options on what you share with researchers, and Apple itself doesn't get identifying information.</p><p>What it will get is the overall results, from potentially millions of customers, showing which data its watches successfully track and which areas it fails at, adding context that it can't normally find out on its own.</p><p>That kind of data can be incredibly valuable for preventative care, if it can analyze your health and workout trends and warn you of potential changes to your physiology or mental capacity. That <em>could</em> help you, but it'll certainly help Apple keep you in its device ecosystem if it keeps marketing its Watches as life-saving.</p>

<p>Everyone is intrigued by blood pressure and glucose, but we're seeing right now how smartwatches are analyzing your AGEs Index, arterial stiffness, and other niche bodily health information that's tied to long-term health warning signs. I don't think any <em>consumers</em> were asking for this; I think it's a proof of concept for doctors to prove how useful these devices can be if they join forces.</p><p>Imagine if Apple partnered with your healthcare provider and could key in its watches to look out for <em>specific</em> biomarkers related to your condition or genetics. Some smartwatches can already collect data to send to your doctor, but perhaps these apps could automatically send reports, either at regular intervals or whenever there's a sustained issue with a given metric.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">Smart ring</a> sales are so niche that they're barely worth mentioning compared to smartwatches. But I think it's relevant that so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/we-saw-three-potential-futures-for-smart-rings-at-ces">smart ring brands at CES</a> pushed their medical-grade accuracy and brought up unprompted the idea of B2B sales to medical companies.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a> ditched the company's trademark haptic engine for an FDA-approved ECG; in the CEO's words, they're transitioning from wellness to an alternative for "expensive" and "invasive" medical checks. The Evie Ring got FDA approval for blood oxygen readings, and its CEO also labeled it as a "clinical-grade device for B2B channels." Ultrahuman wants you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision">send them blood</a> so they can compare your smart ring data against your biomarkers, and Oura has its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-symptom-radar-early-stress-signs-announced">Symptom Radar</a> to link your biometrics with possible causes.</p><p>These new companies want to leapfrog wellness straight into the health industry for a reason. Either they think it's a market ready to be tapped, or they think "wellness" alone will be seen as less marketable or profitable very soon. Whether smart rings are <em>successful</em> against Big Tech brands with more resources to throw into this gambit, they're shooting their shot.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-good-or-a-bad-trend-yes-2">Is this a good or a bad trend? Yes.</h2>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, or smart rings becoming so accurate that they can be relied upon for clinical trials. You can be skeptical that they're as accurate as these companies <em>want</em> them to be, but I won't censure them for striving for something potentially unattainable instead of coasting on "wellness" estimates.</p><p>What I worry about — and I've written about this before — is that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-challenge-of-using-smartwatches-and-smart-rings">genuinely tough to be confronted by bad smartwatch readings</a> on a daily basis.</p><p>Anyone would want their watch to catch signs of a heart attack so you can call your doctor. But if they start tracking your body's poor health markers that signal potential issues years or decades down the line, will that help you turn your life around, or just send you spiraling into stress and fatalism?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc" name="sleep-apnea-warning-apple-watch-series-10.jpeg" alt="Sleep Apnea warning on Apple Watch Series 10 and iPhone 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2164" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know someone who spotted a potential kidney issue because their smart scale told them they were constantly dehydrated no matter how much water they drank. This was vital information to know, but in the aftermath, the smart scale app continued to warn them. They started checking this data more often, hoping lifestyle changes would immediately fix the problem; when nothing helped, they felt hopeless.</p><p>Of course I want to know if I have arterial stiffness or high blood sugar, but once I <em>do</em> know, I'll continue to be confronted by this information. Smartwatches have all these gamefied tools like daily rings meant to encourage you to become healthier, but some health issues can't be solved by a gung-ho attitude.</p>
<hr>
<p>I won't be surprised if, within the next five to ten years, we start seeing more doctors prescribing smartwatches and smart rings for at-home monitoring as an affordable alternative to expensive equipment, with these brands offering a spinoff healthcare app that highlights specific information shared with you and your doctor.</p><p>The current AI revolution will play into this, of course. Medical journals are already being fed into specialized AIs; the next step is for your actual health data and testing results to power future insights. Apple's research study and OnePlus's specialized lab will only become increasingly common, feeding AI data that (again) these companies can sell to healthcare providers.</p><p>The side effect of this is simple: You're going to get bombarded with more and more health and wellness information the moment you put on your smartwatch. And some people will be overwhelmed by it.</p><p>You can mentally prepare yourself for bad news before visiting a doctor; it's harder to do the moment you wake up and see a health warning in your smartwatch's Morning Report.</p>

<h2 id="here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-battery-life-2">Here's what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life</h2>
<p>After months of anticipation and wait, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's Galaxy S25 line-up</a> is finally here. As has been the case for the last few years, the family is comprised of three cutting-edge flagship smartphones. The base model—the Galaxy S25—packs everything from top-of-the-line hardware to an incredible triple-lens primary camera setup, all while being compact enough for one-handed use.</p><p>If you were to compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S24</a>, you'd see that the new model doesn't look all that different from its predecessor. Yes, you do get the latest in terms of hardware, lots of AI-powered tools, years of software updates, and more. But even though the phone is a little lighter than the previous-gen model, it still manages to pack in a 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The same goes for the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which both have the same battery capacity as their predecessors. While that's good, the question is, what kind of battery life can be expected from the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung says that "the Galaxy S25's battery usage time is enhanced for you to enjoy watching hours of videos, all thanks to a custom-made AP (Application Processor) and software optimization." While this claim doesn't really tell us that much, we have good news. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Android Central's Brady Snyder found the compact flagship to be more than capable of going on all day, that too with mixed-use involving everything from video streaming to taking calls. Unless you're a very heavy user, you can expect up to six hours of screen-on time and up to ten hours of screen-off time.</p><p>This is in line with the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, which can last roughly a full day on a single charge with anywhere between six to eight hours of screen-on time in our use.</p><p>We know that the Galaxy S25 series is driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, a custom version of Qualcomm's newest flagship chipset. Among other improvements, the SoC helps with the device's overall energy efficiency. In addition, the inclusion of a larger vapor chamber should also allow for better-sustained performance (especially while gaming) without having an impact on battery life.</p><p>There's no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is very much going to end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there, even more so for those who like pocketable devices. It has a premium design, blazing-fast performance, and more AI-based tricks than you can shake a stick it. Combine that with years of software support and solid battery life, and you get a top-tier Android phone that you shouldn't ignore.</p>

In a community blog post on their foldable strategy, Vale G, a OnePlus product manager, said the company is 'recalibrating their foldable strategy' and confirmed that it will be holding off on launching a OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year," the community post explained.</p><p>Since OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, the two share combined hardware and research teams, as well as a common software codebase. It looks like the focus is now fully on launching the world's thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">OPPO Find N5</a>, in the next couple of weeks. That said, OpenPlus doesn't fully rule out the possibility of launching Open 2 in the future.</p><p>"While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category," the community post added.</p>

<p>While the OnePlus Open 2 won't make an appearance this year, the company's next wearable will still launch as scheduled. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-detailed-ahead-of-launch" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first full look of its OnePlus Watch 3, which will launch on February 18 in the US, Canada, and European markets.</p><p>In a detailed press release, the OnePlus claims that this new watch is set to blend in with the user's daily needs with a "classic, premium, and durable design."  That said, the company is going full throttle on its "Never Settle" mantra by offering the Watch 3 with a whopping 16-day battery life on power saver mode and a prolonged 120 hours of battery on Smart mode. This is a bump from the 100-hour limit on its predecessor.</p>

The update came with some much-needed media, camera, and graphics features. The Beta 2 comes with something called the 'hybrid auto-exposure mode,' which allows users manual and auto-exposure options while capturing images.</p><p>Right now, users can choose either one of the above and not a combination of the two settings. With Android 16 Beta 2, they can control ISO or exposure time and use auto-exposure algorithms simultaneously.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16"> Beta 2</a> also brings actions for motion photos, a combination of still images and short videos with audio so that developers can decide where the motion photo will be saved.</p><p>Google remains on track to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">meet its new Android release schedule</a>, meaning Android 16 will be released to the public in the second quarter of 2025.</p>

The original poster displayed the "limitless" possibilities of the refreshed module in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which showcased apps and folder placement. Pinching inward on their display brought up the usual home screen editing options but with a newly added "DIY Home" button.</p><p>What's more, is that tapping on the icon gives users complete freedom over the size and orientation of an app widget or folder. With this, you could basically place any app icon anywhere you'd like on the home screen without following the rules of the usual grid. The user is also able to overlap widgets and apps for a truly chaotic home screen. The demo only shows these changes applying to the apps above the bottom toolbar like messaging, phone calls, contacts, or anything else. Additionally, tapping a folder that's been rotated or upside down will open apps in it as normal.</p><p>People enrolled in the beta program can give these customizations a go. However, the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">reportedly pushing back the stable rollout</a> of this OS on the Galaxy S24 due to a display coloring issue. Samsung stated that One UI 7 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">preparing to hit</a> older Galaxy S devices "imminently" in Q1 2025.</p>

According to Mark Gurman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, TikTok was first spotted on the Apple App Store. Several other users took to X, stating that the app had on Feb. 12. It looks like the app was being made available in phases and rolled out to most users today Feb.14.</p><p>Additionally, the publication reports that the app has reappeared on the Google Play Store. Android Central has also spotted TikTok's availability via the Play Store, so users who may have deleted the app or never had it can now download it.</p><p>While this may be good news for several avid TikTok-ers, Bloomberg states it has 75 days (from Jan 20) to find common ground with the U.S. government over privacy/security concerns. This looks like an interim solution while the company buys time to settle things with the present authorities.</p>
<h2 id="spotify-bug-messed-with-premium-subscribers-2">Spotify bug messed with Premium subscribers</h2>

<p>Spotify premium subscribers had a frustrating experience this week. Despite paying $12 per month for an ad-free service, they ended up hearing commercial ads that disrupted their podcast or music. There were multiple reports of this issue on Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">community forums</a>, dating back to last Friday, Feb. 7. People were reporting issues and reaching out to support in multiple ways, with one user saying that it has been "impossible to talk to anyone at Spotify."</p><p>Only a week later, Spotify seemed to look into the issue. Spotify said, "Our tech teams are currently investigating reports of Premium users hearing ads. We'll keep you posted here if we have any news to share, so make sure to Subscribe to the thread to stay tuned."</p><p>Initially, the company asked users affected to add to the thread their device information, app version or web player, the type of ad they heard, and any troubleshooting steps they've already taken.</p><p>However, a few hours later, Spotify posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">update</a> on its community forum confirming that the issue was the result of a bug and has since been fixed. "We have good news from our teams a fix for the instances where Premium users noticed ads when listening to music has been deployed and you should notice a difference right away," the company said. "It's worth keeping in mind, however, that it is expected that both free & Premium users may still see ads when listening to podcasts."</p>

While I used to be very vocal about how Motorola just wasn't doing a good job making its low-end phones remotely useable, the company has come a long way in recent years, proving that users can still have a good experience without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">spending $1,300 for a phone</a>. And things are only going to get better for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>.</p><p>Last year, my top Android phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which retailed for $999, and it's still my daily driver because I absolutely love the form factor. However, right before I got my hands on it, I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, a phone that I was pretty sure I would forget almost as soon as I stopped using it. Instead, I didn't wanna put the phone down, even when I had to switch gears to the Razr.</p><p>The Stylus just felt like a flagship in a phone that cost half as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> would cost you today and with pretty comparable specs. It has a Full HD+ OLED display, a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, and a pretty capable 50MP primary camera. Not to mention, Motorola's signature vegan leather finish just looks and feels great.</p><p>Sure, performance may not match up to today's Snapdragon 8 Elite and all its AI flourishes, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">mid-range Snapdragon chip</a> in the Stylus was no slouch either. Combined with great performance and a solid overall package, I would constantly forget that this is a mid-range phone. In fact, my mum wants a new phone, and I'm tempted to just get her the Stylus 5G 2024, as I wouldn't get her a phone that I myself wouldn't use.</p>

<p>We're just two months into 2025, and Motorola has already launched two phones in North America. On the surface, they don't seem like much, but they've managed to exceed our expectations about the kind of experience one can expect on a phone that costs $200. Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich found himself surprised at how much he liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, especially when compared to his experience with its predecessor.</p><p>"Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> was a pretty terrible phone, even for the low price, but Motorola has turned things around and addressed nearly every complaint I had without raising the price for this year's model," he states in his review. Sutrich highlights a bright, eye-friendly display, great design, and solid battery life as major selling points for the phone.</p><p>I had a similar experience with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, which launched alongside the Moto G 2025. The design is a welcome improvement over its predecessor, especially with the improved durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating. It also handles gaming surprisingly well and comes equipped with wireless charging, which isn't very common at this price point.</p><p>That's not to say these phones are perfect. The MediaTek chip can feel sluggish the first time you do something new on the phone, but it seems to catch up in no time. Motorola also improved its software update promise to now include two OS upgrades, although that's still a far cry from what you'll get on Samsung phones, for example.</p><p>Still, for what you're paying for, these phones could be much worse than they are. Yet it seems like Motorola and other companies are upping the standards for cheap Android phones. Even this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-bad-can-this-100-nuu-phone-be">$100 phone from NUU</a> is able to provide users with a half-decent experience with <em>zero</em> bloatware, a 90Hz display, great battery life, and more.</p><p>This is great for people who don't need all the latest AI features or to spend $800+ on the best of the best. It's especially great for parents who want to buy their kids their first phone.</p><p>This was also something that OnePlus understood with its Nord N-series phones, which offered surprisingly good value. And after seeing what the company did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, I can only imagine what a new Nord N phone would be like. If you're reading this, OnePlus, now would probably be a good time to introduce a new one.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning, and so far, I'm very excited about what's to come. After all, Motorola altered my expectations about cheap Android phones with last year's Stylus 5G 2024. Things can only go up from here as components get cheaper and better, and more capable chips trickle down to the lower end.</p><p>Qualcomm is already setting the stage for a new generation of midrange phones with more AI capabilities. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">Snapdragon 6 Gen 4</a> is an upgraded version of the same chip used in last year's Stylus, and it promises better performance as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, which is a first for the 6-series. This means we will start seeing more features normally reserved for flagship phones powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> on phones that cost half the price.</p><p>Qualcomm says Realme, OPPO, and Honor will be among the first to introduce phones with the new chip. There's no word on whether or not the next Moto G Stylus will sport the new Snapdragon 6 Gen 4, but I'm looking forward to whatever we get, regardless.</p><p>As someone who still loves high-end phones like the Razr and Galaxy S25 Plus, 2025 looks like a great year to start looking at cheaper phones, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-are-tariffs-going-to-make-my-next-phone-cost-more">threat of tariffs</a> looming over.</p>

<p>Comparing the Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2 is more complicated than you'd think. The Garmin Instinct 3 has both AMOLED and MIP Solar versions in multiple sizes, each with a different battery life. The Garmin Instinct 2 and smaller 2S each have solar and non-solar options, and there's an Instinct 2X that falls in the middle between these two generations.</p><p>All three watches are almost unparalleled for battery life — not counting the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Enduro 3</a>. The Instinct 3 Solar gives you a 5X boost in solar efficiency over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2 Solar</a>, but the gap is smaller for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> owners. And even though the Instinct 3 AMOLED has no solar recharge, it may last longer or shorter than the Instinct 2 Solar depending on your lifestyle.</p><p>Now you're starting to see why this guide isn't so straightforward! But we'll break down every key difference in hardware, design, software features, and battery life across each version and generation, to help you decide whether to upgrade, stick with your current watch, or buy a last-gen model on sale for a low price.</p><p>Our previous guides on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-vs-instinct-2">Instinct vs. Instinct 2 guide</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-vs-2-solar">Instinct 2 Solar vs. 2X Solar</a> break down last-gen differences for background information.

<h2 id="a-brief-garmin-instinct-3-amoled-vs-solar-breakdown-2">A brief Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED vs. Solar breakdown</h2>
<p>Before I compare the Instinct 3 vs. Instinct 2, I want to highlight key differences between the four Instinct 3 watches.</p>

<p>As you can see, the two 45mm models are slightly lighter and thicker than their 50mm counterparts. Both AMOLED watches have the same pixels per inch, while the smaller Instinct 3 Solar has a petite screen with a higher PPI than the 50mm Solar. The larger and smaller watches use 26mm and 22mm bands, respectively, but they should all fit the same wrist sizes.</p><p>Either MIP display is much lower-resolution and monocolored, while the AMOLED watches provide a real visual upgrade. They also add perks like on-screen workout animations, always-on display, or images from notifications that the MIP watches can't offer. But neither AMOLED nor MIP Solar has a touchscreen.</p><p>In exchange for a worse visual experience, the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar has fantastic battery recharging capable of stretching standard GPS tracking to last for weeks at a time — longer than the Instinct 3 AMOLED might last with <em>no</em> GPS tracking. Both 45mm Instinct 3 watches have a noticeable dip in battery life compared to their 50mm counterparts; you can see the differences above.</p><p>For the following sections, I'll only include the 50mm Instinct 3 AMOLED and Solar when comparing against the last-gen watches, to make the comparison less cluttered and easier to parse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-design" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another, showing the different display types." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Let's start with the Garmin Instinct series' trademark perk: Epic battery life. While the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar offered "unlimited" battery life, that was only in the context of never using GPS, using Max Battery mode (one GPS check per minute), or using Expedition mode (one GPS check per hour with no sensors or accessories). The efficiency of the solar panel wasn't especially strong.</p><p>You can see how the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar panel adds 200 estimated GPS hours of tracking, based on whether or not you're spending at least three hours a day in sunny conditions. Compared to that, the Instinct 2X Solar's 85 extra hours are respectable but well short; the Instinct 2 Solar's 18 hours felt significant back in 2022 but barely feels like a blip now.</p><p>Where the Instinct 3 Solar especially shines is for multi-band GPS tracking. Because that mode is so power-hungry, the Instinct 2X Solar could only add a few extra hours before it died. The newest model can still double your efficiency while offering the best location data that Garmin has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X" name="IMG_9784" alt="A post-run heart rate graph showing the runner's average and max heart rate across a two-mile track workout, with most heart rates in zone 4 (orange) or zone 5 (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED barely belongs in the same conversation as these MIP watches, but it's not as deficient as you might think. Its 40 GPS hours beat the Instinct 2 Solar's 30-hour estimate, only losing if you spend enough time outdoors in ideal conditions to get the recharge. You can enjoy a much better display and GPS accuracy without having to worry about the weather or hiking in the shade.</p><p>Should you upgrade for better battery life? Garmin Instinct 2X Solar buyers probably shouldn't unless they find a trade-in deal and really need an extra 100+ hours of GPS battery; you're already getting "unlimited" Max Battery or Expedition mode, so an Instinct 3 upgrade only applies if you need literal days of per-second GPS tracking and don't have any means of charging your Instinct 2X Solar overnight.</p><p>But if you have an older Instinct 1 or 2, your new battery boost will be at a whole other level — or else you can choose the Instinct 3 AMOLED and still get comparable or better battery life.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-design-and-display-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Design and display</h2>

<p>The changes across the Garmin Instinct series for this latest generation are fairly subtle. The Instinct 2X Solar is slightly heavier, but otherwise they're about the same size and weight, have the same military-grade durability against thermal, shock, and water damage, connect to the same accessories, and measure the same health data like heart rate, HRV, and blood oxygen.</p><p>While everyday people might find the Instinct series ugly — the 2X Solar scored last place in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> — fans of sporty watches will appreciate its classic look. Garmin gave the Instinct 3 a bit more personality with an aluminum bezel around the display edge that looks striking, especially on the limited-edition models that add color contrast to the bulky, monocolor silicone.</p><p>Garmin has given the memory-in-pixel Solar Instincts the same 176 x 176 resolution over the last couple of generations. That said, Garmin upped the visual contrast on the Instinct 2X compared to the Instinct 2, making it more readable, and while I haven't tested the Instinct 3 Solar myself, I've heard that this version is even more readable despite having the same pixels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All non-AMOLED Garmin Instincts have a second window that takes up visual real estate. Some Instinct 3 Solar buyers have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/01/31/garmin-instinct-3-solar-mini-display-off-centre/">complained about the data being misaligned within the circular space</a>, but it's hard to say how common these manufacturer defects are. The biggest issue is that this window — and the low resolution overall — prevent any possible maps, images, or full-screen graphs. Newer models are more readable, but none are fun to look at outside of workouts!</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has the same size and resolution as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, though slightly smaller than the 1.4-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. What's more relevant is that this display is non-touch, so you'll still have to rely fully on the Up/ Down buttons to navigate, and there is no map navigation. Still, you can trust me when I say that this upgrade makes the Instinct 3 much easier to read indoors and enables colorful graphs that look dull and blurry on the Instinct 2 or 2X.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="u79iUNx8x2msKhHeAyapEM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-side-view" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another, emphasizing their rugged designs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u79iUNx8x2msKhHeAyapEM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 2X added multi-band GPS over the GPS-only Instinct 2, matching the Instinct 3 for accuracy. The only difference is that the newer watch has SatIQ mode, which defaults to GPS alone unless the watch encounters signal interference and needs other GNSS or the L5 GPS frequency to pinpoint you. This saves hours of battery life but ensures better accuracy in tough conditions.</p><p>This mid-generation watch was also the first Instinct to add a built-in LED flashlight; the brightness is the same on the 2X and 3. It's good enough in a pinch but won't replace an <em>actual</em> flashlight or headlamp for night conditions. It burns through a healthy amount of battery, too, so the Instinct 3's more efficient solar panel might come in handy if you use it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-software-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Software</h2>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 2 shipped with most of the best Garmin Forerunner training tools available at the time, providing enough health and training load to help you become fitter and improve your VO2 Max. The gap between the Garmin Instinct 3 and 2 software isn't especially wide, but the new watches have more memory, leaving room for new feature updates that the Instinct 2 series will miss out on — and also eliminating some of the noticeable lag on the last-gen watches.</p><p>For now, the table above bolds those features that the Instinct 3 has that the 2X and 2 don't.</p><p>For health data, the Instinct 3 can detect naps for enhanced Body Battery data and will provide sleep coaching in your Morning Report. Otherwise, the data is identical, since they all use the same Elevate v4 sensors.</p><p>For general smarts, the Instinct 3 Solar isn't that different, but the AMOLED version will display notification images and (during Garmin Strength Coaching) display visual muscle maps and workout animations. It also has a large font option that the MIP watches lack. Only the Instinct 3 allows family and friends to watch you during a live event, but all the watches have a general LiveTrack tool if you want them to keep an eye on your progress during outdoor excursions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW" name="IMG_9785" alt="Exercise load bar graph on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the training front, serious athletes will appreciate having training load focus, which splits up your recent workouts into low/ high aerobic and anaerobic types so you know what types you need to focus on to improve, as well as your training load ratio comparing this week to past weeks.</p><p>If you want to do interval training, only the Instinct 3 shows a rest timer and has improved tools like auto-detected starts and open repeats. The same goes for auto-detecting when your multisport activity has switched to the next type, or for following PacePro guidance.</p><p>If you're a runner or cyclist who wants to analyze your form, the Instinct 3 has wrist-based running dynamics — the Instinct 2 and 2X required a separate pod — and cycling dynamics like Power Phase and right/left balance.</p><p>Lastly, Instinct 2 owners will get dozens of new sports modes on the Instinct 3 series: Indoor walking, virtual running, obstacle racing, golfing, disc golf, archery, cyclocross, BMX, water skiing, snorkeling, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, tubing, boating, whitewater, XC skate skiing, ice skating, pickleball, badminton, squash, table tennis, padel, platform tennis, racquetball, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, ice hockey, football/soccer, American football, lacrosse, rugby, ultimate disc, cricket, softball, baseball, boxing, mixed martial arts, motorcycling, overlanding, motocrossing, ATVing, and snowmobiling.</p><p>It's fair to say that most of these sports profiles won't apply to your lifestyle, but anyone with niche hobbies will find the Instinct 3 more helpful at tracking them.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 is an undeniable step up on every other Instinct before it. If you're deciding between a full-priced Instinct 3 or a discounted Instinct 2, I think perks like the revamped solar charging or AMOLED, multi-band GPS, flashlight, and aluminum bezel make it worth spending full price.</p><p>But as I've previously written, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">criticize the Instinct 3 Solar</a> for how similar it is to the Instinct 2X aside from the boosted battery life. If you own the Garmin Instinct 2X, I would hold off on buying the Instinct 3, simply because you just spent $450 and you'll get diminished returns.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED is my preferred choice from a visual perspective, it doesn't have a trademark skill like the Solar watches' unlimited battery life. It's just a rugged, bulky Forerunner 265. If you can accept the lack of a flashy new perk, this is undoubtedly one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available.</p><p>If you've owned an Instinct 1 or 2 for a couple of years, it's not a bad time to upgrade. Just make sure that you really need that extra Solar battery life, or that you can do without "unlimited" max-battery excursions for a better display.</p>

Yes, it was temporarily shut down in the U.S. following a short ban. But TikTok announced in mid-January 2025 that it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">in the process of restoring service</a> and the TikTok app is now back up and running.</p><p>As you scroll, you can share a link to a video with someone on the fly using the Share button. But sometimes, there are ones you want to be able to keep locally on your device. This might be to share with others when you’ll be somewhere without a connection, like deep in the woods while camping (and wanting to practice the latest dance trend), while on a boat without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, or even when traveling if you prefer to turn off data roaming. Maybe it’s just a favorite video you want to keep for posterity. It’s easy to download a TikTok video to watch offline, as long as the creator has not disabled the download option.</p>

<p>7. You’ll see the video you just saved and can play it without a connection. You can also <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>Share</strong> it as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-downloading-tiktok-videos-2">What else to know about downloading TikTok videos</h2>
<p>As noted, keep in mind that some creators disable the download option. If this is the case, you will not see the Save video option when you try to download it. If this option isn’t available, avoid trying to circumvent the rules and downloading the video through other means since the creator has not given permission for you to do so.</p><p>Even when you download a video, it will still have a TikTok watermark so the ownership of the video is known. Downloading it to watch at your leisure or share with friends while at the cabin without Wi-Fi is totally fine. Just remember never to pass off a downloaded video as your own or edit and re-post it in any manner without express permission from the content owner.</p><p>TikTok looks fabulous on all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> and while the app can be addictive, it’s important to be mindful of how much time you spend on the app as well as what you watch. Downloading videos from the site will take up valuable space on your device as well, so don’t forget to delete them once you no longer want or need them.</p>

They also retain the original Powerbeats Pro's iconic ear hook for stability and its $250 retail price.</p><p>For people still rocking the original Powerbeats Pro years later, is it time to finally upgrade to the Powerbeats Pro 2? Or, is there any reason to get the Powerbeats Pro in 2025? After spending over five years running with the Powerbeats Pro, and testing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> side-by-side with their predecessor for the past week, I'm ready to answer both questions.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-design-and-comfort-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Design and comfort</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Powerbeats Pro (top) above Powerbeats Pro 2 (bottom). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the new Powerbeats Pro 2 beside the original Powerbeats Pro, it's clear they're both similar and a lot different. Beats kept the general idea of Powerbeats intact, with a housing shaped like a bar and an ear hook for stability. However, it's not the same hook as the Powerbeats Pro. Instead of the adjustable ear hook on the first-generation earbuds, which could be molded and retained shape, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flexible ear hook. It's half the size and will still keep your headphones from falling out.</p><p>Smaller is a theme for the Powerbeats Pro 2. The earbuds are smaller overall despite housing more technology inside. Is this a good thing? That depends. After a lot of testing, through walks, runs, and daily use, I can definitively say that I find the original Powerbeats Pro more secure and comfortable. The bigger size actually fills up my ear better, adding to the stable feel.</p><p>That isn't to say that Powerbeats Pro 2 aren't comfortable. They come with five ear tip sizes, from XS to XL, and support the ear tip fit test. This is a software tool that will let you know if you're using the right ear tip size in the Beats app for Android or the settings app for iOS. Paired with the ear hook, there was never a time I was worried about the Powerbeats Pro 2 falling out.</p>

<p>Comfort is subjective, but I'd estimate the Powerbeats Pro feel about 10% more comfortable than the Powerbeats Pro 2. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to consider.</p><p>To get the best experience, you also have to wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly. With the new design, the bar needs to be pointing sharply upward, with the ear hook following the natural shape of your ear lobe. This is a departure from how the original Powerbeats Pro fit; they sat closer to the horizontal plane in your ear. If you don't wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly, the heart rate sensor won't be able to get accurate readings.</p><p>Another great thing about the Powerbeats Pro 2 is that it's still equipped with tactile, physical buttons. Each earbuds has a volume rocker at the top and play/pause button on the Beats logo. Again, the play/pause button feels <em>slightly</em> better on the originals — it's bigger and more pronounced — but the difference isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z9CuZ3ZoAQTfCWZSb2z5yE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-9" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z9CuZ3ZoAQTfCWZSb2z5yE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is smaller than that of the originals, but it's still double the size of the AirPods Pro 2 charging case. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is a massive upgrade. It now supports USB-C wired charging and Qi wireless charging. Beyond that, it's smaller, and it's finally pocketable — though you will be left with a bulge and it's still not perfect. In the photo above, you'll see the difference between the Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 2 charging case.</p><p>The new shape of the earbuds makes putting them into the charging case right a bit trickier. However, in my experience, they snap into place perfectly once you find the right spot. This is a big deal, because the original Powerbeats Pro had finicky and sensitive charging contacts, and were notorious for not charging properly.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-hardware-and-sound-quality-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Hardware and sound quality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 refresh is important because, unlike the AirPods Pro/AirPods Pro 2 refresh, the Powerbeats have design <em>and</em> hardware improvements. In fact, just like the Powerbeats Pro and AirPods Pro before it, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are very similar to the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of hardware. Both have an H2 chip for fast-pairing and low-latency connection for Apple products — including ultra-low-latency for Apple Vision Pro. Powerbeats Pro 2 also support one-touch pairing on Android, which the AirPods Pro 2 don't support.</p><p>Powerbeats Pro 2 add support for the ear tip fit test, Spatial Audio, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling (ANC)</a>, transparency mode, and voice isolation — all of which the original Powerbeats Pro does not support. Voice isolation will help clean up input from the Powerbeats Pro 2's six microphones (compared to the Powerbeats Pro's two), but is only available on iOS. As such, Android users will get a bit worse microphone quality than Apple users.</p><p>In terms of audio hardware, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are now equipped with a venting channel to avoid pressure, a high-output amplifier, and axial-aligned transducers. The latter simply means that the transducers are parallel to the acoustic nozzle, which means the sound will go straight into your ear without changing direction. In simple terms, the Powerbeats Pro 2 should sound better than the originals.</p>

<p>In the real world, though, the difference wasn't nearly as noticeable as it might sound. Both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and original Powerbeats Pro could handle music of all genres, with a slight preference to low-frequency sounds. Yes, that means Powerbeats Pro 2 sound excellent while listening to hip-hop/rap/R&B tracks from artists like the Wu-Tang Clan and SZA, but it also means they'll excel at jazz pieces from groups like Booker T. & the M.G.'s.</p><p>You won't want to upgrade from the Powerbeats Pro to the Powerbeats Pro 2 for sound quality alone. The huge differential just isn't there. However, you may want to upgrade for Spatial Audio, ANC, and transparency modes. ANC modes on the Powerbeats Pro feel equivalent to AirPods Pro 2 in terms of their capabilities, which is a huge compliment. I can block out just about any sound I need to, and let it in when necessary.</p><p>Transparency mode will be a game-changer for runners and cyclists. As a long-distance runner who likes to work out outdoors, I rarely wear both Powerbeats Pro earbuds. It just isn't safe. I need to hear cars, bikes, and generally be aware of my surroundings. With Powerbeats Pro 2, I can do that while wearing both earbuds.</p><p>Of course, we can't forget the optical heart rate sensor inside the Powerbeats Pro 2, which are the earbuds' headlining feature. It's essentially a miniature version of the optical sensor inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a>, and compiles readings from each earbud to create a measurement. It records a reading every five seconds, and is comparable to high-end fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> in my testing.</p><p>Heart rate monitoring (HRM) is arguably better on Android than iOS, because it's easier to manually control via the Beats app. It works with almost any device that supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors, including smartwatches. Is it a must-have feature?</p><p>Maybe, maybe not. I won't replace a dedicated fitness watch for Powerbeats Pro 2 anytime soon, but I could see why someone might. For example, certain activities — like weightlifting, core workouts, and yoga — can be difficult with a wearable on the wrist.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-battery-life-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-2" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple improved the battery life of the Powerbeats Pro 2, which helps offset any hit that HRM or ANC would've had. The original Powerbeats Pro could get 9 hours of playback on a single charge, plus an additional 15 hours via the charging case. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can get up to eight hours of playback on a single charge with an ANC mode active, plus an additional 28 hours via the charging case. With Adaptive EQ enabled, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can reach their maximum battery life of 45 hours including the case.</p><p>A quick five-minute charge gives you 1.5 hours of playback on both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and the originals. The Powerbeats Pro 2 charge from 0% to 100% in two hours.</p>

<p>Powerbeats have existed for 15 years now, and went through multiple iterations since they debuted in 2010. Powerbeats Pro 2 are very good workout headphones, but they are a slight departure from the familiar and consistent Powerbeats design and fit. As a result, I'm still fond of the Powerbeats Pro and would consider still using them for certain where perfect fit and stability is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Overall, the Powerbeats Pro 2 show why change is also necessary. The Powerbeats Pro had glaring flaws, from the charging case to the lack of ANC and transparency mode, and the Powerbeats Pro 2 seemingly fixed them all. It's hard to be disappointed when Powerbeats Pro fans got exactly what they wanted. And even if the Powerbeats Pro 2 are slightly less comfortable than their predecessor, they're still ahead of the competition by miles.</p><p>If you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best pair of workout earbuds today</a>, it's probably the Powerbeats Pro 2. They sound excellent, are comfortable, support ANC and transparency mode, and work well with iOS and Android. At $250, I'm absolutely willing to recommend these headphones — especially considering my first-generation pair is still in use after five years.</p><p>But let me tell you this: if you can live with Lightning charging and a bulky case, the original Powerbeats Pro are still a sneaky value buy at their new price of just over $100.</p>

Samsung explains that many of the AI features depend on what Samsung calls the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a> and that engine isn't supported on older chips; it needs the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> in order to work properly.</p><p>We'll see more of this as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic, or "thinking" AI</a> features, are developed, and you should expect to see some features on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> that will not come to the S25. And that's OK.</p>

<p>You should not buy a phone because you expect something in the future. A phone should do everything it is advertised to do, be mostly bug-free, and be supported to do those things as long as possible. Having seven years of support means your phone will probably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-shows-easily-removable-battery">outlast your battery</a>.</p><p>This isn't a Samsung thing. It's not even an Android thing. We're seeing the exact same from Google with the Pixel series and there will be multiple features that can't be used on the older hardware. The iPhone is the same, with iOS features becoming more hardware-dependent as AI is further integrated into the operating system.</p>

<p>I love this. You might not, and we can disagree, but knowing that a phone I buy in 2025 will still be supported and perform as expected in 2030 is excellent. I do not expect any new features and the ones that are developed are a bonus. Hopefully, any new features work as they should.</p><p>Phones are at a point where hardware is only a limiting factor when companies leverage those small incremental features they bring. Even more so when a company develops its own chip — either a full SoC package or custom coprocessors — that have a specific use.</p><p>Apple is a great example — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-plus-vs-iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-max">A16 Bionic</a> inside the iPhone 15 is as powerful as the chip that powers a typical laptop. It should be able to handle anything iOS has to offer. It's limited when it comes to AI because Apple dedicated parts of the newer chip to perform these functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Snapdragon or Tensor chip isn't nearly as powerful when it comes to raw processing, but they are more than a CPU, and parts of the chipset are doing very specific things. These parts just aren't inside older phones.</p><p>Forcing new features to work with "inferior" hardware would only make the features worse. Engineers love to develop new stuff and want everyone to use it, and phone makers love to lock new features behind the purchase of a new phone, but the reality is that sometimes there are real reasons why an older model can't do what it needs to do.</p><p>What's really important is that phone manufacturers are beginning to realize (or care) that we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/buying-new-phone-every-year-kind-crazy">don't need to buy a new phone every year</a> or even every two years. Some of us don't want to. I doubt very many people will use the same phone for seven years — even I would upgrade before then — but knowing that you could is awesome.</p><p>Now, we just need every phone maker to get on board and provide customer service as long as Samsung, Google, and Apple do, even if it means some of the new flashy stuff won't be included.</p>

At $299, it's by no means a flagship phone, so I knew very well what I was getting myself into. But while I have plenty of experience with flagships, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> I just reviewed, I always enjoy seeing how phones on the lower end improve.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 is a middle-of-the-road phone for Motorola that leans toward the low-end. That's something to keep in mind when looking at a phone priced just under $300. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, but it <em>does</em> come with a few surprises that we wouldn't have expected to see on such an affordable phone.</p>

<p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">launched</a> the Moto G Power 2025 on January 14, and the phone went on sale on February 6. It can be purchased unlocked directly from Motorola.com or retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy. The phone will also be sold through carriers, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket, AT&T, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Verizon, UScellular, and Consumer Cellular.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 will be available starting at $299, although pricing may vary depending on the retailer or carrier.</p><p>The phone will only come in two colorways: Leaf Green and Slate Gray. Availability of these colors may also depend on the retailer or carrier.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BtkSSHGpDnGenvPRArLHwC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-02" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down in snow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BtkSSHGpDnGenvPRArLHwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For years, Motorola's phones have had very basic designs, especially the budget Moto G series. The company has been switching that up in recent years, borrowing design cues from its higher-end Edge series like a seamless camera housing and vegan leather finishes. The Moto G Power 2025 is possibly the best-looking Moto G phone I've reviewed, in many ways looking more like a flagship than a $300 phone.</p><p>The phone only comes in two colors but the standout is the Leaf Green (not to be confused with the 2004 Pokémon game of the same name). It's incredibly vibrant, and the soft vegan leather is contrasted by the glossy camera rings, which add a nice flair. The frame of the phone also matches the color and sports a brushed finish. Fingerprints are pretty much non-existent on this phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4132px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-09" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 on the corner of a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4132" height="2324" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it's not just good looks that make this phone stand out; it's the build quality. The Moto G Power 2025 is one of the cheapest phones to sport an IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water and dust resistance rating. It may not seem like a huge deal, but this will ensure that the phone can not only handle being submerged but can also withstand high-pressure jets of water. Has anyone ever had their phone accidentally fall into a dishwasher right before they started a cycle? No? Just me? Well, now, that's one less thing you have to worry about.</p><p>I'm not brave enough to test this out myself, but Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich did just that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and it came out unscathed. I'll take his word for it.</p><p>The MIL-STD-810H certification is also a plus, especially since I've recently taken up skiing and tend to keep my phone in my pocket despite still being quite a novice on the slopes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-13" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down in snow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4120" height="2317" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola sticks with a Full HD+ LCD panel for the Moto G Power 2025, which is plenty bright and responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. Despite not being the brightest at 1000 nits, I haven't had any trouble viewing the display in any lighting conditions. The bezels are also pretty minimal despite the larger chin and <em>slightly</em> larger forehead.</p><p>The high refresh rate helps make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> feel very smooth when scrolling through apps and pages. There aren't any significant changes with Motorola's version of Android 15 since shifting its software to the new Hello UX with Android 14. It's a fairly clean and simple flavor of Android that doesn't feature too many extra flourishes, although it's dotted here and there with some of Motorola's fixins, like the new dual-panel Control Center/notification pane that more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are adopting.</p><p>Motorola also retains its useful gestures, which continue to be a favorite of mine. Chopping the phone twice turns on the flashlight, twisting twice enables the camera, and a double tap on the back can open apps or perform certain actions. I also love the Sidebar, which can be used to house your frequently used apps, and I think every OEM should have something like this (looking at you, Google).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="oDCm7e42QwoV7n4nMQSZyB" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-03" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDCm7e42QwoV7n4nMQSZyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance isn't as big of an issue as one might think. I haven't noticed many problems in this area, but it's important to manage your expectations to some extent. For instance, I can't get away with playing Honkai: Star Rail on its highest settings unless I wanna struggle through poor frame rates and barely functional gameplay. But the phone can surprisingly manage the game at visual settings set to "High" and at 60fps, which is honestly still a great way to play the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll also be happy to know that battery life is quite good. While I would like to see a 6,000mAh battery on the phone with "Power" in the name, the 5,000mAh capacity still gets the phone through a full day of regular use without issue. It's helped by 30W wired charging, which is still faster than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, and 15W wireless charging is a nice thing to have, even if it's not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2</a>.</p><p>Motorola is also doing a better job with its software promise. Previously, the company would offer one OS upgrade with three years of software updates. In 2025, the company is upping that for its budget phones with one additional OS upgrade, meaning the Moto G Power 2025 will support Android 17 when it launches, giving this $300 even more value.</p>

<p>While I mostly enjoy Motorola's flavor of Android, the downside of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> like this is that you're likely to find some level of bloatware. There are quite a few apps preinstalled that I don't want and wasn't given an option to opt out of. They're easy to uninstall, but that's just another step in the setup process that no one wants to deal with.</p><p>The silver lining is that the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">Glance lock screen</a> is disabled by default, although it still lingers in the lock screen settings. However, a new annoyance has seemingly replaced it in the way of the Weather app, powered by 1Weather. It's a pretty busy app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-theres-a-time-and-place-for-ads">filled with ads</a> and the constant ping of weather warnings that I largely don't care about or need. This one you can't uninstall, but you can disable it or turn off the notifications because, honestly, your best bet is to stick with Google's At a Glance widget.</p><p>And while you'll find quite a bit of bloatware, one thing you won't really find is AI. The Moto G Power 2025 is a pretty barebones, straightforward phone with none of the flair you'll find on more expensive models. Likely due to limitations with the chipset, you don't get things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">Magic Canvas</a>, or any of the other cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features. You do get Magic Editor and Magic Compose, although don't expect any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 features a <del>triple</del> dual camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultrawide that doubles as a macro sensor. The cameras are... usable. In good lighting, you can get a decent image, the shutter speed is pretty quick, and I don't hate the selfies taken with the 16MP front-facing camera. However, images are often noisy and lack detail. Lowlight images don't fare very well either.</p><p>One saving grace is the built-in Auto Enhance feature that you can switch on with a tap. It utilizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> to automatically improve images right after they're taken, adjusting colors, lighting, and more. Improvements can be subtle, but they help to make the camera more usable.</p><p>Oh, and there's a third rear sensor, but it's just an ambient light sensor and it doesn't seem to actually be much help here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one feature you'll want to turn <em>off</em> when you set up the Moto G Power 2025 is the RAM Boost. I'm already not a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM solutions</a>, and it's turned on by default on the Power, upping its 8GB to 12GB. While it feels like it should help, the phone felt quite sluggish in my initial use, especially when gaming. It wasn't until I turned off the RAM Boost that performance improved.</p>

<p>There are a fair amount of options for anyone looking for a $300 phone. The Moto G Power 2025 competes with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, which comes from Nothing's budget brand. It comes with a unique design with changeable backplates, a pretty good camera, and an AMOLED display, which isn't very common at this price point. That said, there's no NFC, and if you're in the U.S., network support is fairly spotty.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024">Galaxy A25</a> is also an option. Even though it's last year's model, the A25 comes with an OLED display, a 50MP triple camera system, and an impressive update promise with four OS upgrades and five years of software updates. However, if you're PWM sensitive, you may not find the display very pleasing to use. It also has a dated design with a waterdrop notch, and the Exynos chip can be quite sluggish.</p><p>Finally, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro</a>. This is also a 2024 model featuring an impressive 200MP camera, a sleek design, and great battery life. However, it's held back by hardware limitations, you'll find plenty of bloatware, and you may not wanna hold out for timely updates.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a cheap, no-frills phone.</li><li>You want a phone with great battery life and wireless charging.</li><li>You want a tough phone that will be able to take a beating.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a great camera.</li><li>You want access to Google AI features like Circle to Search.</li><li>You want a phone that can handle high-quality gaming without issue.</li></ul>
<p>In 2025, AI is the name of the game, but you won't really find that here. For $300, the Moto G Power 2025 is a solid budget phone that can get you through the day without weighing down the experience with a ton of superfluous features. It's for someone who just wants a phone that can do the basics, maybe play some games, and not much else. And honestly, that's great.</p><p>Maybe the camera could be better. Maybe the bloatware can be a little annoying. But these are the concessions you'll have to deal with at this price point, and frankly, the Moto G Power 2025 could be a lot worse. Instead, Motorola seems to be making the best out of what it could get with the Power, improving its software support, giving it flagship-level durability, and making it look better than any other $300 phone on the market.</p><p>Like the Moto G 2025, this phone surprised me, not because of how good it is, but because of how much worse it could be. It's not perfect, but you have to take it for what it is, and that's a pretty good cheap phone.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an update for the Google TV Streamer with bug fixes.</li><li>The update also brings the Google TV Streamer up to the January 2025 security patch in the Android Security Bulletin.</li><li>It removes Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio as detected audio codecs for the Google TV Streamer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out the second <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> patch update, and the first one of the year, with a few bug fixes and tweaks. The company doesn't explicitly say what is changed in each Google TV Streamer update, but rather lists "bug fixes and performance improvements" in the update's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-version" target="_blank">official release notes</a>. However, a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1imzoyw/new_update_for_the_google_tv_streamer_rolling_out/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> users have figured out that the latest Google TV Streamer update nixes advanced Dolby audio formats, possibly for good.</p><p>The update carries build number <strong>UTTK.241210.003</strong>, and comes with an update size of 329 MB (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-tv-streamer-update-2025/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It also includes bug fixes and security improvements up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-january-2025-security-patch-is-rolling-out-for-a-long-list-of-galaxy-phones">January 2025 patches</a> in the Android Security Bulletin. Interestingly, the official support document lists the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">current production firmware version</a> for the Google TV Streamer as <strong>UTT3.240625.001</strong>, but it'll likely be updated soon.</p><p>In the meantime, users on the Android TV subreddit have identified a few changes introduced with the latest Google TV Streamer update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-removes-audio-formats-3526493/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). It appears to have fixed an issue that caused certain Dolby Atmos outputs to freeze, preventing Dolby Surround from working properly. Additionally, it solves a problem with HDMI-CEC affecting volume control, per user reports. As part of the update, the TV Streamer's Voice Remote was updated to version 1.02.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1imzoyw/new_update_for_the_google_tv_streamer_rolling_out">New update for the Google TV Streamer rolling out</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV">r/AndroidTV</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Crucially, the update removes Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio as detected audio codecs for the Google TV Streamer. It appears to have ended a saga concerning high-fidelity audio on the TV Streamer. While the two Dolby audio formats were originally detectable on the Google TV Streamer, they were never available or functional. However, it was rumored that their mere existence could mean future support was possible.</p><p>With the latest Google TV Streamer update, the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio codecs have been axed entirely. As such, it looks like these formats were never coming to the Google TV Streamer, now that they're no longer showing up as detectable outputs.</p><p>While it may be a bummer for audio fans, the Google TV Streamer still supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital, and Dolby Digital Plus.</p>

The tipster states each Chinese OEM is looking to replace the notification-focused button with one that's more "customizable" — and it seems Apple may have influenced this. OPPO and OnePlus are rumored to develop a button similar to the iPhone's Action button.</p><p>The machine-translated post says this button could be called the "Magic Cube Key." This seems more like an internal name, but we'll have to see when/if it happens.</p><p>Additionally, DCS claims the button could let users "mute, customize the flash, screenshot, photo, translation, custom quick launch app" and more. Rumors say this button is aimed at "new phones," which makes us wonder if we'd see it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 14</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Android Central's Andrew Myrick said in 2023 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">OnePlus could implement</a> something similar to Apple's Action button due to its Alert Slider feature. Apple debuted the new button on the iPhone 15 Pro, which replaced the old physical mute button. The replacement still lets users mute audio, but it adds the ability to launch the camera app and the flashlight.</p><p>The button added even more customization by letting users launch their camera app in a specific mode of choice if the Action button is pressed.</p><p>In other news, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">recently confirmed</a> that its foldable successor, the Open 2, will not launch this year. In a blog post, the company's product manager, Vale G, said OnePlus was "recalibrating" its "foldable strategy." As a result, its next-gen foldable will not see its highly anticipated 2025 debut.</p><p>This is interesting considering OPPO and OnePlus typically share hardware specs and designs. However, the former isn't pulling back on its next foldable, the Find N5. That device is still gearing up for a February 20 launch. OnePlus likely needs more time to polish its foldable as Vale G stated, "...we believe this is the right approach for us at this time."</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> temporarily avoided disaster by reaching a temporary deal with Paramount to keeps its channels and properties available on the streaming services. As the two sides negotiated, YouTube TV announced Feb. 12 that Paramount channels might disappear as it was unable to reach what it considered "a fair deal." However, it later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Paramount channels would continue to be available on YouTube TV in the near future as the two sides continue to find a long-term solution.</p><p>"We’ve reached a short term extension as we work toward a deal with Paramount to keep their content on YouTube TV. YouTube TV subscribers continue to have access to Paramount channels, including CBS, and any recordings that are in their Library," the company wrote in the blog post. "We appreciate your patience as we continue to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Paramount's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement."</p><p>It's unclear how long this short-term extension will last. Paramount provides 34 channels on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, including CBS, CBS Sports, MTV, Comedy Central, and regional stations. It also enables extra services, like Paramount Plus with SHOWTIME and BET Plus.</p><p>YouTube TV customers are frustrated by the developments, as the streaming service recently increased prices by $10, from $73 to $83, just one month ago. Additionally, the timing of the rights dispute is unfortunate, with March Madness (the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) and The Masters tournament coming up in March and April — airing on CBS and CBS Sports.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out an update for the Contacts app that brings more customization and uniqueness to your saves.</li><li>Users will soon find a "Monogram" tab that lets them customize a letter-based or emoji-based profile icon for contacts.</li><li>Google has been slowly working on upgrading its Contacts app by implementing a total redesign and revamped creation page.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly in the early stages of a Contacts app update that lets you set quirky pictures for people you know.</p><p>AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contacts-creative-contact-pictures-3524348/">Android Authority</a>) spotted an update for the Contacts app, which brings a third "Choose Picture" option for saved numbers. Users should soon notice a "Monogram" tab on the far right of the usual "Device Photos" and Google Photos choices. Tapping Monogram lets users edit a letter-based profile icon that mirrors what you'd normally find for saved contacts.</p><p>The core of this addition is the circular profile icon with the (defaulted) letter "A." Users can tap this and customize it by inputting the letter of their choice. Beneath, there's an "Inspire Me" button, which the tipster states will "automatically set the font and background color."</p><p>Within the Monogram tab is a secondary profile option called "Emoji." From here, users can follow the same steps and tap the center to assign an emoji for a saved contact. The emojis offer a little extra as users can choose to have a fully colorized character represent their contact. Think of a full red heart or a bright yellow sun. The second option, titled "Monochrome," changes the tone.</p><p>From the tipster's example, it doesn't turn your contact's icon black and white, instead, it mirrors Android's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-enable-themed-icons-in-android-13">Themed Icons</a>." The emoji loses its color and takes on a light and dark theme per your chosen background.</p><p>The Monogram and Emoji photo options let users decide between six colors and five font styles (monogram only).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.79%;"><img id="B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c" name="google-contacts-monogram-profile-icon-option" alt="Google Contacts' latest update lets users customize their saved contact's profile icon with a monogram letter or an emoji." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="633" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tipster claims the update is rolling out with Google Contacts v4.48.27.720; however, they haven't received it yet. We've checked on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a> and the update isn't available. So, the update is likely slowly making its way onto Android devices as we close the week.</p><p>Google has been working on refreshing the Contacts app for a while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-navigation-update-custom-ringtones">with updates like its total redesign</a> last March. One of the major changes was the removal of the navigational drawer for a dropdown menu, instead. Elsewhere, the primary contact creation page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-less-cluttered-creation-redesign-spotted">was redesigned to be simpler</a>. In short, Google placed the most important aspects of your contact, like their first name, last name, company, and phone number first.</p><p>The redesign gave larger buttons for other, commonly used additions like their email and more under that. Regarding auxiliary options (middle name, suffix, and prefix), Google shoved those into an "add fields" button at the bottom.</p><p>The company was also spotted working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-quicker-video-call-process-tipped">initiating video calls</a> even quicker through Contacts.</p>

<hr>
<p>ByteDance's TikTok has reportedly returned to app stores in the U.S. following the U.S. government's reported "reassurances."</p><p>According to Mark Gurman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">Bloomberg</a>, TikTok was first spotted reappearing on the Apple App Store. Users on X chimed in, reporting that the app had returned as early as Wednesday, February 12. Experiences vary as some had more difficulties than others, but it seems more widely available for Apple's iPhones today (Feb 14.)</p><p>Additionally, the publication reports that the app has reappeared on the Google Play Store. Android Central has also spotted TikTok's availability via the Play Store, so users who may have deleted the app or never had it before can download it.</p><p>The publication states that TikTok's return to Google and Apple resulted from a letter from the U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi. The letter supposedly offered consolation that the proposed U.S. ban wouldn't "immediately" take effect.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us" target="_blank">U.S. government originally banned TikTok</a> on January 19 after its parent company, ByteDance, declined to sell the app. This followed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">bill signed into law</a> in April 2024, which targeted the app over its Chinese ownership and the possibility of a "national security threat." U.S. users were left with a message when opening TikTok, highlighting its ban, but there was some hope.</p><p>TikTok stated "President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate" the app <em>after </em>his inauguration.</p><p>The company started working with service providers to restore TikTok's services for users in the U.S., despite the app's removal from stores. However, there's still a lot of work to do. Bloomberg states TikTok has 75 days (from Jan 20) to work with the U.S. government to find common ground with privacy/security concerns over its citizen's data. This means we'll have to wait and see if TikTok is back for good in April 2025.</p><p>The publication adds that ByteDance remains against divesting any part of TikTok to the U.S. The Chinese-based company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">stood firm on that sentiment last year</a>, stating it would rather ditch its U.S. presence than sell. ByteDance said the "special algorithms" used for TikTok would make selling the app difficult. Moreover, these algorithms are a crucial part of the app's business, and trying to make things work in a sell might cause more harm.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> looks to be an amazing phone. Without having touched one, I think the pros far outweigh the cons; if you need a new phone and are ready to pay flagship pricing, the S25 Ultra is definitely worth looking at.</p><p>It's not without its fair share of controversy, of course. You have the whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 without any magnets</a> issue that plenty of people don't like because they want or need to magnetically stick things to the back of their phone.</p><p>I expected this when the WPC had to rework the Qi2 spec to include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>" devices that lose the magnetic requirement, and have no real opinion on it. Buy the case with magnets if you really need it and the issue is solved.</p>

<p>What can't be fixed, though, is the dumbing down of the S Pen. Samsung removed the Bluetooth functionality of the S Pen with the S25 Ultra, claiming that fewer than 0.5% of users were taking advantage of the feature. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">it's never coming to the S25 Ultra</a> because crucial hardware isn't in place and the software to control it has been removed from the device.</p><p>Surprisingly, most of that hardware is still in place inside the Pen itself. The circuit board and wiring exist, but the board itself doesn't have the tiny components in place. Without knowing exactly what the part numbers of those components were, I can still estimate that they cost about $2.00. In other words, Samsung is probably saving two bucks per phone by removing the S Pen's advanced features.</p><p>This is dumb. You should never nickel and dime your way to a higher profit margin on your most upscale and premium product. If you want to sell a device that costs $1,300, you need to find another way to increase your margins.</p>

<p>This isn't something most people will care about. The removal of things like the headphone jack or SD card affected everyone, so outrage was expected, but Samsung is right when it says that almost nobody used the Bluetooth functions of the S Pen, so almost nobody is affected by this.</p><p>That doesn't matter because of <em><strong>who</strong></em> is affected: Samsung's "elite" fanbase. These are users who buy the Galaxy S Ultra every year because of things like an advanced active stylus that's deeply integrated into the operating system. Even if they'll never use them, features like this are the reasons why the Galaxy S Ultra is the best phone money can buy in their eyes.</p><p>Yes, the savings are massive — $2 per phone and 25 million phones sold is $50 million — but is the black eye worth it? This path only leads to losing some of your elite users while you save some money.</p>
<p>I have no skin in this game. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/for-me-the-right-time-to-buy-a-galaxy-s25-is-next-year">I'm not interested in buying a Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> (though I would recommend it to a few people I know), and even if I were, I'm not worried about a smarter S Pen. But I do know what looks good and what looks bad from a customer's point of view because I am a customer first and a tech writer second.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised to see both magnetic Qi2 charging and the return of Bluetooth for the S Pen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">S26 Ultra</a>, but I also wouldn't be surprised not to see them. It all depends on which choice Samsung thinks is best for its bottom line.</p>

<ul><li>Duolingo's owl mascot is dead, and the company seems to be desperately looking for the culprit.</li><li>The company has been posting on all its social media accounts dropping hints on what caused the Owl's death.</li><li>Recently, it took to X to announce that all its characters have faced similar deaths, pointing to an impending social media stint.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The language-learning app Duolingo announced on X earlier this week that its fun Owl mascot has died, and the cause of the bird's death is still under investigation.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1889328809054224698">post</a>, the company stated that the authorities are currently investigating the cause and that it's cooperating with them. It also added, "We're aware he had many enemies, but we kindly ask that you refrain from sharing why you hate him."</p><p>It jokingly pointed at the Duolingo users, who could be the reason behind the bird's passing. "Tbh (to be honest), he probably died waiting for you to do your lesson, but what do we know."</p><p>In the midst of all this,  the company didn't miss a beat to ask users to subscribe to Duolingo Max as a memory of the beloved bird.</p><p>While we feel that this hints at another collaboration or rebranding, the brand also took a moment to mention Dua Lipa at the end of the statement. It could also be because they have similar-sounding names and have frequently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7398184301810044191" target="_blank">posted videos</a> showing the two as a couple.</p><p>In a fun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7470231646059679022" target="_blank">TikTok video</a>, Duolingo's other characters, Lily and Zari, were seen carrying the owl's coffin around the office and then to a pickup truck that took the bird away.</p><p>In a follow-up tweet, the company posted a video of the bird being hit by a Telsa Cybertruck, the owl passing through different realms of the universe, and a reward for whoever can identify the driver.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: Reward for whoever can identify the driver.

<p>As the suspense to uncover the culprits keeps mounting, Duolingo took to X on Feb. 13 to announce that all its characters are now dead, with a caption stating that it "believes in transparency and wanted to share this heartbreaking update. We are investigating and want to keep all informed."</p><p>Duolingo's profile picture has been updated to a dead owl, so we aren't sure where the company is going with all these 'deaths.' In another follow-up video posted this morning (Feb. 14), Duolingo reveals the reason other mascots from the office have died but nothing about the owl. Watch below.</p>

After explaining why I'm excited about the OnePlus Open 2, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">announced</a> that it wouldn't actually be releasing a successor to the OnePlus Open.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1652471315484901379">Community Forum post</a>, the reason for this is explained as being a "recalibration" while also giving props to the upcoming OPPO Find N5. It also says that OnePlus is "committed to developing products that will redefine multiple categories and bring you experiences that are as innovative and exciting as ever."</p><p>But here's the thing — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Find N3 were essentially the same phone, just with a different logo. The merging of OPPO and OnePlus has grown even more, as OxygenOS and Color OS are practically identical, just with the appropriate branding. So instead of following that recipe again, which clearly worked, OnePlus is taking a step back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 shown next to iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Find N5 will see a global release, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to get one in the States unless you import one. Maybe OPPO will surprise us during the Find N5 launch event, but I wouldn't hold my breath.</p><p>So, what does this mean for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>? Well, it certainly doesn't bode well for the state of foldable phones in North America. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is fantastic in most aspects. However, the Tensor G4 doesn't match up to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, let alone the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The cameras are better than that of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 but aren't as good as the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is more focused on figuring out ways to put its foldables on the back burner. For example, the stable version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is only available with the Galaxy S25 series, while the beta is still limited to just the Galaxy S24 series. And we have no idea or indication as to when Samsung's $1,800 phone will get the latest software update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's still a bit too early for even the rumor mill to start churning out information about the next Pixel foldable. And all signs point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> being a slightly improved version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold SE</a> that saw a limited release last year.</p><p>So, barring anything unexpected, we're in store for what will probably shake out to be another boring year. However, there seems to be a decent chance that won't be the case once 2026 rolls around.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1094873855464599552">report</a> has been making its rounds suggesting Apple will finally enter the foldable phone game in late 2026. The company has been rumored to be working on a foldable phone for years, but development reportedly picked up steam in late 2024, with Apple beginning to work with display manufacturers.</p><p>According to the report, Apple is expected to go with a book-style foldable with its first attempt. It is said to be 9.2mm thin when folded, while "the internal screen is comparable to two 6.1-inch phones folded together, resulting in a total size of over 12 inches."</p>

<p>I'm not 100% convinced that Apple would release an iPhone with such an enormous screen. I do think that we're going to end up with something that looks more like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and less like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's still just conjecture, and we're likely months away (at least) from any substantive rumors or leaks. And with OnePlus opting against releasing the Open 2 in 2025, things are looking pretty grim for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. With that in mind, Apple is probably now the only company that could spark excitement for foldable phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-bottom-view-alt.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 bottom view comaprison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The aforementioned report suggests Apple will sell between eight and ten million units in 2026 before that number doubles to 20 million in 2027. Oh, and who would be making the display? Reportedly, it's "exclusively developed by Samsung."</p><p>So, while OnePlus ripped out my heart just in time for Valentine's Day, I might again need to rely on Apple to pick up the pieces of what's left. Seriously, man, this sucks.</p>

Even though OnePlus didn't launch a successor in 2024, the Open held up incredibly well against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> — which tells you a lot about Samsung's strategy. <br><br>I was excited for the Open 2, but the foldable has been put on ice — indefinitely. OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1652471315484901379">announced on its forums</a> that it will not launch a foldable this year, with OPPO instead taking the lead with the Find N5. "At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year."<br><br>OnePlus says it isn't exiting the category entirely, but even if it were to launch a device next year, it would effectively have to start from scratch, and I don't understand why the manufacturer isn't debuting the Find N5 in global markets as the Open 2. This is what it did with the Open — which was a rebranded Find N3 — so to not do the same in 2025 feels short-sighted.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C8EQsGDeoes3L9gEtMmphK" name="oneplus-open-37.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C8EQsGDeoes3L9gEtMmphK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is basically ceding ground to Samsung in this category, and with the Open 2 not launching this year, there isn't a meaningful rival to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> outside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3</a>, but neither foldable is available in North America. Availability in the region was what gave the Open a distinct advantage, and OnePlus is losing out on that this time. <br><br>OPPO has good presence in Asia and is once again starting to sell its products in select western markets, but it doesn't have a foothold in North America — the region was seen as OnePlus's territory within the BBK conglomerate. While I'm excited to use the Find N5 — it promises to be the thinnest foldable yet — it won't be sold in anywhere as many regions, and that's annoying. <br><br>OnePlus's strategy just doesn't make any sense to me. Obviously, the Open wouldn't have sold in nearly as many numbers as the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12, but it built a strong foundation for the manufacturer, and to not expand on that is the wrong move. If anything, the Open 2 was set to be the biggest challenger to Samsung's dominance in North America, and as the device isn't launching now, there's even less incentive for the brand to introduce any meaningful changes with the Z Fold 7.</p>

By contrast, Google's decision to play it safe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> feels shortsighted, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> doesn't bring any meaningful upgrades in this area.</p>

<p>I used over a dozen phones powered by the latest chipsets in the last three months, and it's time to take a look at how they differ. Before I get to the benchmarks, a quick overview of what's new this year. Obviously, we need to start with Qualcomm, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite is different to what we've seen in the past. <br><br>Qualcomm went to a fully custom CPU design in a move that's similar to what Apple does with its own silicon, and it allowed the chip vendor to fine-tune the platform by a considerable amount. It isn't astonishing, then, that the platform has the best single-and multi-core CPU scores of anything I tested, and it even outmatches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> — a huge deal in and of itself. <br><br>The gains with the GPU aren't as noticeable, and while it continues to be one of the best around, it doesn't have an outsized lead. Thankfully, MediaTek was also able to deliver a platform that's fantastic, and the Dimensity 9400 has enticing upgrades. Although it uses stock Arm cores, MediaTek's decision to exclusively leverage big cores makes a clear difference when it comes to performance. MediaTek has been doing this for two years now, and it nailed the fundamentals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Ultra and X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the GPU on the Dimensity 9400 is able to hold its own against what Qualcomm is offering. That just hasn't been the case in previous years, and I even managed to get better scores with the Immortalis-G925 than the Adreno 830. Qualcomm still leads the way with sustained performance, but it's great to see MediaTek gaining ground in this key area. <br><br>There isn't much to talk about the Tensor G4, as Google is using the same core configuration and manufacturing node as the G3. While Qualcomm and MediaTek made the switch to a 3nm node — delivering big gains in efficiency — Google is still using the 4nm node, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't quite have the same battery longevity. <br><br>I'm using ASUS's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> as the Qualcomm baseline as it has a good thermal solution while still technically being a mainstream phone. I went with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> to highlight the Dimensity 9400; while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> also uses the same platform, I felt that the X200 Pro did a better job at gaming, so that's the one I'm using. And with Google, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermal management system in the Pixel 9 series, so that's the one I used.</p>

<p>When it comes to the CPU, it's clear that Qualcomm has a definite edge this year. The custom design allowed devices like the Zenfone 12 Ultra and Honor Magic 7 Pro to net the best scores in Geekbench 6's single- and multi-core workloads, and I don't see this changing over the course of 2025. The Dimensity 9400 does a great job as well, and while it is faster than last year, it doesn't outshine Qualcomm. <br><br>As you can imagine, the Pixel 9 Pro XL lags behind its rivals, posting scores that just don't measure up — the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> does a better job. Annoyingly, it's a similar story with the GPU as well, and the device just doesn't come close to 2025 flagships. That said, I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use, and if anything, Google did a great job with optimization with the Android 15 update, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has much better fluidity than previous years. <br><br>The biggest issue is that the 9 Pro XL just doesn't deliver the same level of performance in demanding games. You don't get stable framerates, it throttles too soon, and it doesn't even measure up to Qualcomm and MediaTek's 2024 offerings, much less their latest platforms. <br><br>Google says it positioned on-device AI as the differentiator with the Tensor G4, but even in this area, it doesn't do anywhere as well as Qualcomm. It has a slender lead over the Dimensity 9400 in Geekbench's AI workloads, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra once again has the distinct edge, with Qualcomm's NPU clearly the one to beat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BavKZKQ67owN3X36CAA3WR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra running Balatro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BavKZKQ67owN3X36CAA3WR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to gaming, the Immortalis-G925 in the Dimensity 9400 delivered the best scores in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme and Solar Bay tests. That said, the platform tends to throttle aggressively, and the X200 Pro had a stability score of just 49% in the demanding Steel Nomad Light endurance run. By contrast, Qualcomm-powered devices managed a score of at least 70%, with most devices going up to 90% in the same test. <br><br>The downside to limited throttling is that Qualcomm-based devices tend to run hotter. The X200 Pro went up to a maximum of 44 degrees Celsius after an extended gaming session, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra hit 46 degrees, and Nubia's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Z70 Ultra</a> got up to 59 degrees — the highest of any phone I tested. <br><br>Synthetic tests don't reveal the whole story, but having used these devices for an extended amount of time, what's clear is that both Qualcomm and MediaTek have done a fabulous job this year. I'm glad that MediaTek is able to deliver a product that goes up against Qualcomm in the high-end category — that just hasn't been the case in previous years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera module highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another interesting point is the ISP; while Qualcomm continues to make gains in this area, MediaTek outdid itself this year, with the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro delivering the best camera packages of 2025. Of course, the camera hardware and tuning makes a sizeable difference, but the ISP on the Dimensity 9400 is an integral part of the package, and MediaTek did all the right things. <br><br>It's a similar situation with battery life. The key talking point is the introduction of silicon-carbon battery tech, and Dimensity 9400-powered devices have a clear edge when it comes to battery life. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and Vivo X200 Pro have identical 6000mAh cells, the X200 Pro managed to last longer in my testing, delivering an additional hour of screen-on-time. <br><br>I didn't do any quantitative battery testing, but my usage across devices is roughly unchanged, and the two phones that delivered the best battery life are the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro, both powered by the Dimensity 9400. Ultimately, both Qualcomm and MediaTek did a standout job with their 2025 designs, and while MediaTek is seeing better design wins, Qualcomm continues to dominate the North American market. I don't see that status quo changing anytime soon, but what's refreshing is that MediaTek has a viable alternative in the Dimensity 9400 in other global markets.</p>

Beneath, the provided image is of a Snapdragon SoC with a specific white and red chip image.</p><p>Nothing adds, "Our perfect match for elite performance. Now powering up the (3a) Series."</p><p>On Qualcomm's side, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Snapdragon/status/1890061457574035576">quote-reposted</a> a quick video from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei discussing the Phone 3a. Pei announced the return of Qualcomm's Snapdragon series chips on the next-gen (a) series phone, while also detailing some notable improvements. According to Pei, the Phone 3a will boast a 25% increase in CPU speed and a 72% quicker NPU compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>.</p><p>That device features the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro.</p><p>Additionally, Pei says the company has worked to improve the Phone 3a's camera, based on user feedback. The device's cameras will reportedly be more "efficient" than before.</p>

<p>While neither side has confirmed the chip for the Phone 3a, many users in the replies believe it to be the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. This <em>could </em>be true, mainly because the official images of this chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">when it launched</a>, looked the same as what Nothing teased today (Feb 13). Furthering this is a leak from December concerning the Phone 3a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-future-trio-specs-database-leak">in the IMEI database</a>.</p><p>The listing showed the device supported by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a chip designed for budget phones, but with loads of AI capabilities. The chip was also stated to deliver a better camera and gaming experience while also supporting the Baichuan-7B and Llama 2 AI models.</p><p>There's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">that leaked memo</a> from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei that suggested it could take bigger strides toward on-device AI.</p><p>That aside, at the end of January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">Nothing confirmed</a> that the "Phone 3a Series" was launching on March 4 at 5 am ET.  Users can sign up to stay in the loop about the phone via nothing.tech, so you're ready for launch (and pre-orders if interested). The company recently teased a hardware change for the Phone 3a by way of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">physical camera button</a>.</p><p>It seems users will be able to take photos without tapping their screens, similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 16.</p>

<ul><li>Google is updating Gemini Live to use the latest AI models, likely one of the Gemini 2.0 stable or experimental models.</li><li>It's also changing the Gemini privacy policy, saying that audio, video, and screen share data may be collected.</li><li>Google will also bring screen sharing and live video streaming support to Gemini Live in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is upgrading <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> with a new AI models, and is planning a few fresh features to upgrade the experience. It announced the changes in an email to some Gemini Live users late Wednesday, Feb. 12. The move comes after Google recently updated the chatbot in the Gemini app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">to use the latest Gemini 2.0 stable and experimental models</a>.</p><p>"Google is starting to roll out updates to Gemini to make your conversations even more dynamic and engaging," the email reads. "With our latest model, Live can better understand multiple languages, dialects, or accents in a single Live chat and help with your translation needs."</p><p>While Google does not explicitly state which Gemini model is powering the new Gemini Live experiences, it stands to reason it's one of the new AI models in the Gemini 2.0 family. Announced late last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0 models</a> build on the Gemini 1.5 series, and perform comparably to the latest OpenAI models in their category. Since then, Google has been steadily delivering various experimental and stable Gemini 2.0 models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, and Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental.</p><p>You can read the full email from Google in the screenshot provided by Android Central below.</p>

<p>The email update also previews two new Gemini Live features coming later: screen sharing and live video streaming. It communicates new data sharing settings for Gemini Live, noting that user audio, video, and screen shares will be stored by Google.</p><p>"As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5r_VZJXj-0CEZg0HMLcsbjRwAsrOtRS1mQA5HOQpeS4OQ6iIFGQMR-3zzNz2Tr_5ni-I8y5GQRCszWKXFKIM5XYvsTiLXfOWK6QNEK2rKm2ZY1yES9axb5npns7wIgwQ8Xb6I4uynNamH2jEaM57JIRkEnqyYqnNnkGDt-5A_0" target="_blank"><strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong></a> (if it’s on)," Google explains.

However, the company does say that it would be "transparent if that changes," and this email seemingly fulfills that promise.</p>

<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/12/gemini-live-model-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> points out, Gemini Live could be planning to integrate the Multimodal Live API that was showcased alongside Gemini 2.0. The live-streaming capabilities could refer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra</a>, which we tried at Google I/O 2024.

<ul><li>A Korean Samsung community forum user posted a screenshot of the February 2025 security patch hitting the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The patch is light on S25-specific fixes/additions; however, there's a large amount of security flaw fixes this month.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 received its update earlier in February, which is on a sour note as it's still based on Android 14 while it awaits another One UI 7 beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been spotted pushing its first monthly patch to its newest flagship smartphone trio.</p><p>Notice of the February 2025 security patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/25%EC%8B%9C%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%88-2%EC%9B%94-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88%ED%8C%A8%EC%B9%98-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8/td-p/31728962">was spotted by a user</a> in Samsung's Korean forums (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/first-galaxy-s25-software-update-released/">SamMobile</a>). The user stated the update had hit their Galaxy S25, which means the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra should also have it shortly. The patch bears firmware number S93xNKSU1AYB3 and concerns the One UI 7 (Android 15) software the latest trio launched with.</p><p>The user provided a screenshot of their device's software update notice. This first patch is incredibly light as Samsung details "stabilization" improvements (machine-translated). Additionally, the brief changelog states the company has applied Google's Android-related security patches for this month, too.</p><p>For Google's side, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-02-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> lists 17 "High" level framework fixes and five "High" system fixes for February.</p><p>Samsung always packages these with its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb"> own set of security fixes</a> and, this time, that involves "7 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE)." The Korean OEM detailed a fix that should remove an attacker's ability to "cause memory corruption" on its Galaxy S25 devices. A second fix involves Qualcomm's chipsets, which states attackers should no longer be able to "read and write out-of-bounds memory."</p><p>The patch has only been spotted in South Korea so far. Since the week is at its end, those in other areas (like the U.S. and Europe) <em>may </em>see it sometime next week. If you're curious, you can always continue to check your device manually for the February 2025 patch.</p><p>The latest flagship series grabs its monthly patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-february-2025-patch-for-galaxy-s24-arrives-amid-one-ui-7-delays">shortly after</a> the Galaxy S24 series did at the top of the month. That patch was also pretty light on S24-specific fixes; however, the same slew of security flaws were fixed, like with the S25 series. Moreover, the patch for the Galaxy S24 is a little sour considering those users are still waiting on One UI 7 (Android 15). The current patch is based on One UI 6.1.1. (Android 14).</p><p>If you missed it, Samsung had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">reportedly pushed back</a> the official rollout of One UI 7 for the Galaxy S24 (and others) due to another problem. It was discovered that using "Natural" mode in its screen optimization menu caused the phone's display to turn more yellow than intended. The company stated it was confident that the problem would be rectified in Beta 4, but that means more waiting for stable users.</p><p>It's not all bad as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">Samsung confirmed</a> One UI 7 was coming "imminently" to its past-gen Galaxy S phones.

It's the latest Meta Quest 3 game from veteran VR developer Survios, known best for the Creed series of VR and non-VR games, plus a handful of VR classics like Raw Data and Sprint Vector.</p>

<p>While the game was released on PC VR and the PSVR 2 on December 19, 2024, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> version was delayed two months, almost certainly to remake most of the game's visual assets to fit better on Quest. Aside from lower-quality assets when compared to the PlayStation or PC releases, Survios also tweaked the lighting in many areas to work better for the Quest 3's screens and power.</p><p>It's not these changes that are so offensive, though. Rather, it's the resolution and downright sub-par performance. It's the lowest-resolution game I can recall ever seeing on Quest 3, and the game still chugs when moving between areas. Developer Survios says a patch is coming as early as next week (at the time this is written) to address these issues, but until then, gamers will have to deal with them.</p><p>But if you can get past the poor visuals, you'll be treated to one of the better action-horror games on the Meta Quest platform. That's especially true if you enjoy the Alien movies and the sci-fi universe within them. Alien: Rogue Incursion is Part 1 of at least a 2-part game series, although Part 2 doesn't have a definitive release date just yet.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The on-body inventory system is among the very best I've used in any VR game.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>From the moment the game began, I knew I was in for something special as far as gameplay goes. The intro is simple enough but also introduces a great way to get the player used to the game's mechanics without feeling obtuse. Alien: Rogue Incursion uses a combination of shooting, puzzle-solving, and key card-hunting gameplay mechanics to excellent effect.</p><p>The on-body inventory system is among the very best I've used in any VR game. Two large guns can fit on your back — shotgun over your left shoulder, assault rifle over the right — a pistol on your right hip, ammo on your left hip. Grabbing the ammo always presents the right kind for the gun you're carrying, assuming you have enough ammo in your inventory.</p><p>On the left arm, you'll find healing syringes on the forearm and grenades attached to the shoulder. The right shoulder holds the motion tracker, which is always active, giving you forewarning of anything moving in the shadows. Picking it up will let you scan the surroundings and get a rough idea of the direction Xenomorphs are coming from, but not much else. It helps get rid of cheap jump scares and allows you to prepare for battle rather than being surprised all the time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Problems from the initial release in December have all been addressed, including better enemy difficulty and spawn rates and weapon handling bugs squashed.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The initial launch was met with plenty of criticism, from ridiculous spawn rates of Xenomorphs — which made it feel more like an arcade game than an action-horror one — to bugs with guns and a distinct lack of ammo to be found. All of these issues have been addressed in the Meta Quest 3 launch and the subsequent patch has also been issued to the PC and PS5 versions.</p><p>Now, the balance feels nearly perfect. Aliens take 2-3 direct hits from a shotgun to dispatch — a weapon you don't even have for the first hour or two of the game — roughly 30 bullets from the assault rifle or a few rounds from your pistol. Meanwhile, two shots from a Xenomorph will be the end of you, so you'll need to be strategic about every encounter you get in. Most Xenomorphs travel in packs, and you'll do your best to remember that.</p><p>Gun handling is superb, although I don't like the sound of the assault rifle. It sounds tinny and hollow compared to the punchier sounds from the pistol and shotgun. Placing a sticky grenade as a trap for oncoming Xenomorphs never seems to get old, although the physics of Xenomoph deaths tend to be more comical than realistic. Maybe comic relief is needed to keep the tension down.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Tools and weapons have a very satisfying tactile feel. Survios has been honing these kinds of interactive systems for a decade now, and it shows.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Throughout the game, you'll make your way across a research base on a remote planet to unravel the events that occurred. Everyone at the station has either fled or is dead, and it's not long until you figure out why. Since you're the only living human there, getting around through locked-down, high-security areas requires a bit of work. Thankfully, your faithful Synthetic — maybe we should call him an Android in keeping with our site? — is there to assist.</p><p>Aside from combat assistance early in the game, he'll also help guide you across the station to get from one objective to the next and hack terminals through your PDA, which handily docks into computers — so long as they have power. If you boil it down, you're essentially playing a more complicated Doom as you look for colored key cards to access different parts of the station.</p><p>But it's not all badge scanning or computer hacking. Many puzzles require you to rewire electrical panels with special tools, un-weld sealed doors, or just blast through with your assault rifle's special rounds. They're extremely satisfying, and traversal through the large station and ship is made even better by the excellent map on your interactive PDA.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jh93yyNdantC7cHu3pZwvH" name="alien-rogue-incursion-computer-interaction" alt="Gameplay from Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 showing computer interaction" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jh93yyNdantC7cHu3pZwvH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Puzzles, environment interaction, and weapon handling are among some of the game's strong suits.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Environment and tool interaction is another strong point of the game. The PDA is a touchscreen device that you'll need to physically grab and interact with as if it were a modern-day tablet. Hold it with one hand and touch the display with your fingers on the other. It feels authentic, and interacting with the many computer terminals throughout the game might be even more fun since you'll grab the joystick and use it to move a mouse cursor around the screen.</p><p>Tools all have a very satisfying tactile feel. From the pop of the torch on the welding tool to the clamp of the wrench during rewiring puzzles, every interaction feels like a veteran VR studio made it — because it did, of course. Survios has been honing these kinds of interactive systems for a decade now, and it shows.</p><p>Even the story is compelling and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I'm not the biggest Alien fan in the world, but I've seen a few of the movies and love the lore and character designs — especially the Xenomorphs. A twist about 2 hours in really shakes things up for the rest of the game, leaving me to wonder what's going to happen in Part 2 when it eventually releases.</p>
<h2 id="a-visual-downgrade-2">A visual downgrade</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5CMzNIPxG3o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<figure><blockquote><p>Quest Games Optimizer helps fix the game's visual problems, but that's a third party tool most users won't bother to try.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Of course, all of these positive feelings only go so far when the performance and visual quality of the game are as poor as they are. The game runs at 36FPS most of the time but has significant hitching when loading new areas or trying to do anything else on the Quest, like capturing a screenshot or video. If you're sensitive to low frame rate, this is <em>not</em> a game you should play.</p><p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/application-space-warp-samurai-slaughter-house-pc-vr-quest-ports">Application Space Warp</a> technology enables the game to run at a "reprojected" 72FPS, so it doesn't feel like a slow-motion action scene the whole time, but this leaves some odd visual artifacts at times. This could all be forgiven if the game's resolution were substantially higher than it was, but at least by default, it's the lowest-resolution game I've ever seen on Quest, and it dynamically scales the resolution down when performance tanks.</p><p>That means you're often left with a blurry, shimmery mess that just plain looks bad. None of these issues are surprising given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">PC and PSVR 2 reviews</a> of the game that often referred to bugs, crashes, and other visual and performance problems even after the patch that was supposed to fix them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gevXCpd9yj7xsskmydqCoH" name="alien-rogue-incursion-gunplay" alt="Gameplay from Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 shooting aliens with an assault rifle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gevXCpd9yj7xsskmydqCoH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If Survios can get the visuals fixed in an upcoming patch, it'll have delivered on the promise of a truly stunning Alien game in VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Visually, the game simply doesn't look like it should be taxing the Meta Quest 3's hardware the way it does, and games like Genotype prove that this game should look <em>and</em> run a lot better than it does. Survios also changed some visual aspects of the game's art, like adding a blue haze to the Quest version to help hide the terrible pop-in problems when the geometry is loaded.</p><p>It's clear that whatever engine Survios is using needs to be swapped out for something else. Sure, this is a game that was developed for much higher-end hardware than a Quest, but, again, there's nothing visually in the Quest version that looks like it should perform this poorly when compared to plenty of other games.</p><p>In the end, Alien: Rogue Incursion is a brilliant game wrapped in a distractingly bad visual package. If you're willing to sideload <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer">Quest Games Optimizer</a>, set the game to 120% resolution, CPU/GPU to high or ultra, and FFR to high. These settings completely fix both the resolution and performance problems at the expense of battery life, but that's why I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">great Meta Quest 3 battery head strap</a>, after all.</p><p>Hopefully, Survios will address these visual issues in a promised upcoming patch, because the rest of the game deserves to be surfaced in a better way than this.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung recently spoke about its latest "AI Innovations" with One UI 7, which also came with a warning for past-gen devices.</p><p>Seeing as the Galaxy S25 series launched with One UI 7 (Android 15), Samsung's EVP and head of the Framework R&D, Sally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/id/samsung-ungkap-rahasia-di-balik-inovasi-ux-keamanan-dan-ai-di-galaxy">was interviewed </a>(Indonesia) about its features (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-7-now-brief-not-release-older-galaxy-phones/">SamMobile</a>). While the company exec touched on the major user interface design changes and other One UI updates, one of the major highlights was its AI.</p><p>Specifically, when discussing "exclusive Galaxy S25 AI features," Sally mentioned that the software's AI is broken into two parts: hardware reliance and not.</p><p>Sally states One UI 7's "personal data engine" is a huge part of the OS, but it's a feature that utilizes on-device processing technology. It's this fact alone that forces a huge reliance on the strength of the chipset inside the phone. Sally states the personal data engine is made possible by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and its capabilities to support such rigorous on-device processing.</p><p>Sally adds features like this "really require advanced chipsets and hardware like those found on the Galaxy S25 Series."</p><p>According to Sally, "more affordable devices" will likely miss out on "deeper on-device AI experiences" like the personal data engine, which creates a more personalized AI experience for users. Moreover, Samsung states "We strive to provide the best features according to the device's capabilities and user needs."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-beta-program-2" alt="One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Sally didn't explain which features (and which past-gen phones) could lack the personal data engine. For context, the personal data engine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">was described by Samsung</a> as "Galaxy's approach to AI personalization."The engine helps protect users' data when using its on-device software. It also remains to be seen if Samsung's lock screen Now Bar/Now Brief app info will be affected by hardware limitations.</p><p>This is a selection of curated app activities for users that can help get them started in the day or help them plan. Samsung states the Now Bar is designed to be an "insightful experience" that's deeply involved in the apps you use the most.</p><p>On a related note, One UI 7's AI limitations echo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-past-gen-confirmed">what happened with Galaxy AI's</a> main functions after the Galaxy S24's launch. Many of Samsung's older Galaxy S and Galaxy Z foldables were hit with AI restrictions due to the limitations of the hardware. Devices like the Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3 were only able to receive two Galaxy AI features as their dated hardware couldn't handle much else.</p><p>We still have a ways to go until any Galaxy S device sees One UI 7, despite Samsung's confirmation that it was arriving "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">imminently</a>." However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">another beta</a> might befall the Galaxy S24 series before One UI 7 arrives officially.</p>

<ul><li>Meta-owned WhatsApp has introduced a couple of new features that make the messaging platform more colorful.</li><li>WhatsApp now has pre-set chat themes and backgrounds, which can be applied to all chats or individual chats.</li><li>The rollout of the new features has just begun on iOS and Android platforms; global roll out is expected in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ever since WhatsApp’s inception for mobile devices, the messaging platform has carried its typical green color theme throughout the app, including its chat screens. Well, that is likely to change, as the company recently announced new colorful chat bubbles and wallpapers for the app.</p><p>WhatsApp already allows users to change chat wallpapers by providing notable colors and templates. However, as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/chat-themes-to-reflect-your-style">announcement</a>, there are 30 new chat wallpapers to make the chat screen more diverse than it was before. However, the ability to choose your background from your phone’s gallery is still available.</p><p>The unique new feature aside from the wallpapers is the new chat theme option. It allows users to change the chat bubbles with relevant backgrounds — and it features some notable options to choose from. Up until now, chat bubbles were only green, and it looks like WhatsApp is catching up to the competition as they allow users to change themes, chat bubbles, and more like in Telegram, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tqeR3MUiT5jVaXtu6YZcVF" name="whatsapp-chat-theme-feature" alt="WhatsApp chat themes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqeR3MUiT5jVaXtu6YZcVF.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This means, that picking up any pre-set chat theme on WhatsApp will change both the background and chat bubble, which can further be mixed and matched to suit users’ personal preferences. Regardless of the chat theme, users can still change the background by uploading any image from their phone’s gallery.</p><p>Another notable thing to address is that these chat themes can be chat-specific or can be applied to all chats. Also, these themes are only visible to the user who set them and not to the recipient. Furthermore, a user can also change themes to their subscribed WhatsApp channels.</p><p>These new chat themes and wallpapers have just started to roll out to both iOS and Android platforms. The global availability is, however, expected in the coming weeks. Post which, a user can head to <em><strong>WhatsApp Settings> Chats> Default chat theme.</strong></em></p><p>For individual chat theme change, on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>: the user needs to open the specific chat go for the three-dot menu, and select chat theme. iOS users, on the other hand, can simply click on the chat name and look for the chat theme.</p>

<ul><li>Google is releasing the second beta of Android 16, and any supported Pixel device can run it.</li><li>The update is more substantial than the first beta, with camera and media updates.</li><li>The company is on track to release Android 16 publicly during its target of the second quarter in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is releasing the second beta of Android 16 to Pixels enrolled in the Android Beta Program starting today, Feb. 13. The update comes a few weeks after the company released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1</a> with minor changes largely indistinguishable to the average Android user. However, the just-released Android 16 Beta 2 packs a few notable new features and behavior changes, largely concerning media, camera, and graphics.</p><p>Specifically, Android 16 Beta 2 brings along features that will help improve Android cameras for professional users. It adds what Google calls a hybrid auto-exposure mode, which will let Android users employ a mix of manual and auto exposure when capturing a shot. Currently, users have to choose between full manual or full auto shooting modes on Android. With Android 16 Beta 2, they can control ISO or exposure time and use auto-exposure algorithms simultaneously.</p><p>The update also introduces support for fine color temperature and tint adjustments. There are only a few preset color temperature modification options currently available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, but Android 16 Beta 2 further adds "precise adjustments of white balance based on the correlated color temperature," according to Google.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Beta 2</a> has intent actions for motion photos — a combination of still images and short videos with audio — that developers can use. Developers can also determine exactly where the motion photo will be saved.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.92%;"><img id="mwuUGnzgcZh2AhjZMVW2cS" name="Google-HDR-Android-16" alt="Google is bringing UltraHDR support to HEIC-formatted images with Android 16 Beta 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwuUGnzgcZh2AhjZMVW2cS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="712" height="626" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google is bringing UltraHDR support to HEIC-formatted images with Android 16 Beta 2. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That rounds out the camera changes, but Google is also improving image processing with Android 16 Beta 2. It's gaining support for UltraHDR photos formatted in HEIC, which is a lightweight and efficient file format. Eventually, Google is working on adding support for AVIF formatting for UltraHDR photos, too.</p><p>Android 16 Beta 2 features a few developer-focused behavior changes, like the removal of Android's edge-to-edge opt-out for apps, new Android health permissions, and intent redirect changes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1442px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.88%;"><img id="FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY" name="Android-16-Release-Schedule" alt="The beta release schedule for Android 16." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRfBGrdxWjywWPxsmbYsAY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1442" height="330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 16 Beta 2's release confirms Google is on track to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">meet its new Android release schedule</a>. The operating system is reaching platform stability, which should occur next month. Android 16 will then be shipped publicly in the second quarter of 2025.</p><p>You can try out Android 16 Beta 2 by enrolling a supported Google Pixel phone — Pixel 6 series and newer — in the Android Beta Program <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">here</a>. From here on, the device will receive over-the-air (OTA) updates for future betas.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is in the rear mirror,  the company is focusing on its non-flagship devices, which are probably going to launch soon, and new renders of the devices have now surfaced again — thanks to Evan Blass.</p><p>In a couple of shared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/p/ff1cba6c-fbc6-44b1-83e6-56116fdb8e23">Substack email links</a>, Blass has shared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/p/dc4dbc5e-ee98-469f-9ae9-5349cd9fe474">new renders</a> of the upcoming Galaxy A56 and A36 devices, which give us a clear picture of what to expect from Samsung’s next mid-range devices — in terms of design. Per the new renders, both share identical designs featuring squared-off edges and rounded corners.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.51%;"><img id="RZLb4N3u59nsKVxDeU8sE9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A56-render-leak" alt="Galaxy A56 render leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RZLb4N3u59nsKVxDeU8sE9.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="338" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>They also come with the new Key Island design aesthetic that includes a raised bar on the right pane, which features the handset’s power button and volume rockers. The new design element was first ventured with the predecessor models dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55 and A35</a> and was later carried to budget Galaxy models like the Galaxy A15 and A25 — back in 2023.</p><p>Going by last year’s models’ release date, the launch of the Galaxy A56 and A36 should likely be happening in the first week of March, which is a couple of weeks away. According to renders by Blass, the former could be coming in shades of pink, gray, and green, and the latter also in shades of gray, green, and possibly purple.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.51%;"><img id="95Pg5rYeQ6tvLqJ9igJDc8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A36-render-leak" alt="Galaxy A36 render leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95Pg5rYeQ6tvLqJ9igJDc8.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="338" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest renders also corroborate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a56-renders-leak">earlier leak</a> from November 2024, wherein we got to see the Galaxy A56 also in the pink shade. The device will have a triple camera array bundled together in a single camera visor, unlike the predecessor, which featured individual three cameras.</p><p>Like the recent Galaxy models, we should also be expecting new black camera covers on top of the actual lenses, a notable change, which was also seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>As for the expected specs, very little is known about the Galaxy A56, which is rumored to carry an Exynos 1580 SoC underneath and likely has support for 45W charging for the first time, similar to the flagship series, despite being a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Additional information has supposedly come to light regarding Samsung's next Z Fold model.</p><p>A source from South Korean publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/13/latest-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-reiterate-thinner-design-bigger-screen-and-a-big-s-pen-change/">EtNews</a> claims Samsung is moving toward several hardware and S Pen changes for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/13/latest-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-reiterate-thinner-design-bigger-screen-and-a-big-s-pen-change/">9to5Google</a>). The post states the next Fold will feature a "larger display size" for its internal and external displays. The Fold 7 is rumored to sport an 8-inch and 6.5-inch screen, respectively. Curiously, the publication's sources suggest that the bigger screens will "make it easier" to reduce the thickness of the next foldable.</p><p>That's where the next portion of rumors come in as Samsung is — once again — reportedly ditching the S Pen digitizer.</p><p>The publication cites "multiple industry insiders," stating, "It has been decided that the digitizer will not be applied to the Fold 7." The purported changes don't appear to be drastic, as Samsung is allegedly looking to dip below 10mm in thickness for the Fold 7. Specifically, the post claims that removing the S Pen's digitizer could offer a (rough) 0.6mm reduction.</p><p>Samsung is also rumored to be looking at new ways of providing S Pen functions. The Korean OEM is allegedly looking at turning the S Pen into its own device that requires a battery to support its core functions.</p>

<p>A lot of what we're hearing today doubles down on previous rumors, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">ones from mid-January</a>. A YouTube report by a South Korean publication claimed that Samsung was looking at removing the digitizer for the S Pen, meaning it won't be stored within the phone. It's a change that would mirror what the company did with the Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Fold 6 Special Edition</a>.</p><p>Without a digitizer, consumers would have to charge their S Pen since the device won't do so internally. This could cause the stylus to end up slightly larger and maybe a little bulkier than we're used to. Also, rumors from December add that Samsung could chase AES technology so the stylus could manage everything on its own without reliance on the Fold 7.</p><p>Rumors about the phone's displays continue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">doubling down on</a> two-month-old speculation. Tipsters on social media claimed Samsung could deliver an 8-inch main display and a 6.5-inch cover screen for the Fold 7. Those rumors touched on the FLip 7, too, stating it could feature a 6.85-inch foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen.</p><p>The Fold 7 is expected to debut later this year, likely sometime during the summer as usual.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Word on the streets is that Samsung's planning to launch a 'G Fold' multi-fold phone, also known as the "double-folding" foldable. This would expand the brand's current Galaxy Z family, going from a duo to a trio of diverse foldable form factors. Hurray for innovation, right? Well, based on rumors and alleged leaks from the weeks past, this seems counterproductive.</p><p>In case you haven't heard already, purported reports about Samsung's foldable sales and production numbers started surfacing around late December 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-ultra-just-broke-new-ground-for-android-flagships">Galaxy S24 Ultra might be breaking records</a>, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 are headed in the opposite direction. Apparently, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 series sales</a> did not live up to the Korean smartphone maker's expectations. Based on this decline, Samsung is supposedly cutting down on production for the Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 series.</p><p>An alleged reduction of roughly three million foldable units produced is no small feat. This doesn't bode well for Samsung's slice of the foldable market at all, especially when taking their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">original target of a 10% <em>increase</em></a> into account. And yet, the brand all but confirmed the multi-folding G Fold device at Galaxy Unpacked 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't the first time that Samsung has shown off its conceptual multi-fold phone. In fact, prototypes of the book-like Android device were shown off at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. What I am highly skeptical of at the moment isn't the existence of the device but rather the alleged release timeline.</p><p>If the rumors are true and Samsung launches the G Fold in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">second quarter of 2025</a>, there will be three Galaxy foldables launching this year and around the same time. Furthermore, the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> likely will not be very different from their predecessors, as other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-to-carry-z-fold-edition-features">leaks have pointed out</a>. In that case, it is highly likely that the downward trend in their sales will continue.</p><p>Even with scaled-back Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 production, Samsung will then have the G Fold to consider. If people are losing interest in these expensive Android devices, who's to say the multi-fold will sell well? Sure, it'll garner interest from hobbyists and enthusiasts, but the exorbitant price tag will likely prevent many of them from actually buying one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not like the larger, more innovative, and experimental G Fold multi-fold phone can be expected to launch with a cheaper price tag either. After all, new technology is expensive. The first few years of sales alone are sometimes not enough to recuperate research and development costs.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy G Fold will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">reportedly use Samsung Display's "newly developed display and film,"</a> which will be debuted at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona next month. Some tipsters have suggested that the G Fold launch could be delayed past Q2 2025 into Samsung's fall Unpacked event.</p><p>According to more hearsay, Samsung is only gunning for about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">200,000 units of the multi-fold phone</a>, playing it safe rather than taking a bold risk.</p><p>Samsung is starting to realize that its current portfolio of foldables has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">become very stale</a>. This is very clearly reflected in the numbers. Regardless of Samsung's hopes for the multi-fold, I don't think it will be enough to revive foldable sales.</p><p>At the end of the day, it'll all boil down to the price of the G Fold. Because, let's be honest — if the G Fold is priced anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT tri-foldable</a>, no one's going to buy it.</p>
