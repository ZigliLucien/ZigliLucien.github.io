Go pick up a TicWatch Pro 5 before the sale ends on March 25th and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYS4KJV6"><strong>you&apos;ll save an outstanding 35%</strong></a> on your purchase, a discount that returns the watch to its lowest price <em>ever</em>. </p>

<p>The TicWatch Pro 5 is great for folks who love a big smartwatch, with a reliable Snapdragon processor, up to 80 hours of battery life, and a comprehensive suite of reliable health and fitness tracking technology. You also get the popular Essential Mode feature to conserve battery life and a Gorilla Glass construction with 5ATM/IP68 protection, basically ensuring that this watch will keep on ticking no matter where you are. </p>
<p>Pick up the TicWatch Pro 5 during the Amazon Big Spring Sale and you'll get a straight 35% off. That's the biggest discount that the smartwatch has ever received from the retailer!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYS4KJV6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="75a8f34d-6320-4281-aaab-bb04fc4b8b71" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349.99" data-dimension48="$349.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want a big smartwatch with military-grade durability and outstanding battery life. </p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if: </strong>you have small wrists; you want Google Assistant or the latest Wear OS updates. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the TicWatch Pro 5 is "a beast of a smartwatch", combining excellent Wear OS performance with a clever design and battery life to stunning effect. There&apos;s a rotating crown with haptic feedback that is simply a joy to use, and the Pro&apos;s "Essential Mode" means that you&apos;ll still be able to utilize the watch&apos;s basic functions when it&apos;s low on juice. That feature alone could have earned the TicWatch Pro 5 a spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, but the bulky frame and lack of Wear OS 4 integration have given us considerable pause.</p><p>Still, if you&apos;d like a larger watch with multiple days of battery life and all of the software features you could ever need, the TicWatch Pro 5 is a great choice, especially when you pair it with a massive 35% discount.</p>

Instant Plays is still in a "limited" beta with a few select games for those in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Moreover, the Korean OEM states its mobile game streaming hub supports native Android APKs, existing in-game monetization models for gaming publishers, and cloud-based solutions for developers.</p><p>The hub&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/gaming-hub/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">official page</a> details familiar features, such as the ability to manage downloaded games, alerts for exclusive gaming perks, and coupons.</p><p>Samsung discussed furthering its ambitions in streaming mobile games for Galaxy users at the Gaming Developer Conference (GDC 2024). The company&apos;s corporate vice president, Jikhan Jung, stated, " Our vision for Gaming Hub for mobile is to provide an all-in-one gaming platform optimized for Galaxy owners that makes playing and discovering games much easier without downloading and waiting."</p>

<p>Samsung first announced its original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub">Gaming Hub</a> for larger displays during CES 2022. The game-streaming discovery platform for smart TVs and more supports Xbox, GeForce Now, Utomik, and Amazon Luna. Users can seamlessly connect a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gaming-hub#:~:text=SAMSUNG%20GAMING%20HUB%3A-,SUPPORTED%20CONTROLLERS,-(Image%20credit%3A%20Nicholas">supported gaming controller</a> to stream popular games to their TVs without needing a console.</p><p>While this may not be mentioned, Galaxy users who are hopping into the Gaming Hub should still find controller support.</p><p>Samsung didn&apos;t specifically list anything new arriving for its Gaming Hub for mobile rebrand. However, the hub notably piggybacks off some AI gaming software for curated recommendations on its home screen. Perhaps there&apos;s more in store as the company continues to "innovate" on its game-streaming platform.</p>

<ul><li>A recent Google Keep version shows the company's plans to introduce a revamped toolbar to the app.</li><li>The floating, pill-shaped toolbar takes up less space and offers users three options: create a note, a list, and a drawing or picture note.</li><li>While the new toolbar takes up much less space, it will also remove a couple of options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s notetaking app, Keep, has started a test involving a redesigned bottom bar for users.</p><p>As detailed by AssembleDeBug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Google-Keep-New-Bottom-Toolbar.html">TheSpAndroid</a>), Google is seemingly dropping the bottom UI toolbar in Keep in favor of a floating, pill-shaped alternative (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/google-keep-floating-bottom-bar/">9to5Google</a>). The latest test was discovered in Keep&apos;s recent 5.24.102 version. Surfacing the bar in Keep&apos;s code on Android showcased the new bar&apos;s three options: open a new note, create a list, and create a drawing or picture note.</p><p>This toolbar supposedly utilizes your Android phone&apos;s Dynamic Theme, meaning it will feature your desired color palette. The deep dive also showed that the plus icon for starting a new note features a neat animation when tapped.</p><p>While the new bar could be seen as a way of taking up less space on your display, Google has removed a couple of options alongside that. AssembleDeBug noted that the floating bar no longer contains options for voice notes, nor is there a dedicated photo button.</p><p>It&apos;s speculated that Google has popped both options inside the additional options menu (plus icon) when in a newly created note. The pill-shaped bar notably affects Keep in Landscape mode, as the test shows users should experience more content and less toolbar obstruction</p>

<p>Google went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">down a similar road</a> with its messaging app Chat last November. The company rolled out a UI redesign for the app, revamping it with a floating, pill-shaped toolbar with several shortcuts. Users were able to quickly dive into their home panel, direct messages, spaces, and mentions.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is the second test Google has been spotted working on for Keep in recent times, with the first involving AI. In February, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">started a test</a> to bring Gemini-powered features to Keep in the form of a "Help me create a list" feature. Similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help me write</a>," Keep&apos;s version is said to assist users in creating lists for shopping, things to do, and packing.</p><p>The app&apos;s code showed that users will eventually find a floating "help me create a list" button at the bottom of a new note. Users can then write a prompt detailing what they&apos;d like the AI bot to do. While it was suggested that users give "more specifics" to help the AI, personal information should be kept out of it.</p>

<ul><li>Information has leaked about which cores MediaTek could pack into its upcoming Dimensity 9400 flagship SoC.</li><li>Rumors suggest it could offer Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores, but its exact CPU layout is still unknown.</li><li>Previous rumors detailed its early benchmark scores, which saw MediaTek's chip beat Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 in one of the two tests.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information on MediaTek&apos;s upcoming response to Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 has leaked, showing us how the competition might shake down.</p><p>According to Digital Chat Station (DCS) on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O637drBmr">Weibo</a>, MediaTek&apos;s next flagship SoC may feature Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/dimensity-9400-could-give-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-a-hard-time-as-more-details-about-the-chipset-surface/">WCCFtech</a>). DCS didn&apos;t go into detail about the chip&apos;s CPU layout, though there is some speculation.</p><p>The publication suggests the Dimensity 9400 could feature five X5 cores, three X4 cores, and four A7xx cores. We&apos;re still left wondering what speeds the Dimensity 9400 could clock in at.</p><p>The Weibo post concluded with rumors about MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC. DCS states the chip could offer a "super-large" Cortex-X4 at 3.4GHz. The chip may also launch in May.</p><p>If the rumors are true, it seems as though MediaTek is ditching the idea of efficiency cores for its flagship Soc — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">like last year</a>. However, the chip could offer further leaps over its predecessor, considering the speculation behind the inclusion of X5 cores. The Dimensity 9300 delivered four Arm Cortex-X4 cores and four Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>Previous rumors about the upcoming flagship chip suggest it will be built off a 3nm process instead of the last-gen&apos;s 4nm process. Moreover, early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-early-benchmarks">leaked benchmark results</a> suggest it could outperform Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. It was rumored in February that the Dimensity 9400 achieved a 2776 score on the single-core test and a score of 11,739 on the multicore test.</p><p>It&apos;s wise to take these results with caution until we know officially during the chip&apos;s official launch. Qualcomm&apos;s chip is expected to debut featuring its stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Oryon cores</a>, so that&apos;s another aspect to be aware of.</p><p>Meanwhile, MediaTek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-optimizes-dimensity-chips-for-gemini-nano">recently optimized</a> their Dimensity 9300 and 8300 chips for Gemini Nano&apos;s capabilities in conjunction with Google. While the former was designed with generative AI in mind, further tuning ensured Google&apos;s latest AI model could work seamlessly on devices with the previously mentioned chips.</p><p>Considering this, perhaps we can expect more AI influence in MediaTek&apos;s upcoming reveal. The company isn&apos;t expected to debut its Dimensity 9400 chip until later this year, potentially in October.</p>

<hr>
<p>After years of holding out, Samsung may have finally joined the seamless update party.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.themobileindian.com/news/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a55-5g-1st-samsung-phone-to-get-seamless-updates" target="_blank">The Mobile Indian</a>, the Galaxy A55 has become the first Samsung phone to receive a seamless Android update with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/second-galaxy-s24-software-update-is-out">latest March 2024 patch</a>. With this change, Samsung has introduced a split progress bar to show that the update is going on seamlessly.</p><p>Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman chimed in and shared some insights on X (formerly Twitter), noting that those who own Samsung&apos;s newest mid-range model are noticing this feature.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung may have finally implemented seamless updates on their Android devices! When updating the new Galaxy A55 5G, users have noticed that the software update screen now shows a "downloading and installing" as well as "verification" steps. In addition, @TheMobileIndian… pic.twitter.com/3Xk8iQZ3gz<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1770827713567158730">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>After checking out the software update screen, users noticed two stages of installation: the "downloading and installing" phase and the "verification" phase.</p><p>This means that you won&apos;t have to wait for ages as your phone installs system updates anymore. Your device will quietly install the update in the background, and all you&apos;ll need to do is restart your phone to apply it. It&apos;s a bit like what Google&apos;s been doing with its Pixels since the very first model.</p><p>Normally, when you download and install an update on a Samsung device, you need to restart your phone to finish it. And while that&apos;s happening, you&apos;re stuck not being able to use your device until it&apos;s all sorted.</p><p>However, it looks like some Galaxy A55 users were able to keep using their phones while the update was downloaded quietly in the background.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s adoption of seamless updates is not entirely a surprise. Back in 2022, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-working-on-seamless-updates-one-ui-6">Samsung executive spilled the beans</a> and confirmed that the company was cooking up plans to roll out seamless updates. It now looks like the company has finally made it happen.</p><p>What&apos;s really interesting is that Samsung decided to debut this feature on one of its mid-range phones instead of saving it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Galaxy models</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>While it looks like seamless updates are up and running on the Galaxy A55 now, Samsung hasn&apos;t rolled out this feature to all its devices just yet. However, there&apos;s a chance the South Korean tech giant might introduce it to other models through future updates.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S DOJ is accusing Apple of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market by not incorporating cross-platform services so that consumers continue to depend on their expensive devices</li><li>The lawsuit targets Apple's most-priced possessions, the iPhone and the Apple Watch </li><li>The 'anti-trust' lawsuit claims that Apple takes advantage of its dominant ecosystem and monopoly power to push its expensive products onto customers</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Apple on Thursday (Mar 21) for monopolizing the smartphone market. The DOJ, along with 16 other district attorneys, is suing the tech giant for its "anti-competitive practices." </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/9765671b79f64ad9/6cfe3c6c-full.pdf">antitrust lawsuit</a> claims that Apple takes advantage of its dominant ecosystem and monopoly power to extract more money from consumers, developers, and others.  </p><p>The DOJ says that the company has always known that this kind of dominance has been threatened by other factors, such as innovative products and apps. And instead of responding to these competitive threats by lowering the prices of its products for consumers, Apple has always wriggled its way out by imposing a series of "shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines."</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/doj-sues-apple-over-iphone-monopoly.html">CNBC</a>, The Justice Department said in a release that, to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple blocked cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility, and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.</p><p>"This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple&apos;s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future," the DOJ stated.</p>

<p>The complaint states that Apple protects its smartphone monopoly by degrading and undermining cross-platform messaging apps and rival smartphones. For ages, Apple has limited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-apple-imessage-gatekeeper-ruling">cross-platform messaging</a>, forcing people to use only Apple devices to communicate effectively and with one another. "Apple undermines cross-platform messaging to reinforce obstacle [s]to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones," the lawsuit states.</p><p>Apple could have made better cross-platform messaging more inclusive by allowing iMessage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>, but the tech giant made people believe that doing so would hurt consumers more than help them. In 2013, Apple&apos;s SVP of software engineering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-considered-bringing-imessage-android-but-chose-not">explained</a> that supporting cross-platform OTT messaging in Apple Messages "would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones."</p><p>The company has since agreed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">support RCS messaging</a> on its platform later this year, although we still don&apos;t know the exact details about how this will be implemented. </p>

<p>The DOJ has also discussed the Apple Watch&apos;s incompatibility with Android devices and the limited capabilities of third-party smartwatches with the iPhone. The complaint alleges that "users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones."</p><p>The vice president of product marketing for the Apple Watch acknowledged that the smartwatch may help prevent iPhone users from switching to Android devices and continue to help them monopolize the market. According to the complaint, many surveys have reached similar conclusions: users say that the additional accessories linked to their iPhones are the reason they do not switch to Android.</p><p>The complaint also addresses how Apple has been restricting developers from offering cloud gaming apps to reduce dependence on the iPhone&apos;s expensive hardware.</p><p>Cloud streaming game apps let users run computationally intensive games without having to process or store them on their smartphones. This allows developers to bring technologies and services to smartphone consumers, including gaming and interactive artificial intelligence.</p><p>The lawsuit cites an Apple manager who complained that "all that matters is who has the cheapest hardware and consumers could buy a [expletive] Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and have a solid cloud computing device that works fine."</p>

<p>The case is being filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, DOJ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Apple has maintained "a chokehold on competition" and "smothered an entire industry" through its shift from "revolutionizing the smartphone market to stalling its advancement." </p><p>According to the New York Times, Apple has defended itself against other antitrust challenges by arguing that its policies are critical to making its devices private and secure. </p><p>The lawsuit could force Apple to embrace cross-platform collaboration finally. According to Ted Miracco, CEO,<strong> </strong>Approov<strong>,</strong> the Department of Justice, the EU, and the UK are all pursuing antitrust actions against Apple, highlighting that Apple&apos;s idea that it alone can provide security for the mobile ecosystem is unrealistic.</p>
<p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107784/apples-response-to-the-dojs-iphone-antitrust-lawsuit">The Verge</a>, Apple responded to the lawsuit, stating that it threatened its identity and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.</p><p>"At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love—designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets."</p><p>"If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering the government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it."</p>

You might be in luck with the Amazon Spring Sale! Until the end of this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WTGSGY1"><strong>Amazon has cut $100 off the price of the Garmin Forerunner 955</strong></a>, our favorite watch for runners. This brings the price down by 20% overall, back down to its lowest price ever. We especially love this GPS smartwatch for runners or cyclists, featuring real-time stamina and training readiness tracking, accurate GNSS data, and a handful of useful sports modes.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that this Amazon deal is specifically for the non-solar version of the watch, though it still offers up to 15 days of battery life in smartwatch mode or up to 42 hours in GPS mode.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Garmin Forerunner 955 is our favorite watch for runners</a>, offering a long battery life, super-accurate GNSS tracking, a touchscreen, and full-color mapping. With several unique sports modes to choose from and access to real-time training readiness and stamina data, there's more than one reason why buyers like it so much.</p>
<p>This deal isn't for the solar version of the watch, though some prefer the cheaper, non-solar version anyway since it still offers a substantial battery life.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for something with ultra-accurate GNSS tracking; you want a smartwatch that includes full-color mapping features and a touchscreen; battery life is a major selling point for your needs. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re sensitive to watches with overly thick designs;<strong> </strong>you&apos;re specifically looking for a smartwatch with solar, or you want the solar version of the Forerunner 955.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 955 is a great smartwatch pick for fitness enthusiasts like runners and cyclists, offering highly accurate GPS data, sports modes, real-time stamina tracking, and more. Despite not being the solar configuration, this smartwatch still has up to 15 days of battery life with the use of variable modes, and it comes with full-color mapping that outdoor enthusiasts love.</p><p>It&apos;s still not quite as cheap as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Garmin Forerunner 255</a> even with the deal, though for the extra maps feature and touchscreen, the price cut makes the upgrade version seem well worth the price.</p>

<p>We called the Google Pixel 8 Pro the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy in 2023, and it’s not hard to see why. For several years now, Google has produced flagship phones that expertly balance premium specs and cutting-edge features with good old-fashioned bang for the buck, and the Pixel 8 Pro is no exception.</p><p>The phone ships with Google’s very own Tensor G3 chipset, an ultra-efficient processor that handily powers the phone&apos;s AI-powered camera features, and supports both sub-6 and mmWave. This phone also works with Wi-Fi 6E so it can make the most of modern 6GHz-enabled routers.  If you’re looking for a phone that will work great on just about any carrier’s 5G network, the Pixel 8 Pro is a great place to start.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that the aforementioned camera software found on the Pixel 8 Pro is just about the best we’ve ever used, with features like Photo Unblur and four modes of video stabilization along with new features like Best Take, Magic Editor, and even Audio Magic Eraser for videos. As we note in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro review</a>, the phone also boasts a stunning 1-120Hz AMOLED display, excellent battery life with wireless charging capabilities, and the bloat-free power of Android 14.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who likes to play everything from Fortnite to Genshin Impact on their phone without compromising on framerates or quality, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is exactly what you’re looking for. It can keep games locked at 60 FPS and running buttery smooth all without making you feel like you’re holding a hot brick.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra pairs the super-efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, with a large 5,000mAh battery to deliver outstanding performance, whether you’re gaming, streaming, or surfing the web. You still get the vibrant 6.8-inch AMOLED  display with an integrated stylus, plus the robust camera system with a 200MP resolution main camera.</p><p>As we noted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">our Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra review</a>, the phone is also set to receive updates for the next seven years, which is probably longer than you&apos;d typically be using it for. Usually retailing for well over a $1,000, the S24 Ultra is far from cheap, but if you want the most powerful 5G phone that money can buy in 2024, this is it.</p>

<p>With a starting price of just under $500, the OnePlus 12R gets you a flagship processor, premium design and build quality, a brilliant AMOLED display, and the quickest charging ever in this segment.</p><p>The 12R is the first in OnePlus&apos; R series of phones to finally get a US launch. These phones are typically known for their aggressive specs and low price. We&apos;re talking Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display, and 100W wired charging. If that&apos;s not enough to get you excited, the 12R follows the same design as the flagship 12.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">our review</a>, we simply loved how the 12R felt every bit as powerful as the OnePlus 12. The main camera really stood out, delivering flagship-grade performance in daylight and low light. The software is slick and fluid, and the 12R is slated to get three Android OS upgrades. Overall, there&apos;s very little to be disappointed about, especially when you consider how much you&apos;re paying.</p>

<p>The Pixel 7a offers some truly outstanding bang for the buck, thanks to specs like the Google Tensor G2 chipset (the same processor found in the more-expensive Pixel 7 Pro), superb haptics, and camera tech that rivals much more expensive Android phones. In fact, we found that the Pixel 7a performed just as well as the base model Pixel 7 in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">our review</a>.</p><p>You also get Android 13 (upgradeable to 14) with all of the usual Pixel-exclusive features straight out of the box, plus five years of Pixel updates guaranteed. The phone also offers an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and it looks slim and stylish, and sports a punchy 6.1-inch AMOLED display with support for HDR playback.</p><p>The 7a is available in Charcoal, Snow, and Sea Coral colors, which looks stylish and cool. The 4,385mAh built-in battery offers decent battery life, and you even get wireless charging support up to 7.5W. The cameras are probably the main reason to get this though, as this phone captures truly stunning images and videos.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is not as intimidating as the more expensive Galaxy Z Fold, which makes it a good balance for someone looking to enter the world of foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> is perhaps this phone&apos;s biggest rival, but between the two, we&apos;d advise picking the Galaxy for its more robust software update history, and better performance.</p><p>Part of the phone’s novelty also lies in its cover screen. The larger and more functional display lets you view notifications without having to open your phone, and reply to messages. You also get customizable widgets for the usual standards such as weather and alarms. The Z Flip 5 is incredibly pocketable when closed, making it very easy to carry in your pocket or a little handbag. One of the main praises <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">in our review</a> was its 6.7-inch AMOLED screen, which offered good levels of brightness and gorgeous color vibrancy.</p><p>The Z Flip 5 is also aesthetically pleasing as it comes in flashy Mint, Graphite, Cream, and Lavender colors, and Samsung has some funky first-party accessories for it too. Overall, this foldable offers a lot of functional value and is available with all the main 5G carriers in the US.</p>

<p>The Phone 2a is Nothing&apos;s first-ever budget smartphone, and it carries the same quirky DNA as its pricier siblings. It features a transparent back panel, has meticulous attention to detail, and the Glyph lights on the back are some of the unique features.</p><p>The Phone 2a has a large 5,000mAh battery with relatively quick charging. The camera specs on paper are also quite good, and from what we&apos;ve tested so far, they perform very well compared to the other phones of its class. The only catch with the Phone 2a is that you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-why-nothing-isnt-launching-the-phone-2a-in-the-us">can&apos;t buy it outright</a> in the US. However,  you can try your luck getting it via Nothing&apos;s developer program from its website for $349.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-questions-answered">brief time</a> using the phone, we&apos;re already mighty impressed at what the company has pulled off here. You get fewer LEDs around the camera module for the Glyph lights, but the functionality is still solid. The 6.7-inch AMOLED display is pretty to look at, and colors and brightness levels are satisfactory. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro SoC, which is more than adequate for casual use. Overall, you get all the main quality-of-life features, reliable performance, and good 5G connectivity at a fantastic price.</p>

<p>5G coverage is widespread in the US, and you&apos;ll find good network coverage from all the major carriers. In order to take full advantage of this, all of them have phased out 4G phones with all 5G models, across the price range. Whether you&apos;re getting your next phone through your carrier or simply buying it unlocked, it&apos;s important to have a good 5G smartphone to benefit from fast data connectivity.</p><p>The Pixel 8 Pro is an excellent all-round option as it balances price and features beautifully. You&apos;ll also be getting Android updates straight from Google, so your device will be the first to get new features and patches. On a similar note, we&apos;ve chosen the Pixel 7a as our best mid-range offering, as it has flagship-level features, the same priority attention from Google for updates, brilliant cameras, and is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> you&apos;ll find.</p><p>If you want the best network speeds and you can afford the $1,000+ price tag, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is a clear winner, thanks to its impressive hardware design and support for 5G on every carrier. Samsung&apos;s commitment to software updates also helps buyers feel confident that they&apos;ll be able to use this phone for years to come. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 is our pick for the best 5G folding phone. It&apos;s easier to live with as it&apos;s more compact than the Z Fold 5, and cheaper as well. </p><p>If you don&apos;t mind shopping outside your carrier&apos;s portfolio for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">best unlocked phone</a>, the OnePlus 12R is an excellent value proposition. You get exceptional performance, a superb main camera, a premium design, and 100W wired charging which is hard to beat at its price. Another great budget option that you should get (if you can) is the Nothing Phone 2a. It punches well above its weight, has all the current features that you&apos;d need, and flaunts a design that&apos;s from the future. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google has released another sneak peek of Android 15 for developers. The latest release introduces better ways to chat even when your signal&apos;s weak, support for apps on the tiny screens of flippable phones, and more.</p><p>Android 15 Developer Preview 2 gives us another build before the big open beta in April. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Just like last time</a>, this update focuses more on making sure apps run smoothly and play nice with the system rather than piling on new features. Google has also been working on tightening up privacy, security, and the overall user experience.</p><p>This developer preview of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is mainly for app makers preparing for the next big Android release, which will probably drop in the fall. But even if you&apos;re not a developer, it&apos;s a neat peek into what&apos;s coming up.</p><p>The big news from the update is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-pixel-feature-spotted">satellite connectivity everyone&apos;s been talking about</a>. Google says it wants to make sure you stay connected no matter where you are. Plus, it&apos;s jazzing up the tap-to-pay experience with NFC readers, making it smoother and more reliable.</p><p>In Android 15, apps will be able to tell when your device is hooked up to a satellite, so they&apos;ll understand why you might not have full network access. Plus, SMS/MMS and RCS apps can now use satellite connections to send and receive messages.</p>

<p>Google is not just stopping at connectivity upgrades—it&apos;s also improving app performance and the media experience in Android 15. The company is giving developers some handy tools to make their apps run smoother and faster, with APIs that dish out information to fine-tune app startup, speed up slow tasks, and pinpoint performance hiccups.</p><p>Android 15 Developer Preview 2 also includes some serious upgrades to the PdfRenderer APIs. This means apps will have the ability to handle password-protected files, add annotations, incorporate form editing, support searching, and integrate selection with copy.</p><p>In Android 14, Google introduced a feature that allowed your phone to recognize multiple languages for audio and switch between them automatically. However, this sometimes led to words getting lost, especially when languages switched quickly. Now, in Android 15, Google is giving apps more control to fine-tune this language switching, making sure it works smoother for different situations.</p><p>Google has also got developers&apos; backs when it comes to large screens, flippables, and foldables. That&apos;s why Android 15 is stepping up to the plate, offering support for apps on the small cover screens of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">favorite foldable phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> or Motorola Razr. The goal is to give apps more flexibility to adapt and show up right, no matter what kind of device you&apos;re using.</p><p>In the privacy and security department, the new preview version brings in screen recorder detection. This means developers can now set up a callback to make the screen invisible while someone&apos;s recording it.</p><p>These releases are just for developers to play around with. They&apos;re meant to test out new features and make sure apps run smoothly on the latest devices, so expect bugs and other hiccups along the way.</p><p>Google will listen closely to developers&apos; feedback as they fine-tune Android 15 over the next few months. So, if you&apos;re okay with the occasional hiccup, go ahead and give it a spin.</p>
