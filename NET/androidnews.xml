<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Seven new models have been added to Motorola's Android 15 lineup, including the Motorola Razr 50s, Edge 40, and ThinkPhone 25.</li><li>Despite the expanded list, Motorola‚Äôs slow update history and lack of a clear timeline may leave users waiting longer.</li><li>The initial October list had 23 devices, including the Razr+ (2024) and Edge 30 Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has been gearing up to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its smartphone lineup, and a new report indicates the company is adding more devices to the update list, making the rollout even bigger.</p><p>The company hasn‚Äôt officially shared its Android 15 roadmap yet, but updated support pages are quietly revealing which of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">beloved Motorola phones</a> will get the upgrade. Seven more devices just made the cut, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/11/15/motorola-confirms-android-15-for-more-devices-complete-list/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>.</p><p>The additional handsets getting the Android 15 update include:</p>
<ul><li>Motorola Razr 50s</li><li>Motorola Razr 40s</li><li>Motorola Edge (2023)</li><li>Motorola Edge 40</li><li>Motorola Edge 40 Neo</li><li>Motorola Edge 30 Ultra</li><li>Motorola ThinkPhone 25</li></ul>
<p>Motorola‚Äôs support pages have offered a glimpse of its Android 15 plans. Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">October‚Äôs initial list</a>, more models have been added, showing Motorola‚Äôs commitment to keeping its devices current.</p><p>The previous list featured 23 phones set for the update, including flagship models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Moto Razr+ (2024)</a>, the standard Razr (2024), and the latest Edge devices. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion was also set to get the update.</p><p>Motorola‚Äôs broader Android 15 rollout is a win, but without a solid timeline and the company's history of slow updates, users might be in for a wait before enjoying the new OS.</p><p>Currently, Android 15 is still in the early stages, with supported Pixel devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-first-oem-to-drop-android-15-updates-is-one-youd-never-guess">some Vivo phones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-is-rolling-out-to-the-oneplus-pad-2-this-week-heres-whats-new">and the new OnePlus Pad 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> series getting the update first. Samsung‚Äôs beta release for One UI 7 is expected soon, so it‚Äôs likely Motorola will speed up its Android 15 rollout.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A leak of Samsung‚Äôs next budget phone, the Galaxy A26, fully reveals the device's design.</li><li>It will sport an Infinity-U display, likely measuring 6.64 inches, and includes notable bezels with a large chin.</li><li>The sub-$300 phone is expected to carry a ‚ÄúKey Island‚Äù design again and be powered by Exynos 1280 SoC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we wait for the next flagship Galaxy S25 series early next year, Samsung has a history of releasing its budget phones towards the end of the year to kick things off. These come under the Galaxy A series, and a new leak reveals what to expect from the Galaxy A26 budget phone.</p><p>Tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer, widely known as OnLeaks, has provided CAD-based renders of the Galaxy A26 in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/topic/samsung-galaxy-a26">Android Headlines</a>. The renders showcase the device from all angles, and it largely looks similar to the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-galaxy-a25-launch">Galaxy A25</a>, which comprises a compact form factor. The device is expected to come with a flat display with an old-school water drop notch and flatter sides.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Here comes your very first look at the #Samsung #GalaxyA26 (360¬∞ video + gorgeous 5K renders + dimensions)! üòèOn behalf of @Androidheadline üëâüèª https://t.co/5aeKJuYJdp pic.twitter.com/xXnj59lOgV<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857117722426970395">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Since it caters to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">budget Android phone</a> segment of Samsung's lineup, it evidently has significant bezels, with a sizable chin at the bottom. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy A26 will possibly again feature a ‚ÄúKey Island‚Äù ‚Äî an area where volume rockers and power button protrude a bit from the side frame to make users easily spot them instead of lying them flat on the frame.</p><p>The publication also shared other expected specifications, including a 6.64-inch display and the device that will probably measure 164 x 77.5 x 7.7mm (9.7mm with the camera bump. One difference we notice is the camera housing, which is now a singular bar placed vertically on one corner of the phone. This is a change from the current design language, which features three individually-placed camera sensors in a row.</p>

<p>The upcoming Galaxy A26 is believed to be powered by an Exynos 1280 chipset and paired with at least 6GB of RAM. The device is also expected to ship out of the box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">One UI 7</a>, which could make it one of the first Samsung phones with the update ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> launch.</p><p>If the predecessor‚Äôs launch is any indication, we expect the Galaxy A26 and its sibling, the Galaxy A16, to launch sometime in December. The Galaxy A25 was priced at around $299, and the successor is believed to fall in the same price segment.</p>

It's a gallery app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-google-photos">cloud storage service</a>, and photo editor all-in-one. One of the great things about Google Photos is that it includes a <strong>Memories</strong> feature that automatically turns your photo library into a digital scrapbook. You can relive past experiences, remember trips, and more.</p><p>There's even a dedicated page in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app for Memories. But what if you don't want to see a certain person or pet in Memories? Luckily, you can curate who shows up in Memories and who doesn't, and this guide will explain how.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-remove-people-and-pets-from-memories-2">How you can remove people and pets from Memories</h2>
<p>To prevent unwanted people and pets from showing up in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-memories-view-rollout">Memories</a>, you can tweak your Google Photos app preferences. You can choose people to <strong>Show less</strong>, which will stop them from individually showing up in your Memories, but may still show them in group photos. Or, you can add people to the <strong>Blocked</strong> list, which will prevent them from showing up in Memories of any kind. Here's how to do it.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Photos app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> to open up a menu.</p><p>3. Then, press <strong>Photos settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Preferences</strong>.</p><p>5. Next, press <strong>Memories</strong>.</p><p>6. Select <strong>Hide people</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dwsbqmyx7mcyrRjgUPG3KN" name="Google-Photos-Memories-Hide-People-Pets" alt="Screenshots of the settings pages for Google Photos Memories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dwsbqmyx7mcyrRjgUPG3KN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>7. You'll now see a list of all the people you've selected to <strong>Show less</strong> or added to <strong>Blocked</strong>. To add a person to the list, press the <strong>+</strong> button, pick a person, and tap <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:378px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CJgVoS3VsxwmjtLcNqWoYm" name="Google-Photos-Remove-Block-People" alt="Brady Snyder / Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJgVoS3VsxwmjtLcNqWoYm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="378" height="378" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From then on, any person or pet you add to <strong>Blocked</strong> will no longer appear in Memories.

<p>Usually, it's fun to be reminded of good memories, but our Google Photos libraries aren't full of good times entirely. They might include photos of an ex-partner, someone you've had a falling out with, or a person or pet that has passed away. That's why Google Photos lets you pick and choose who does (and, more importantly, doesn't) appear in Memories.</p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I was wondering why phones don't have the same instant-on capabilities that newer laptops and Chromebook do. Is there a good reason? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey there, and thanks for the great question! It's something I've never thought about, but now that I've been paying attention, I can definitely see that some phones seem to take a while to get up and running if they've been powered off.</p><p>The quick and dirty answer for people who aren't interested in all the nuances of what happens when a phone boots up is that your phone is checking the software and file system before you get to use it. On some phones that takes longer than others.</p>

<p>To better understand what's happening, you need to understand how a computer boots up. There are three basic stages: powering, reading, and waiting.</p><p>A phone (which is really just another type of computer) sends power to the components on the main board as step one. There are components that need to power up and "run" their software before your phone can get up and running because they tell your phone how to boot itself. These get started once everything has power applied.</p><p>Some things need to be in place before Android or iOS can start on your phone. The reserved portion of the phone's memory needs to be set up to act as a buffer for video, run the firmware that enables the cellular radio, and then unpack and run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">the kernel</a> that tells the hardware how to interact with the software.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Lbt2xbDWvKQ9ovAZvMk9rE" name="google-pixel-9-charging-02.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lbt2xbDWvKQ9ovAZvMk9rE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, if your phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery" target="_blank">battery ran dead</a> (it's not really dead when your phone says it's dead and shuts off), you might have to wait a few minutes until the battery has enough power to get all the hardware up and running because software plays a big part in charging your battery. It can charge while turned off, but not as efficiently as it does when software is helping regulate the incoming power.</p><p>If you've ever let an iPhone battery run down completely, you know this can take a while to get enough charge then take even longer to boot everything up. Short version: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">never let your phone shut off because of a dead battery</a>. Turn it off manually when your battery gets super low and you won't have to deal with this.</p><p>Once the power is applied where it needs to be and the phone knows it has enough power to start the boot sequence, it checks the system software to make sure it's not been tampered with. If your software isn't signed with the right cryptographic key, your phone will not start unless the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-rooting-and-modding">bootloader has been unlocked</a> to allow it.</p><p>If the software checks out, booting begins. Part of the booting process is checking the file structure, creating dynamic symlinks (symbolic links; it's a Unix/Linux thing), and building a pseudo file system (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html">/proc</a> most of the time) for things like statistics and logs. All of this needs to be in place and working as expected before Android can run on your phone. It's all done automatically, but it takes time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RadYvcffTn6PHo3qtfAEQ6" name="Acer Chromebook" alt="Acer Chromebook on table open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RadYvcffTn6PHo3qtfAEQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your phone also needs to do things like connect to a network, load a user profile, allocate memory and resources for services that run at boot, among other small tweaks to get Android itself ready. Many of these things happen simultaneously, but computers really do one task at a time very quickly so it can take some time.</p><p>Once all this is done, your phone is in the waiting state. That's where you unlock your screen and can start using it. It's waiting for input. Some phones can do all of this faster than others, even if they are doing the same basic things.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops">All computers</a> start this way. Some of the steps are different, but computers all need to apply power so booting can start, check that the software is ready, and then wait for your input. There are tricks that can speed this up, and you've probably used them even if you didn't know them, especially on a Windows laptop.</p><p>A PC can store the current state of your computer in a sort of file, then save it to a spot on the memory itself when you're turning it off. Since you're not really killing the power input when you do this, it's ready in an instant when you hit the button and you're right where you left off. This is most likely what happens if you shut the lid on your laptop instead of going through the motions of powering it down.</p><p>Android could do this, but when you consider the size of the battery running everything, you'll know why phone makers don't implement this feature. It'd be exactly the same as letting it sit with the screen off, and it would drain your battery in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Let's get real for a minute and recognize that this doesn't matter in 2024. Older phones (and other computers. too) did take ages to boot up when you power cycled them, but that's not really the case any longer. Some phones, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Google's Pixels</a>, boot up super fast while others like an iPhone take a little longer but none of them take enough time for it to be a problem.</p><p>It is a neat question, though, because it takes a look at what your phone is doing between the time you press the power button and the time when it asks for your password.</p>

<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you&apos;ll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for¬†<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>).¬†</p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you&apos;re willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available.¬†</p>

<p>One of the biggest surprises we&apos;ve seen this holiday shopping season has been the absolutely outrageous discounts on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. These two top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> have only been out since July and yet they&apos;ve already received historic discounts during Amazon&apos;s early Black Friday sale.</p><p>Will the price drop even further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? Only time will tell, but I certainly wouldn&apos;t wait to place your order if you&apos;re interested.¬†</p>
<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>The Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you&apos;ll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season ‚Äî the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you&apos;re looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I&apos;ll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live.¬†</p>

<h2 id="should-you-buy-galaxy-devices-directly-from-samsung-2">Should you buy Galaxy devices directly from Samsung?</h2>
<p>Samsung typically runs a big sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, but the offers on display usually involve a lot of fine print to get the max savings.¬†</p><p>It seems like the site has learned its lesson this year, however, as Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Black Friday deals</strong></a> have never been as good as this.¬†</p><p>The offers I&apos;ve seen so far from the Korean OEM easily rival retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. For example, you can currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f956udbexaa/"><strong>score $800 off the Galaxy Z Fold 6</strong></a> when you buy the phone unlocked in select colors, while the unlocked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-512gb-unlocked-sm-s928ulbfxaa/"><strong>Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a $300 no-strings discount</strong></a> AND a free storage upgrade with select color variants. Neither of these deals require a trade-in or carrier activation, which is honestly pretty remarkable for Samsung.¬†</p>

<hr>
<p>A Garmin Instinct 3 listing leaked on the company's official Spanish website, on a page estimating repair costs. The listing is for a black Garmin Instinct 3 45mm Solar, but provides no further details.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitness-tracker-test.info/en/garmin-instinct-3-first-information-surfaced-online/">Fitness Tracker Test</a> ‚Äî which leaked the information ‚Äî also linked to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked/">Reddit post</a> from June 2024 sharing an alleged photo of the Instinct 3. Users responded skeptically, suggesting that the design was faked. Since there weren't any Instinct 3 renders on the Garmin page, we can't be sure.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/11/17/garmin-instinct-3-release-date/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> also spotted an Instinct 3 reference in Google search results for the official Hungarian Garmin website, with the translated text "Start the new year with a new watch ‚Äî monitoring your health with care all day. Garmin Instinct 3."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Garmin Instinct 2 Solar</a> launched in February 2022, followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-crossover-review">Instinct Crossover Solar</a> hybrid in November 2022 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> in April 2023. Garmin made the 2X Solar. All three used MIP displays with a solar panel overlay to recharge battery life, though the 2X Solar was 50% more efficient than the 2 Solar.</p><p>Since then, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Garmin Fenix 8 and Enduro 3</a> have launched with even <em>better</em> solar recharging efficiency, and we can assume the Instinct 3 will have a similar upgrade. While the last generation technically had "unlimited" battery life with a few hours of sunlight per day, the Instinct 3 should have better GPS battery life and require less time in direct sun for the power boost.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7pv3boyRMWE4BZpX9zjHtJ" name="Garmin-Instinct-2X-vs-2-activities.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar and 2 Solar side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pv3boyRMWE4BZpX9zjHtJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Instinct 2 Solar and 2X Solar </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even without any official leaked information, we can surmise that the Garmin Instinct 3 will have 10ATM water resistance and a thick polymer design. Current models have similar software to the Forerunner series like training load, daily suggested workouts, and recovery time, and the Instinct 3 should get newer features.</p><p>Since the Instinct 2X Solar had a built-in flashlight, it's possible Garmin will make that the standard for the Instinct 3 series, too. Likewise, since the Instinct 2X Solar added multi-band GPS over the GPS-only Instinct 2, the Instinct 3 should either have multi-band GPS or all-systems GNSS for better accuracy.</p><p>There was also a recent leak that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-smartwatches-could-soon-get-support-for-one-of-the-hottest-and-odd-sounding-trends-in-fitness-alongside-the-launch-of-the-instinct-3">Garmin will add a rucking activity</a>, which would be a perfect fit for the rugged Instinct 3 series; I myself recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">dove into rucking</a> and would appreciate better insights from Garmin about muscular load after tough hikes.</p><p>My guess is that the Instinct 3 will arrive in early 2025, about three years after its predecessor. The 45mm Instinct 2 and 40mm Instinct 2S launched at $399, with a $50 surcharge for solar. I suspect the Instinct 3 will also ship in 40mm and 45mm case sizes for the same prices, with a 50mm version coming later.</p>

<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked">garminwatches</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked">r/GarminWatches/comments/1dvikkr/instinct_3_leaked</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>I hope the "leaked Instinct 3" photo above is fake because the Instinct 2 display is probably its biggest weak point. Not because it's a low-resolution MIP, but because of its two-window design that cuts off a huge portion of screen real estate to highlight one random metric.</p><p>I'm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">not a fan of MIP displays</a> in general because they're too dim indoors and strain my eyes, but I tolerate them so long as they're big and colorful enough to display information palatably. The monocolor Instinct 2 display may help it achieve an "unlimited" battery, but it also prevents it from showing much information at once or any fun watch faces. That photo above shows another artificially small display slot and low-res text; let's hope the <em>real</em> Instinct 3 is better.</p><p>If Garmin has made its solar panel that much more efficient, then I'd hope it doesn't need to handicap the display that much. Even though MIP seems to be the Instinct series ' trademark, Garmin could even hypothetically release an AMOLED version that's still long-lived and rugged. Either way, I suspect Garmin will still restrict it to breadcrumb navigation, leaving TopoActive maps for the Fenix 8. And that's fine...so long as they give us a little color.</p><p>Assuming Garmin sticks with the same two-windowed MIP display as before, I'm sure Instinct 2 fans will still buy the Instinct 3, but it'll limit its appeal with a lot of athletes.</p>

<p>With a proper display, the Instinct series could fit the graphs and charts you see on other Forerunner and Venu models. But that'll only work with another upgrade to the processor. I've found that Garmin has historically given the Instinct series a slower CPU than the other models ‚Äî possibly so it's more efficient ‚Äî and that makes navigating through menus a bit annoying. That's another area where I'd love to see an improvement.</p><p>With a smarter CPU and more than a few megabytes of storage, the Instinct 3 could add music playlists and support for wireless earbuds, in case you want to take advantage of that extra juice and stream playlists on the go. And we can hope for an upgrade from the Elevate v4 sensor suite to the v5, which would give us an ECG and skin temperature readings at night.</p><p>Aside from these reasonable (boring) requests, I don't need <em>too</em> many changes. The Garmin Instinct series is excellent at what it does, and anything fancier is fulfilled by the Enduro 3 or Fenix 8 MIP. But I have one pie-in-the-sky Instinct 3 wish: cellular.</p><p>Not counting its Bounce kids watch, Garmin has only released one cellular watch: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a> in 2021. And maybe that means it didn't sell particularly well, scaring Garmin off? But I think the Forerunner series was the wrong place to start for basic LTE safety functions like live-tracking your location for family members, incident detection, and emergency response. The long-lived Instinct series would be a better fit because of its longevity and ability to counteract battery-guzzling LTE with the solar panel, in case your phone dies and you need help out in the wild!</p><p>I'm skeptical Garmin <em>will</em> give the Instinct 3 series (or any other series) cellular, but I can dream! Otherwise, the Instinct series is already among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available today; I'll just have to hope the Instinct 3 lives up to the series' historical quality.</p>

<ul><li>A Reddit user already has their hands on YouTube Music 2024 Recap.</li><li>The Recap, which should normally arrive towards the end of November or the first week of December, is already here for some.</li><li>If more users get the Recap in the coming days, it will be quite earlier than Spotify's Wrapped.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music has a fancy way of engaging its users by showing them the top songs, albums, and artists they've listened to over the year. It is called YouTube Music Recap. Some lucky users this year are getting an early preview of their recaps.</p><p>A Reddit user, FesteringDarkness (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-2024-recap-early-3500210/">Android Authority</a>), appears to be one of the lucky YouTube Music users who have already gotten their hands on the YouTube Recap 2024. Per the shared screenshot of the latest Recap, one can see the user's respective Top artists and Top Tracks on YouTube Music that they listened to the most throughout 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1grmzb1/got_my_yearly_recap">Got my yearly recap</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic">r/YoutubeMusic</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Additionally, users can see the number of total minutes they spent on the YouTube Music app listening to their favorites. Alongside the top tracks and artists, users can notice their top albums as well. While the Recap is kind of new to YouTube's streaming platform, its competitor Spotify has had it for a while, dubbed Spotify Wrapped.</p><p>If history is any guide, the latter's summary frequently arrives early. Just after Spotify's Wrapped last year, YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">released its 2023 Recap</a>, which took place in late November 2023. Even though we are in the same month this year, some individuals receiving it ahead of schedule could indicate that YouTube Music will release the Recap early.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the person who received it might have been extremely fortunate, or there might have been a glitch in the streaming service. As more users may receive it in the upcoming weeks, it should become evident.</p><p>Users who want to access their Recap on YouTube Music can either look for the banner, which should appear when the Recap of their music is ready, or navigate to the "Your Recap" section from their My Account page on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming app</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube and YouTube Music gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-and-youtube-music-gain-new-improvements">some nifty improvements</a> through a major update last month. The music streaming service has introduced new Badges, which users can add to their favorite creators.</p><p>Also, both have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">gained the ability</a> to customize their playlist thumbnails by choosing a photo of their personal choice or relying on Generative AI entirely.</p>

<ul><li>Google is allegedly in the process of a new project dubbed "Snowy," which is rumored to be a "Pixel laptop."</li><li>The device is supposedly being created to combat Apple's MacBook Pro and Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook.</li><li>Google bowed out of the laptop game years ago and the recent Chromebook Plus from Samsung packs a lot of its Gemini smarts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Curious new rumors claim Google might re-enter the laptop space with a "Pixel Laptop" of its own.</p><p>This rumor stems from an alleged "internal email" obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">Android Headlines</a>. According to its post, Google is preparing to begin developing a new laptop. The publication states the project is known internally as "Snowy." There are conflicting reports on what such a device could run as an OS (operating system).</p><p>The post suggests Google could empower the laptop with ChromeOS; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">another report</a> states this could end up turning into Android, instead. Mishaal Rahman for Android Authority claims that a source informed him that Google was moving into a "multi-year project to fully turn Chrome OS into Android."</p><p>Allegedly, this is done with the notion of competing with Apple's iPad experience. Google is also reportedly working on a large number of Android features to improve the desktop-like experience by upgrading its keyboard and mouse support.</p><p>Additional rumors claim the "Pixel laptop," or whatever it may be called, will feature a "premium build." It seems the supposed email lacks extra details on this matter. Elsewhere, the publication notes that Google is reportedly building this new laptop and comparing it against Apple's MacBook Pro, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-vs-galaxy-chromebook">Galaxy Chromebook</a>, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop among others.</p><p>It is extremely early for such a leak, so take things with a grain of salt as "Project Snowy" might not come to fruition.</p>

<p>It's worth remembering that Google once had its own laptop, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook-review">the Pixelbook</a>, several years ago. At the time, the company called its in-house device "the laptop reimagined." Google deployed a laptop with a thin profile with power specs (at the time) that was a breath of fresh air for consumers looking for a computer. The company then followed things up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixelbook-go-looks-step-wrong-direction">Pixelbook Go</a>, which was notably a step in the wrong direction.</p><p>Unfortunately, we never got a "Pixelbook 2," though it seems <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook">Samsung continued the dreams</a> we once had for Google.</p><p>It remains to be seen where the company will go with this (potential) laptop resurgence. Remember: Samsung launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">new Chromebook Plus</a> in October alongside Lenovo's newest model. The Korean OEM's model features a 15.6-inch display and an 11.8mm profile at 2.5lbs. What's more, the highlight of the laptop was its suite if Gemini tools.</p><p>The device boasts several AI-based features like "help me write," "help me read," Chat with Gemini, and more. Considering Google's heavy investment in AI ‚Äî especially after its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-second-reorg-gemini-assistant-moves">second major reorg</a> for the betterment of the software ‚Äî it seems right that this alleged "Pixel laptop" followed a similar route.</p>

<hr>
<p>After launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> in China, the phone maker is set to bring its latest flagship to global markets soon. While we've seen its specs and features, OnePlus is supposedly tweaking the color and storage options for the international release.</p><p>OnePlus has traditionally focused on China first, launching exclusive colors for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">flagship devices</a>. But a new leak suggests the OnePlus 13 will take a more global approach, with a consistent lineup for international markets.</p><p>Leaker Ars√®ne Lupin (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-13r-global-colors-ram-storage-configs-3499913/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) has uncovered the global configurations and color options for the OnePlus 13 and its budget-friendly sibling, the OnePlus 13R. The base OnePlus 13 will allegedly come with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though it'll only be available in Black Eclipse.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OnePlus 13 5G16/51212/256 (only Black Ecplise)Black EclipseMidnight OceanArctic DawnOnePlus 13R 5G12/256Nebula NoirAstral TrailGlobal soon<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1857064642243092537">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Alongside the base model, OnePlus might release a OnePlus 13 variant with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. This high-end version is said to come in three stunning colors: Midnight Ocean (blue), Black Eclipse (black), and Arctic Dawn (white). Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>‚Äôs staggered rollout, the white color could be available from day one.</p><p>As a result, if you're eyeing the more vibrant colors, you'll have to go for the 16GB/512GB variant, which comes at a higher price than the base model.</p><p>Though options like the 12GB/512GB and the massive 24GB/1TB variants are available in China, they‚Äôre missing from the leak, suggesting that these models may not make it to international markets.</p><p>Furthermore, the leak spills the beans on the budget-friendly OnePlus 13R. The device is said to come in just one configuration‚Äî12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage‚Äîand two colors: Nebula Noir and Astral Trail. Even though the 13R hasn‚Äôt launched in China yet, it‚Äôs expected to arrive globally alongside the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R is expected to be called the OnePlus Ace 5 in its home turf, though the phone maker hasn't officially unveiled the device in China yet. After its debut, it's expected to be rebranded as the OnePlus 13R globally.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 series should be hitting global markets in the next few months, probably with a price bump compared to the OnePlus 12.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung details some new camera technology that may alleviate the dreaded "camera bump" issue.</p><p>According to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/news-events/tech-blog/samsung-isocell-alop-camera-technology-brightens-the-night-but-keeps-the-camera-slim/">tech post</a>, the company is developing a new telephoto camera technology under the name "ALoP" (All Lenses of Prism). The post states this is a "future telephoto camera solution" that retains clarity and brightness during the day or night. Usually, smartphones with a "set of large telephoto lenses" would have a rather noticeable camera bump.</p><p>However, Samsung states it aims to rectify that with its ALoP technology. The company says its new method uses a new optical structure that places the lenses "horizontally upon the prism, remaining in the plane of the smartphone body." Samsung states it can increase the effective lens size and diameter with ALoP <em>without </em>increasing the module's size (which gives us the camera bump).</p><p>The standard "folded" method places the camera's optics length-wise, meaning they're stacked vertically, pushing up against the phone's rear panel.</p><p>Samsung claims that its ALoP method not only reduces the size and thickness of a camera bump, but it has an additional key benefit: brightness.</p><p>The post states the ALoP technology can accommodate an <em>f</em>/2.5 aperture 80mm lens on a phone. Essentially, the lower the aperture number, the wider the lens opens for darker shots to receive more light. Samsung hopes this can provide consumers with a noise reduction when taking nighttime shots.</p><p>Another positive side effect is the ergonomic or aesthetical side of a camera bump reduction. Samsung states the ALoP method can potentially help it retain the "sleek" appearance of a phone since the "jarring" look of the bump is reduced.</p>

<p>Samsung cited increased consumer interest in cameras as a catalyst behind <em>why </em>OEMs have added more lenses, creating a "crowded" array. This was a sentiment echoed by Google after it launched the Pixel 9 series with its (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large and proud</a>) camera bump. Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger said that user interest is the reason behind "larger lenses and sensors.</p><p>Of course, wanting a lens with a longer focal length or with a lower aperture is nice, but that comes at a cost. Zellweger teased that a thinner camera bump could be possible in the future and that the Pixel 9's current design might not last forever.</p><p>For Samsung, it's unclear <em>when </em>we could see the ALoP tech's influence on a Galaxy device's telephoto module. Early rumors about the Galaxy S25 claim it will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">similar camera specs</a> to its 2024 iteration. However, a major camera development could arrive for the alleged "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">Galaxy S25 Slim</a>" with a strength that mirrors the Ultra model.</p>
