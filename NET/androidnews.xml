<hr>
<p>With the Galaxy Unpacked event merely a week away, tipster Evan Blass has shared new marketing images of the foldables—the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6—and they don&apos;t leave much to anticipate from the launch event.</p><p>The new set of shared images was leaked through his Substack newsletter, which confirms every possible spec of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> coming later on July 10 at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Unpacked event in Paris</a>. Per the marketing images, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is confirmed to be lighter, slimmer, and have a refreshing design with sharper corners than the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodness will be widely seen across the interface, even on Samsung Notes, as the new Note Assist feature will be able to transcribe recordings, organize them in notes, and create efficient summaries. The large foldable screen is also poised to have a pocket-sized interpreter with two displays to translate in real time. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 users could also take advantage of Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> prowess.</p><p>The marketing images further reveal the Galaxy Z Fold 6 cameras, which involve a triple rear camera setup with 50MP acting as the primary lens aided by a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera and a 10MP telephoto camera with optical zoom. On the front, there is a 10MP selfie shooter on the cover screen and a 4MP under-display camera on the foldable screen. Galaxy AI is further expected in cameras and post-edit scenarios to complement the shots taken.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 could have a more durable design than before as the hinge is getting slimmer. Samsung appears to be using "an improved Aluminum frame" and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for additional protection. </p><p>The other notable aspect of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its IP rating, as it now features dust resistance for the first time. It now comes with IP48 dust and water resistance, whereas the previous iteration only had water resistance with an IPX8 rating.</p>
<p>Per the leaked images, the prominent specifications include a bigger 6.3-inch cover screen and the same 7.6-inch foldable screen. The Z Fold 6 will weigh 239 grams, which is significantly less than the predecessor, which weighed 253 grams. It will measure 12.1mm in thickness when folded and 5.6mm when unfolded, which is again a bit less than the Z Fold 5. The foldable phone will also equip the same 4400mAh battery capacity as before.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>, an overclocked version of the regular SD 8 Gen 3 SoC. It will also have S-Pen support, which is rumored to be more beneficial than before. Users can further expect at least 12GB of RAM coupled with up to 512GB of onboard storage.</p>

<p>The smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>&apos;s marketing material also reveals the clamshell phone in a blue colorway alongside its prominent specs. The design, however, remains unchanged when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. </p><p>Samsung is also promoting the new interpreter on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which can utilize both screens to facilitate translation when needed. The cover screen will further benefit from the Chat Assist feature, allowing you to text suggested replies to messages without opening the foldable screen.</p><p>Again, the Circle to Search, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy, 50MP primary lens, 12MP secondary camera, 10MP selfie shooter, and IP48 rating are the other prominent features shared along its sibling Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6&apos;s design includes a 3.4-inch cover screen and a 6.7-inch foldable screen. It will have mainly the same dimensions as the predecessor but a larger 4000mAh battery capacity. Also, for the first time, Samsung has incorporated a vapor chamber into its clamshell phone.</p><p>This set of leaked images gives us more than a fair idea of what to expect at next week&apos;s launch.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have over a dozen Bluetooth speakers in the house, but in the last year and a half, I&apos;ve only used Tribit&apos;s products — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-stormbox-blast-is-my-new-favorite-bluetooth-speaker">StormBox Blast</a> is the go-to choice if I want wall-shaking sound, and I turn to the StormBox Pro for all portable needs. While I like the latter&apos;s convenience, it doesn&apos;t have any ingress protection, and that&apos;s where the Flow comes in.</p><p>Tribit unveiled the StormBox Flow at the end of last year, and its key differentiator is IP67 ingress protection, allowing it to be used just about anywhere. So if you need a speaker to take to the pool or for use in the shower, the Flow is the best choice in Tribit&apos;s catalog. And like the rest of the brand&apos;s products, it is inherently affordable; the StormBox Flow usually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Flow-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B0CCJ3XHK5">retails for $79 on Amazon</a>, but you can buy it for just $60 right now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cuCxKJ5fGPzPS649SxUXoV" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-2.jpg" alt="Tribit logo on the StormBox Flow grille" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuCxKJ5fGPzPS649SxUXoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the StormBox Blast and Pro have a similar design scheme with dark colors, and Tribit didn&apos;t make too many changes with the Flow. The speaker comes in a lighter grey color, but the design is still muted and unobtrusive. The flatter profile makes the Flow easier to travel with, and coming in at 662g, it isn&apos;t too heavy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LNaBgRaRQuSe3LrihT5FeW" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-9.jpg" alt="Back of Tribit StormBox Flow with rubber feet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LNaBgRaRQuSe3LrihT5FeW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the design of the Flow is that you can easily change orientation; you can have it facing forward by default, or have it on the back. Another nifty addition is stereo pairing, where you can combine two units to create an immersive stereo sound. The build quality itself is fantastic, and I have no problems in this area. The overall design isn&apos;t flashy, and that&apos;s not a bad thing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h7dhYDocrEktJDXPQP9D4W" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-4.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow's controls highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h7dhYDocrEktJDXPQP9D4W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The control buttons are located at the top, and you get the usual power and Bluetooth buttons in addition to EQ, and a stereo mode that lets you connect two units together. The playback controls include volume up and down buttons along with a multifunction key that handles play/pause with a short press, invoking digital assistants with a long press, and seek controls — three presses to go to the previous track, and two to go to the next.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a lot to like when it comes to connectivity as well; the StormBox Flow pairs via Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with signal quality even at range — it was able to maintain a steady connection beyond 30 feet. Pairing is as straightforward as it gets; just hold down the Bluetooth button for two seconds, and the Flow goes into pairing mode. You can use it to take calls as well, and it does a good job in this area.</p>

<p>As the Flow has IP67 ingress protection, you can comfortably use it at the pool without any issues; I used it extensively as a shower speaker, and it is ideally suited for this task. There&apos;s a lanyard that attaches to the right, and it allows you to hang the Flow to a hook or shower caddy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-12.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow with phone next to it running Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the rest of the products in the StormBox series, the Flow delivers incredible sound — this is the defining characteristic of the speaker, and it holds up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers-under-100">best Bluetooth speakers under $100</a> in this area. It is able to deliver 25W via two drivers, the sound is vibrant and detailed out of the box, and you can enable XBass mode to drastically increase low-end energy. Doing so means the bass exuberance bleeds into the mid-range, but the added rumble and vigor is highly enjoyable. The treble isn&apos;t as detailed, but you still get good overall definition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V27YTbzKQviJ2CANFRtxMX" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-13.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow with phone next to it and EQ settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V27YTbzKQviJ2CANFRtxMX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also tweak the EQ by downloading the Tribit app, and while it isn&apos;t intuitive, it allows you to adjust the sound to your liking. There are preset modes available — including Audiobook, Classical, Rock, and Jazz — and they make a noticeable difference to the sound. The only issue with the sound quality is that the Flow doesn&apos;t have LDAC or any AptX codecs; you&apos;re limited to the standard AAC and SBC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S7QRAwjTL3JydZTY2WxZmW" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-8.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow's USB-C charging connector located on the left" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S7QRAwjTL3JydZTY2WxZmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is another area where the Flow excels; I got over 20 hours of music playback with a single charge out of the 4800mAh battery, and this is with XBass mode enabled — you can eke out much better battery life otherwise. It&apos;s a good thing that the speaker lasts a long time on a full charge, as it takes four hours to charge the internal battery. There&apos;s no fast charging — it only goes up to 10W — and I basically plugged it in overnight to charge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h8MBCubWciutqswRoDWTWX" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-14.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow with Tribit running on phone showing battery level" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8MBCubWciutqswRoDWTWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of the slow charging and missing AptX codecs, there isn&apos;t anything to fault with the StormBox Flow. The Bluetooth speaker has good build quality, easily accessible controls, and with IP67 dust and water resistance, you can use it anywhere. The sound quality is great, the EQ lets you adjust the audio profile, and it lasts over 20 hours between charges.</p><p>If you need a portable Bluetooth speaker with terrific sound that can be used outdoors, the StormBox Flow is one of the best around — particularly in the sub-$100 segment.</p>

<p>Nothing&apos;s CMF has revealed the full design and color options for the CMF Phone 1, which will feature a customizable back panel.</p><p>CMF is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-by-nothing-phone-1-july-launch-confirmed">set to debut its first smartphone on July 8</a>, and it’s generating a lot of excitement in the mobile market.

<p>The phone features a unique pill-shaped dual camera module in the top left corner, standing out with a contrasting color scheme. This design element matches the colors of the volume rocker on the left and the power button on the right.</p><p>The CMF Phone 1 goes for an "engineer&apos;s aesthetic," as the company puts it, showing off visible screws and sharp edges. There&apos;s also a new feature on the bottom left of the back panel: a circular dial that looks like the one on the CMF Buds charging case. This dial isn&apos;t just for show; it could work as a lanyard attachment, a kickstand, or even a spot for extra accessories, making the phone even more customizable.</p><p>The image also shows a small flat-head screwdriver, which might double as a SIM card ejector tool.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1808462425030578345" target="_blank">recent teaser</a> from CMF revealed the CMF Phone 1&apos;s color options: black, orange, blue, and light green.

<p>A find in Gemini&apos;s code on Android shows Google&apos;s apparent interest in boosting its abilities, by offering a split screen addition.</p><p>A dive into the Gemini app on Android&apos;s latest beta version by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-multi-window-mode-3456690/">Android Authority</a> showcases a feature that lets users split the AI&apos;s initial pop-up window. It&apos;s unclear when this will roll out. However, version 15.26.34 shows that users can "drag and drop" a new window by long-pressing the pop-up&apos;s handle.</p><p>This window is produced by swiping up from the bottom right of Android&apos;s UI.</p><p>After enabling the appropriate flag, long-pressing the handle copies Gemini&apos;s initial window before displaying Android&apos;s typical, vertical split screen view on phones. The beta shows that the second window appears as a more compact version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">main Gemini app</a> with your Google account icon visible, alongside some suggested queries and the pill-shaped text box.</p><p>The original window remains at the bottom with the same design that Android users are used to seeing when producing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> through its swipe command. In testing, the publication states that users can converse with Gemini in both windows without issue.</p><p>Dragging the bottom window up by its handle will remove the cloned copy and vice versa.</p><p>While the beta&apos;s code shows Gemini&apos;s cloned pop-up window on a phone&apos;s split view, it seems likely that this will arrive for tablets, too. It also seems like this won&apos;t be Google Pixel exclusive, as a string referencing Samsung was found for this "drag and drop" feature.</p>

<p>In June, Google finally started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-finally-available-for-more-android-phones-in-messages">AI Gemini for Messages</a> on more phones. Devices with 6GB of RAM or more can utilize the software&apos;s abilities, such as drafting text messages or asking questions about any topic. Conversating with Gemini in Messages will create its own thread for easy rediscovery. For a while, the AI was only available in Messages for Pixel and Galaxy devices.</p><p>Google highlighted its work to bring Gemini&apos;s AI smarts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">the school system</a> by incorporating teen student accounts and tools for teachers. Students will soon be able to ask Gemini questions; however, the company states that guardrails are in place to ensure a child&apos;s safety.</p><p>Tools for teachers involve a bolstered Read Along in Classrooms and the ability to assign reading material to students based on their reading data.</p>

<ul><li>Recent speculation states Samsung could move away from the Plus model when it launches the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The theory comes from a database listing, which oddly lacks a model number that could point toward the Plus model.</li><li>However, a discovery quickly refuted this theory, stating Samsung has internal codenames for all three devices, including the model number for the S25 Plus.</li><li>Samsung's S24 Plus was a massive success this year as users were given that "sweet spot" with its QHD+ display and more RAM for a better price point.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we await Samsung&apos;s 2024 summer event, a new theory suggests its next flagship phone line could drop a key member.</p><p>A database discovery by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/07/exclusive-samsung-makes-radical-change-with-galaxy-s25-series-no-more-plus-model.html">Android Headlines</a> showed that Samsung might only have plans for two S25 devices. From the listing, a device was discovered with model number SM-S931B/DS, which is supposedly the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">S25 model</a>. Another device was found with the following number: SM-S938B. This same model was available several more times with varying end tags such as "U" and "N."</p><p>It was explained that the letters signify the region of its debut, with "B" representing the global market, "U" for the U.S., and "N" for South Korea.</p><p>Although this theoretical lack of a Galaxy S25 Plus seems extremely unlikely, the post states that it could be a strategic move by Samsung. The publication also adds that the specifications of the Plus and base models have moved closer over the years.</p><p>Speculation suggests the company is more focused on pushing its Ultra version over a boosted base model.</p><p>However, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s25/">GalaxyClub</a> discovered that Samsung&apos;s development of all <em>three </em>S25 models is proceeding (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-model-not-cancelled/">SamMobile</a>). The Dutch publication found evidence of three internal codenames: F1, F2, and F3, which reportedly refer to the S25, S25 Plus, and the S25 Ultra. Additionally, the Plus model bears model number SM-S936, filling the gap between the other two devices.</p>

<p>It would be odd if Samsung dropped its middle device following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">the success of the Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Shortly after its January launch, early sales analytics for the device showed that the S24 Plus was more popular than its 2023 counterpart, achieving a 54% increase in revenue.</p><p>The middle Plus sibling is typically a slightly boosted base model, though this year&apos;s version brought QHD+ resolution for its large display. The S24 Plus also boasts 12GB of RAM to complement its suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features. Moreover, Minsoo Kang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, stated that the S24 Plus was Samsung&apos;s "big driver" in 2024. Kang added, "it&apos;s hitting the sweet spot on pricing, nudging upgraders as well as specs to support new users wanting optimized on-device AI."</p><p>Other early rumors about the device suggest Samsung could drop Exynos and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon</a> SoC on its S25 series in all regions.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-design-changes-rumor">a report from South Korea</a> highlighted the chance for a slightly larger S25 display at 6.3 inches. The post added that "overall" design changes could land in the upcoming series, as well.</p>

<ul><li>A batch of alleged promotional material-like imagery for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 leaked on X, showcasing the phone in a blue colorway.</li><li>The images seemingly clue us into Samsung's Flip 6 segment of the device's health data, sleep information, and cover display clock face.</li><li>Samsung confirmed that its Unpacked event will take place on July 10.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another batch of leaked Flip 6 material shows Samsung&apos;s next clamshell with its supposed event designs.</p><p>The latest leaks stem from X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1808377808193786053">Evan Blass</a>, who posted a set of four images of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in a blue colorway. It&apos;s been evident for a while now that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">keep the design the same</a>, and these leaks continue that trend. The first of the four shows the device up close with its blue-accented dual camera array, and the cover display&apos;s rather thick side bezels.</p><p>Blass added two more photos, which might&apos;ve spilled Samsung&apos;s health-focused segment of the Flip 6&apos;s reveal. The photos tease the device&apos;s health and fitness data, such as steps walked, workout minutes, calories burned, and an example of a night&apos;s rest.</p><p>Another image purports the phone&apos;s "lock screen" on the cover. Samsung may show the device with different, stylized numbers for its stacked clock on either side of the screen. Then, Blass showed an image of the Flip 6 in its Flex Mode, capable of being placed at a 90-degree angle for photos, video calls, and more.</p><p>One final photo highlighted the Flip 6&apos;s small form factor when folded, while also focusing on its hinge.</p>

<p>The hype continues to mount for the next Flip, which recently had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/overseas-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-listing-color-leak">several of its colorways</a> leaked by an overseas source. The supposed renders showcased the phone in green (mint), gray, light blue, and yellow options. There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">another rumor</a> that said the Flip 6 could grab exclusive online store colors, such as white and black, alongside a new "Peach" hue.</p><p>One area that the Flip 6 could improve over its predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-leak-hints-at-a-bigger-battery-and-improved-camera">is its battery</a>. Rumors claim Samsung could pack a 4,000mAh battery into the device, increasing its capacity from 3,700mAh. This could be joined by a stronger 50MP primary sensor, as well. Moreover, consumers may still find a 256GB and a 512GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-storage-color-options-leak">storage option</a> for the clamshell once it launches.</p><p>The whispers won&apos;t be around for much longer as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Samsung confirmed</a> that its next Unpacked event will occur on July 10 in Paris, France. Interested parties can snag $50 from the company as its Galaxy device reserve program continues.</p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming Pixel 9 in Pink shows up in a new video ahead of its official launch.</li><li>The new hands-on video also showcases the display of the Pixel 9 next to the device from all angles.</li><li>The official launch of the Pixel 9 series is set for August 13 through Made by Google event.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After witnessing a Pink Pixel 9 in a set of images and a hands-on video on Tuesday (July 2), another video surfaced on the web, giving the audience a closer look at the upcoming flagship.</p><p>While the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">leaked hands-on video</a> showcased the device from all angles, it didn&apos;t show it with its screen turned on. The latest one, shared by a user with the username "Reparation Mobile 23" on Facebook (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel9-9-leak-screen-on-3456648/">Android Authority</a>), reveals the screen in action to some extent. </p><p>It doesn&apos;t drastically differ from the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series, as it still has a conventional punch-hole screen and a flat display. The interface on the inside looks unchanged, too.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pixel-9-leaked-video.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pixel-9-leaked-video.mp4"></video></div>
<p>The device is shown in all possible angles, aside from the screen. At the bottom, the Pixel 9 has a single speaker grille, USB Type-C, and a SIM card slot, while the volume rockers and the home button are on the side pane. </p><p>The dual cameras are seen inside the camera visor, which is accompanied by an LED flash. The visor sports a matte finish, and the back appears glossy, similar to the previous hands-on video.</p><p>Aside from the all-new pink color and aforementioned details, nothing concrete is there to comprehend. The leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">high-quality renders</a> of the Pixel 9 and its siblings have given us a fairly clear picture of what to expect at the Made by Google event. </p>
<p>Regardless, it is still a major leak, given that the launch is still a month away. The previous leak also indicated that the device is already available in the Algerian market. </p><p>Along with the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro and an all-new Pixel 9 Pro XL model will likely debut at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">Made By Google event</a> on August 13. Next to the Pixel phones, the Pixel Watch 3 and the new generation of Pixel Buds are the other expected devices from Google. With this major hands-on leak, we expect similar significant leaks to pop up as we march toward the Pixel launch event.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-how-much-water-your-motorola-razr-2024-can-resist-2">This is how much water your Motorola Razr 2024 can resist</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re considering getting the Razr 2024, these words will usually come to mind: is the Razr 2024 waterproof? Fortunately, the new Motorola is waterproof. But unfortunately, it lacks protection from dust. The Motorola Razr 2024 features an IP (ingress protection) rating of IPX8, which indicates that you can drop it in fresh water as deep as 1.5 meters for as long as 30 minutes without suffering water damage. This rating is given by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which tells users how much water their device can withstand. So, the phone should be OK if you ever get caught in a rainstorm or drop it in the bathtub.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-vs-razr-2023">Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vs. Razr 2024</a> comparison also revealed the same IP rating for both phones. However, testing was done in a lab with fresh water, not the highly chlorinated water found in pools or seawater. You should also avoid liquids such as sugary juices and soft drinks since they could cause permanent damage. It&apos;s also a good idea to be careful with liquids such as alcohol and soap.</p><p>The X in the IPX8 rating means it did not undergo testing for dust resistance. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it has no dust resistance, but the device did not undergo testing. However, if there were a zero instead of an X, it would have no resistance to dust particles. A six indicates it&apos;s sealed tight against dust for up to eight hours. If you go somewhere with a lot of dust in the air, it&apos;s best to keep your phone in a dust-proof pouch to prevent any possible damage.</p>

<p>The second number reveals how resistant the device is to water, with nine being the highest rating possible and zero being the lowest. A smartphone with a military-grade IP69K rating (the highest rating possible) would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/blackview-bl8800-pro-review">Blackview BL8800 Pro</a>, which can withstand high-pressure water jets and dust, which you find in equipment for food processing and pharmaceutical applications.</p><p>You can help extend your phone&apos;s IP rating by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-and-disinfect-your-android-smartphone">cleaning it well</a> if you see dust on it or drying it with a microfiber cloth if it&apos;s wet. Your phone will not always have the IPX8 rating since it can deteriorate over time, even more so when it&apos;s not handled correctly and frequently drops. High humidity and extreme temperatures will also decrease the rating over time. Therefore, the older your phone is, the more cautious you should be around water and dusty areas.</p><p>It&apos;s also best to avoid making any modifications to the phone, such as changing the display without talking to an authorized handler, since this can void your warranty and damage the IPX8 rating.</p><p>The highest common rating for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, is an IP68 rating, which means it&apos;s dust-tight against solid particles (6) and waterproof for a depth of 1.5 meters and 30 minutes (8).</p>

It doesn&apos;t work like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate</a> feature you would find in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, but still a great tool to have around.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-google-translate-on-gboard-2">How to enable Google Translate on Gboard</h2>
<p>You can use Gboard translate on any app where you can type. If you haven&apos;t done so, you&apos;ll need to install Gboard on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Android phone</a> and make it your default keyboard. If the app doesn&apos;t show you an option to make it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-default-keyboard-your-android-phone">your default keyboard</a>, you can do so by following these steps:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>System</strong> option.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Language & input</strong>.</p><p>4. Select the <strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> option.</p><p>4. Toggle on <strong>Gboard.</strong></p><p>Ensure that Gboard is toggled on. Then, you can easily switch it by tapping the keyboard icon at the bottom right of your display. The steps could be different depending on the model of your Android smartphone.</p>

<p>Once you have Gboard as your default keyboard, open an app where you can type a message, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. Once you&apos;re ready to type:</p><p>1. Tap the <strong>Translate button</strong> at the top of the keyboard. If you don&apos;t see it, tap the icon that looks like four tiny squares together and tap the translate option. You can drag it to the top for faster access.</p><p>2. <strong>Choose the languages</strong> you want to translate from and to at the top. The languages above the line indicate the language packs you&apos;ve downloaded. If you don&apos;t see the language, you must swipe up and select your preferred language.</p><p>You&apos;ll see two arrows between the languages, which allow you to switch between them. For example, tap the arrows if you&apos;re translating from English to French and want to switch from French to English.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:675px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:111.11%;"><img id="bpx7kgzhGFmP27o6Fz5GvB" name="Choose-language-Gboard.jpg" alt="Choosing a language to translate from and to on Gboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bpx7kgzhGFmP27o6Fz5GvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="675" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. At the bottom, <strong>type in the language</strong> you want to translate from, and you&apos;ll see the translated text at the top. Even if you erase one word, that word will also be erased at the top in the translated text bar.</p><p>If you don&apos;t feel like typing, you can use voice-to-text for faster results. To do so, tap the mic icon on the keyboard&apos;s right. If you don&apos;t see it, tap Gboard&apos;s cogwheel to access <strong>Settings</strong>, choose <strong>Voice typing</strong>, and ensure that it&apos;s <strong>toggled on</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-apps-up-to-date-2">Keep your apps up to date</h2>
<p>Keep your apps updated to ensure that Gboard runs smoothly and you always get the latest updates on the keyboard. Even if you have it set so your apps are updated automatically, manually check for any pending updates. To check for updates, do the following:</p><p>1. Opening <strong>Google Play</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Manage apps & device</strong>.</p><p>4. Check under <strong>Updates available</strong>.</p><p>If you&apos;re worried about storage space, you can only update the Gboard app and leave the others for later. You can also tap the Update All button to update your apps.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-if-gboard-apos-s-translate-as-you-type-feature-is-not-working-2">What to do if Gboard&apos;s translate as you type feature is not working</h2>
<p>Like any other app, Gboard may fail to translate as you type occasionally, and there could be various reasons why. Ensure you have a good Internet connection and your Wi-Fi signal isn&apos;t so weak that it affects how it works. You can also try restarting your phone for a fresh start and ensuring you have all your apps up to date. It could also not be your fault and the error could be on Google&apos;s side, in that case, the best thing you can do is wait it out and try later.</p>
<h2 id="keep-on-translating-2">Keep on translating</h2>
<p>Gboard&apos;s translate as you type feature is a great tool when you&apos;re learning a new language and need some help expressing your ideas. It won&apos;t always get the grammar part of the language right. For example, if you want to say something to a female friend, Gboard translates it as intended for a male friend in some languages with gendered pronouns. These errors can be embarrassing, but hopefully, this will be corrected soon.</p><p>The feature works on older Android phones as well as new ones, especially newer flagship phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>. You may not use it as much on newer phones since they come with features such as Live Translate, but it&apos;s good to know it&apos;s there if you ever need it.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel phones receive the latest July system update following the Pixel Watch models.</li><li>The update includes phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to Pixel 8a, as well as Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet.</li><li>Google has also addressed the recent factory reset issue on Pixel 6, 6 Pro, and 6a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After rolling out the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-july-2024-update"> July update </a>to the Pixel Watch just a few days ago, Google is now bringing the monthly software update to Pixel phones powered by Android 14.</p><p>Pixel phones ranging from Pixel 5a (5G) to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> alongside the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet will receive the latest security patch from Google, the company notes in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/283199250/google-pixel-update-july-2024?hl=en&sjid=12145797219137462659-AP">accompanying support post</a>. </p><p>The July update carries bug fixes and improvements. Per the changelog, general improvements for camera stability "under certain conditions" can be seen on devices including Pixel 5a (5G), Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7a, Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet.</p>
<p>Similarly, the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> models show general system stability and performance improvements in certain conditions. Lastly, a user interface bug fix is coming for Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a, which addresses the back gesture navigation issue that wasn&apos;t working in certain scenarios.</p><p>The system update bearing the <strong>AP2A.240705.004 </strong>version will be rolled out globally to Pixel 5a (5G) and Pixel Fold models. The other firmware, <strong>AP2A.240705.005</strong>, is exclusive to Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel 8a models. The same handsets on the Telus carrier will receive the <strong>AP2A.240705.005.A1</strong> firmware.</p><p>The latest update, however, doesn&apos;t address the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">factory reset issue</a> that bricked some Pixel phones, including the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, and Pixel 6a. Meanwhile, in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/283220215/issues-after-factory-resetting-pixel-6-devices?hl=en&sjid=12145797219137462659-AP">another community post</a>, Google addressed the issue, indicating that the "team has identified the root cause of the issue and is working on developing the best possible solution."</p>
<p>Until then, to avoid the issue, Google recommends leaving the device untouched for at least 15 minutes after a system update. Following this, users can factory reset their devices or, alternatively, factory reset before performing the latest system update.</p><p>The update rollout began Tuesday (July 3) and should be available to the aforementioned Pixel owners in the upcoming weeks. It will be in phases and depend on the carrier and device.</p>
