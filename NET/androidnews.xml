                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Things are kind of heating up in the Android tablet space, as we’re seeing more and more players get into the mix. However, the only true competition that Samsung has seen, comes from a little company out in Cupertino, California, aka Apple. Samsung is hopeful that with its pending launch of the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra, it will be able to pull ahead of Apple and maintain its dominance on the Android side.</p><p>Before getting into the nitty gritty, the first major surprise is that Samsung is opting to forgo the 11-inch model. That leaves us with the 12.4-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, and the massive 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Although we don’t know the explicit reason behind this decision, we can surmise that it has something to do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Tab S9 FE</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-briefly-shows-up-in-us">Tab A9 Plus</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o3FWWt8u98hL9DdDQbnBuD" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-ai-features-presentation.jpg" alt="Galaxy AI features on Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3FWWt8u98hL9DdDQbnBuD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically what it seems to boil down to is that if you want a smaller tablet, then the FE is the way to go. Otherwise, you’ll need to spring for the larger and more “premium” options. </p><p>With that out of the way, Samsung spent a good amount of time emphasizing a couple of things. The first of which was how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Galaxy Tablets</a> help to provide an all-encompassing ecosystem while being able to do much more than just act as a media playback device. No, we aren’t talking about any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>-like experiences, although the idea of a tablet that doubles as a SmartThings hub is rather intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="take-all-of-the-galaxy-ai-you-can-handle-2">Take all of the Galaxy AI you can handle</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-sketch-to-image-tree-2.jpg" alt="Sketch to Image results on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, we were inundated with an almost constant barrage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> comments and blurbs. According to Samsung, 75% of its customers have “engaged with AI features” and there were “18 million uses of Galaxy AI in one week.” Those numbers are downright impressive, especially when considering that they only apply to Samsung’s U.S. market. </p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung also stated that there are already more than 100 million Galaxy AI-enabled devices available. More importantly, the company hopes to double that number “by the end of this year.” It’s a lofty goal, for sure, but if there’s one company that could follow through, it’s Samsung. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sRP92sHQSTYy9GbQkeypVU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-circle-to-search-bar.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Circle to Search bottom bar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sRP92sHQSTYy9GbQkeypVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In order to do so, that means getting Galaxy AI into the hands of more people, whether it be through software updates or releasing new devices. Samsung is opting for both, which started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI 6.1.1</a> on the software side, and the push is continuing with the four devices announced.</p><p>So just where does the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra fit into the equation? Well, think about all of the features that launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and imagine them on much larger screens. Circle to Search is here, along with Sketch to Image, Smart Select, and even “AI-based Dialogue Boost.”</p>
<h2 id="new-year-mostly-same-design-2">New year, (mostly) same design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oEpb3ckduFfXMxuDfqquaQ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cameras-s-pen-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra S Pen and Cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oEpb3ckduFfXMxuDfqquaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When looking at the hardware, you would be hard-pressed to be able to tell the difference between last year’s models and these new ones. The dimensions aren’t exactly identical, but they are pretty darn close.</p><p>The first semi-noticeable difference comes in the form of the Anti-Reflective display, which was first introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Unfortunately, it’s something that’s rather difficult to capture on camera when you’re in a room surrounded by overhead key lights. However, I did notice that depending on the angle, the glare coming off of the screen wasn’t <em>as bad</em> compared to looking at the Galaxy S24 FE or my own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. </p><p>It’s not like this should really come as much of a surprise, but Samsung still makes some of the most vibrant displays that I’ve ever laid eyes on. That trend continues with the Tab S10 Ultra, and I can only presume this will also be the case with the Tab S10 Plus. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to see or use the smaller of the two, leaving me wondering if Samsung simply cares more about the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides that, we have the same array of buttons around the frame, along with the quad-speaker array, and USB-C charging port on the bottom. On the back, both the Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra offer dual rear cameras, with the magnetic S Pen strip placed just to the left.</p><p>While it’s definitely possible, it’s also a bit comical when you pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with one hand. It’s really not designed for this, but chances are you won’t be standing in the middle of a crowded room trying to hold it with one hand while using the S Pen with the other. </p><p>Then again, if you’re using a 14.6-inch tablet, chances are that you won’t be trying to use it with just one hand. This brings us to the keyboard case, which is an area of some disappointment. </p>
<h2 id="new-but-old-keyboard-case-2">New, but old, keyboard case</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kikB59qQzKXw4sb5dFvwrT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-ai-key-1.jpg" alt="Galaxy AI key on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kikB59qQzKXw4sb5dFvwrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I mentioned before, Samsung is serious about trying to get everyone and anyone using Galaxy AI. Seemingly following in the footsteps of Microsoft with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-copilot-key-pc-keyboard-announcement-2024">Windows Copilot button</a>, there’s a new Galaxy AI button on the keyboard. I’m not sure if it was the intended function, but when pressed, the Google Gemini app would appear. </p><p>It’s possible this was just for today’s demonstration, but I’m also curious as to where Bixby plays a role in all of this. Nevertheless, it’s not all that surprising to see, especially considering that the Copilot has been implemented on practically every Windows laptop released this year. </p><p>One thing I did notice when looking at the Tab S10 Plus and Ultra product page is that it seems that the “new” Book Cover Keyboard might actually be compatible with the Tab S9 Plus and S9 Ultra. This was one of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">big gripes</a> when going from the Tab S8 Ultra to the Tab S9 Ultra, so maybe Samsung is actually listening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-side-profile-in-case.jpg" alt="Side profile view of Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Book Cover Keyboard is backward compatible, that’s great for Tab S9 Plus and Ultra owners. What isn’t great is that it didn’t feel like much else had been done to improve the overall design. The last two iterations have been great when using them on a desk or a rigid surface, but things immediately <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">begin to fall apart</a> when using the Book Cover Keyboard on your lap. </p><p>I didn’t have the opportunity to sit back on a couch and use the Keyboard, so it’s something I’m looking forward to testing out when it’s time for a review. At this point, I’m not sure what other direction Samsung could go in, save for just “borrowing” Apple’s iPad Pro Smart Keyboard design. </p>
<h2 id="a-big-surprise-2">A big surprise</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NomFtENrt2o622kREhNw3Q" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-processor-presentation.jpg" alt="MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus on the Galaxy Tab S10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NomFtENrt2o622kREhNw3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3136" height="1764" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another surprise was that Samsung opted against using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in its flagship tablet lineup. Instead, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>, paired with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of expandable storage. Speaking of which, kudos to Samsung for continuing to include a microSD card slot with its tablets, even if I still believe it should’ve never been removed from Galaxy phones.</p><p>Anyways, Samsung claims the Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC provides an 18% boost in CPU performance, 28% better GPU performance, and 14% improved NPU performance. All of that is paired with a “Larger Vapor Chamber,” in an effort to cut on the potential for overheating. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wasn’t able to really “put this to the test” in my brief time with the Tab S10 Ultra, but everything felt as snappy as I expected. If anything, I did notice that loading into the “classic” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> mode seemed faster than I thought, something that was echoed by others at the event. </p><p>The decision to move from Qualcomm to MediaTek for its flagship tablets had to have been for a good reason. But, it was interesting to see three new Samsung Galaxy devices announced, none of which are being powered by a Snapdragon chip.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK9hDfZuHLUXcWT2CgtK4Y" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hdr-video-playback-2.jpg" alt="HDR VIdeo Playback on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK9hDfZuHLUXcWT2CgtK4Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All-in-all, I’m not really disappointed that Samsung stuck to a slightly tweaked design, and even saying that surprises me. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the poster child for premium Android tablets, and there’s really not much that can compete in this price bracket. </p><p>With hardware that’s already refined, Samsung is doing exactly what I expected, as it’s putting more of a focus on software. More importantly, it’s all about Galaxy AI and Samsung looking to find ways for its customers to actually make use of these features. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With the exception of the Galaxy S22, we’ve seen Samsung release a Fan Edition of its flagship smartphone every year since 2020. Back then, the FE was seen as a “flagship killer” of sorts, offering incredible value compared to the “regular” Galaxy devices. Last year’s Galaxy S23 FE was no exception, but I’m not sure if the same can be said about the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><p>Understandably, Samsung cut corners in different areas, while simultaneously sprinkling in some of the same features and specs shared by the Galaxy S24 FE’s more expensive counterpart. To be frank, after spending some time with Samsung’s latest phone, I came away feeling a bit confused. </p>
<h2 id="the-galaxy-s24-fe-looks-really-familiar-xa0-2">The Galaxy S24 FE looks really familiar </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-colors-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/inn2brzTWTMaKiHcFYu3UA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s get some of the basics out of the way. Samsung slimmed down the bezels a bit, resulting in the S24 FE sporting a 6.7-inch display. This matches up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> while being 0.3 inches larger than the S23 FE. Samsung’s Dynamic AMOLED makes its return, offering a 120Hz refresh rate, and is HDR10+ compliant. However, in a year where one of the focuses seems to be on making screens brighter, the S24 FE is no different, as it’s capable of reaching up to 1900 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Much like the Galaxy Tab S10 series, it’s difficult to really notice any differences between the S24 FE and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">S23 FE</a>. Making matters even more confusing, good luck trying to tell the S24 FE apart from even the S24 Plus from earlier this year. There are some very minor differences in dimensions, not to mention the variances in color options, but again, from an appearance standpoint, it’s pretty darn similar. </p><p>I bring this up because it’s part of the reason why I’m confused about Samsung’s direction. Sure, these two phones aren’t <em>actually</em> the same, even if they share many similarities. Which, by the way, includes the S24 FE “borrowing” the 50MP primary camera from the Plus. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good thing to see, it just continues to leave me scratching my head. </p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-difference-2">The biggest difference</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2759px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Co8gKBVaf3LT6mpvsXUMNH" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on-exynos-2400e.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos 2400e for Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Co8gKBVaf3LT6mpvsXUMNH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2759" height="1552" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I’ve mentioned, there are differences to be found, but you won’t see them at first glance. The biggest change is Samsung making the switch away from Qualcomm, but instead of opting for a MediaTek chip, Samsung’s own Exynos 2400e is at the helm with the S24 FE. This is paired with 8GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, just like the S23 FE, but offering less RAM than the S24 Plus.</p><p>Although it might come as a surprise to those of us here in the U.S., the reality is that this isn’t anything new for Samsung phones. In regions and markets outside of the States, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus are powered by the Exynos 2400. At the end of the day, the only thing between the Exynos 2400 and 2400e, is that Samsung lowered the clock speeds of the latter by 100MHz (3.21GHz vs. 3.11GHz.) </p>
<h2 id="galaxy-ai-for-everyone-2">Galaxy AI for everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-generative-edit-1.jpg" alt="Generative Edit on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, Samsung continued to drive home the idea that Galaxy AI should be easily accessible and readily available for anyone and everyone. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> had their time to shine, those features are now making their way to more affordable smartphones. </p><p>You won’t find hardly any features on the S24 FE that aren’t already available on Samsung’s other 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship devices</a>. This includes the likes of Generative Edit, Portrait Studio, Instant Slow-mo, Circle to Search, and other key Galaxy AI features. </p>

<p>What remains to be seen is how the S24 FE will hold up over time, especially as Galaxy AI expands. Perhaps more importantly, I have to wonder how long it will be before we see Samsung introduce new Galaxy AI features, but leave the S24 FE behind. </p><p>It’s an important question to ask, as the Galaxy S24 FE is getting the same treatment as its more expensive counterparts. Samsung announced that its latest phone will receive seven years of software and security updates. It’s great to hear and to see on paper, but only time will really tell how much performance degradation there will be when Android 22 and One UI 13 roll out. </p>
<h2 id="the-exynos-2400e-feels-snappy-2">The Exynos 2400e feels snappy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fE5ZkSrbQBnSu2izVi3PBB" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-dual-recording-1.jpg" alt="Dual Recording on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fE5ZkSrbQBnSu2izVi3PBB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, the Galaxy S24 FE felt just as fast and snappy as you’d expect from a brand-new phone. That included messing around with some of the Galaxy AI features, such as Generative Edit, even if the end results weren’t what I expected. Then again, I kind of chalk this up to being a “victim of the environment” and don’t really put the onus on the S24 FE. </p><p>Super Slow-mo was another cool feature to see working in action, managing to easily capture and playback from someone else messing around with a Newton’s Cradle. The S24 FE never felt hot to the touch; it only felt warm because of the number of people passing their phones around to get different photos or try different things.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C9Bj3t5G8hpmE69Jtb3Sy7" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE camera viewfinder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9Bj3t5G8hpmE69Jtb3Sy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some things that we’ll just have to wait and test out, such as battery life, and putting the other Galaxy AI features through their paces. Seeing as I’m entrenched in the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">retro game emulation</a> on devices, I’m interested and excited to see whether I can use the S24 FE to enjoy some of the more modern Zelda games. </p>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-broader-picture-2">Looking at the broader picture</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EZNeT3bZfVUKMZsf63s7FL" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE with Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZNeT3bZfVUKMZsf63s7FL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so what is it about the Galaxy S24 FE that leaves me feeling confused? It all comes down to price. At retail, the S24 FE is $649.99, which would seem like a steal compared to the $999 retail price of the S24 Plus. When factoring in Samsung’s current trade-in offerings, you can get the former for $249 or the latter for $399. Again, this is a nod in the FE’s favor, as it should be. </p><p>But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">2024 holiday shopping season</a> is right around the corner, which means that you’re sure to find a deal <em>somewhere</em> for one of, if not both the S24 FE and the S24 Plus. On the one hand, the cheaper phone is probably going to be the better seller of the two. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QUvoddCA7TRFjo9FPRqPLG" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-cameras-close.jpg" alt="Close-up on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUvoddCA7TRFjo9FPRqPLG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if both phones are priced the same, would you rather have the phone that was released alongside two other flagships, or the one that’s positioned as being more budget-friendly? Not to mention that the S24 Plus does offer more RAM and storage in its base configuration, which will surely be beneficial in the long run. </p><p>I do think that there’s a place in Samsung’s portfolio for the Galaxy FE to exist. I just think that this would be a much more compelling option if the price was somewhere around $500-$550. It would make even more sense considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A33 5G</a> starts at $399, and while it seems to be a great phone and value, Samsung might be missing out on an opportunity. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/nubias-new-gaming-tablet-crushes-the-competition-with-a-premium-chipset-and-built-in-fan">REDMAGIC Nova Gaming Tablet</a> launched in China earlier this month. The tablet rocks a 10.9-inch display with a 2K resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. It also includes Qualcomm&apos;s top-of-the-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, which tops out at 3.4GHz.</p><p>According to REDMAGIC, the Nova Gaming Tablet hits an AnTuTu score of 2,352,902 and is "the only tablet capable of handling AAA games for serious gamers."</p><p>One tool to optimize REDMAGIC Nova performance is its built-in 20,000 RPM fan, a 3D heat pipe, and internal air ducts. REDMAGIC states this should "maximize cooling" as the tablet&apos;s internals dissipate heat buildup during longer gaming sessions. We&apos;ve seen similar efforts at maximizing cooling shine on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-redmagic-9-pro-launch">REDMAGIC 9 Pro</a>.</p><p>For the Nova, the company states its nine-layered cooling system and all-metal aviation body can reduce its core temperature by an estimated 25 degrees Celsius, or 77 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Additionally, the tablet packs a whopping 10,100mAh battery. REDMAGIC estimates the battery can last for nearly 19 hours; however, it might last roughly 10 hours with heavy gaming use. One slight difference is that the international variant offers an 80W charger instead of the 120W Chinese consumers received.</p><p>REDMAGIC detailed a few other specifications like a 50MP rear camera and a 20MP selfie lens. Thanks to its Game Space 9.0 software, users can seamlessly tune performance, switch graphics, and find accessory controls. The Nova Gaming Tablet is DTS:X Ultra certified, delivering "full range" 3D audio via four built-in speakers.</p><p>The REDMAGIC Nova Gaming Tablet appears to have the power and price necessary to challenge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, and we&apos;re excited to test it out! Samsung announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a> on Thursday, and that should be its main competitor.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android 15 is at the finish line, with Google set to release the stable build soon. The beta releases gave us a preview of the features coming to Google&apos;s mobile OS, and with the beta program available on dozens of other devices in addition to Pixels, it&apos;s easy to get started with it right now. </p><p>Unlike the last two Android versions, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> has plenty of interesting additions, including a notification cooldown mode, better optimization, ability to record parts of the screen, audio sharing over Bluetooth, and a slate of upgrades around foldables. </p><p>So let&apos;s take a look at what phones will make the switch to Android 15, and when your device is likely to get the update.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google"><span>Google</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the Android 15 update will hit Pixels ahead of every other device. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> or above, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a>. Obviously, Pixels will get the stable build on the day of release, and this gives Google&apos;s phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>That said, not all Pixels will upgrade to Android 15, with only the devices released in the last three years eligible to receive the build. Here&apos;s the list of Google devices that will get Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li><li>Pixel 9</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro XL</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</li></ul>
<p>If you&apos;re interested and don&apos;t want to wait until the stable release hits, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a> right now. The latest beta build doesn&apos;t have any major bugs, and is stable as a daily driver — I don&apos;t see any issues on my Pixel 8. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung"><span>Samsung</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-7.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung continues to be the largest phone manufacturer, and it releases more devices than any other phone brand. Samsung doesn&apos;t usually join the beta program at the same time as other manufacturers, instead opting to wait until it can roll out the next iteration of One UI. As the brand uses the stable Android 15 release as the base, that means you&apos;ll need to wait at least until mid-October to get your hands on the next version of Android on your Galaxy phone.</p><p>Samsung does a great job rolling out the stable update to its flagships in a timely manner, but its mid-range and budget phones don&apos;t get the same level of attention, so if you have a Galaxy A device, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 (or even Q2) 2025 to make the switch to Android 15.</p><p>These are the Samsung phones that should get the Android 15-based One UI 7 update:</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-s-series-2">Galaxy S series</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy S21</li><li>Galaxy S21+</li><li>Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Galaxy S21 FE</li><li>Galaxy S22</li><li>Galaxy S22+</li><li>Galaxy S22 Ultra</li><li>Galaxy S23</li><li>Galaxy S23+</li><li>Galaxy S23 Ultra</li><li>Galaxy S23 FE</li><li>Galaxy S24</li><li>Galaxy S24+</li><li>Galaxy S24 Ultra</li></ul>

<ul><li>Galaxy Z Flip 3</li><li>Galaxy Z Fold 3</li><li>Galaxy Z Flip 4</li><li>Galaxy Z Fold 4</li><li>Galaxy Z Flip 5</li><li>Galaxy Z Fold 5</li><li>Galaxy Z Fold 6</li><li>Galaxy Z Flip 6</li></ul>
<h2 id="galaxy-a-series-2">Galaxy A series</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy A14</li><li>Galaxy A15</li><li>Galaxy A23</li><li>Galaxy A24</li><li>Galaxy A25</li><li>Galaxy A33</li><li>Galaxy A34</li><li>Galaxy A35</li><li>Galaxy A53</li><li>Galaxy A54</li><li>Galaxy A55</li><li>Galaxy A73</li></ul>
<h2 id="galaxy-m-series-2">Galaxy M series</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy M14</li><li>Galaxy M15</li><li>Galaxy M33</li><li>Galaxy M34</li><li>Galaxy M53</li><li>Galaxy M54</li><li>Galaxy M55</li></ul>
<h2 id="galaxy-f-series-2">Galaxy F series</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy F14</li><li>Galaxy F15</li><li>Galaxy F34</li><li>Galaxy F54</li></ul>
<p>Samsung tends to prioritize its current devices over others, so it is likely that the beta update will be limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series when it goes live. Select Galaxy A devices also got beta builds last year, and we&apos;ll have to wait and see if the Galaxy A55 joins the list this time around.</p><p>As always, the list is a tentative guideline based on Samsung&apos;s update guarantee; while all the devices mentioned above should receive Android 15, there&apos;s no telling if that will be the case until Samsung confirms it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus"><span>OnePlus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K" name="oneplus-12-30.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island next to OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used to do a good job with updates, but it fumbled recent platform updates, leading to device-breaking bugs and lingering connectivity issues. And because the manufacturer uses ColorOS in all but name, it doesn&apos;t have much control over when it gets to roll out updates.</p><p>These OnePlus phones will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro</li><li>OnePlus 10T</li><li>OnePlus 10R/10R 150W</li><li>OnePlus 11</li><li>OnePlus 11R</li><li>OnePlus 12</li><li>OnePlus 12R</li><li>OnePlus Open</li><li>OnePlus Nord 3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus continues to just roll out a single update to its Nord N series of devices sold in North America, so even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> launched last year, it won&apos;t be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Considering how bad OnePlus was at delivering timely updates, I&apos;m not going to share any estimated timelines — this time, I&apos;ll wait until my devices get the stable Android 15 update before writing about it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-7-best-new-features-in-oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> is in a decent state now, but that wasn&apos;t the case during the beta — or even the initial stable builds. So if you have a OnePlus phone, I&apos;d suggest waiting and seeing if the stable update has any issues before installing it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo"><span>OPPO</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-27.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO is doing a much better job with platform updates in general, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-flip-review">Find N2 Flip</a> picked up the stable Android 14 update before the end of 2023 — a sizeable achievement. With ColorOS 15 set to debut this year, it is likely we&apos;ll see a similar update cadence as last year.</p><p>OPPO guarantees four platform updates to its high-end phones, with its mid-range devices getting three updates. These are the OPPO phones that will get the Android 15-based ColorOS 15:</p>
<ul><li>OPPO Find X5</li><li>OPPO Find X5 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X6</li><li>OPPO Find X6 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X7</li><li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra</li><li>OPPO Find N2</li><li>OPPO Find N3</li><li>OPPO Find N2 Flip</li><li>OPPO Find N3 Flip</li><li>OPPO Reno 9</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro+</li><li>OPPO Reno 10</li><li>OPPO Reno 10 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11</li><li>OPPO Reno 11 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11F</li><li>OPPO F25 Pro</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo"><span>Vivo</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8" name="vivo-x100-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Pro next to iQOO 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to OPPO, Vivo is delivering updates at a faster pace than previous years. And in Funtouch OS 14, the Chinese manufacturer has an interface that actually looks modern. Outside of that, Vivo continues to launch a lot of phones, with the V series getting a new model every six months.</p><p>As is the case with ColorOS, Vivo is unlikely to roll out an Android 15 build until Funtouch OS 15 is available, so devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a> won&apos;t be able to switch to Android 15 until early 2025. </p><p>That said, these are the Vivo phones that will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Vivo X80</li><li>Vivo X80 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro+</li><li>Vivo X90s</li><li>Vivo X100</li><li>Vivo X100 Pro</li><li>Vivo X Fold</li><li>Vivo X Fold+</li><li>Vivo X Fold 2</li><li>Vivo X Flip</li><li>Vivo V27</li><li>Vivo V27 Pro</li><li>Vivo V27e</li><li>Vivo V29</li><li>Vivo V29 Pro</li><li>Vivo V29e</li><li>Vivo V30</li><li>Vivo V30 Pro</li><li>Vivo V40</li><li>Vivo V40 Pro</li></ul>
<p>As iQOO is basically a Vivo sub-brand, I&apos;m including its devices in the same list:</p>
<ul><li>iQOO 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10</li><li>iQOO 10 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10T</li><li>iQOO 11</li><li>iQOO 11 Pro</li><li>iQOO 12</li><li>iQOO Neo 7</li><li>iQOO Neo 7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 8</li><li>iQOO Neo 8 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 9</li><li>iQOO Neo 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7</li><li>iQOO Z7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7s</li><li>iQOO Z8x</li></ul>

<p>Honor is making a lot of progress in global markets, and the brand&apos;s ability to deliver standout devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> have allowed it to distinguish itself against its immediate rivals. While MagicOS 8.0 brings a lot of welcome additions, it still isn&apos;t quite as polished as other Chinese interfaces. Honor is instead leaning into AI, and it has a few unique features that are great to use.</p><p>Honor doesn&apos;t have a beta program as such, and the brand takes its time in rolling out stable updates to its devices. So if you have any of the phones listed below, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 2025 to get Android 15. With that out of the way, these are the Honor phones getting Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Honor Magic 5</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Lite</li><li>Honor Magic 6</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro RSR</li><li>Honor Magic Vs</li><li>Honor Magic V2</li><li>Honor Magic V2 RSR</li><li>Honor Magic V3</li><li>Honor 90</li><li>Honor 90 Pro</li><li>Honor 90 Lite</li><li>Honor X50</li><li>Honor X50 Pro</li><li>Honor X50 GT</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus"><span>ASUS</span></h2>
<p>ASUS continues to be obstinate when it comes to platform updates, and the brand only guarantees two Android OS updates even though its devices have powerful hardware. This is the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, an otherwise great device that is hobbled by a shortsighted update policy.</p><p>Therefore, there are only six ASUS devices that will make the switch to Android 15, and three of those phones launched in 2024: </p>
<ul><li>ROG Phone 8</li><li>ROG Phone 8 Pro</li><li>ROG Phone 7</li><li>ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</li><li>Zenfone 10</li><li>Zenfone 11 Ultra</li></ul>

<p>Nothing is a relatively small brand, but it is doing the right things when it comes to software updates. All of the four devices in its portfolio — including the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> — will get three platform updates, and while it isn&apos;t quick to roll out updates, the fact that it is delivering the same update guarantee to its budget phone is a big deal.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-27.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most major phone manufacturers do a great job rolling out timely updates, but that still isn&apos;t the case with Xiaomi. In the last three years, Xiaomi phones were the last to receive platform updates, and I don&apos;t see that changing in 2024. Like its Chinese rivals, Xiaomi now guarantees four platform updates to its high-end and select mid-range phones, but it doesn&apos;t make any promises as to <em>when</em> it will roll out those updates.</p><p>This is frustrating if you&apos;re using a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>; the device has the best camera package available today, and while the software is fluid and has good customizability, I&apos;m unwilling to bet on the phone picking up Android 15 before the end of the year. As for the update itself, the Xiaomi 12 series and above will switch to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Xiaomi 12</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Lite</li><li>Xiaomi 12S Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 13</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 14</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 2</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 3</li><li>Xiaomi 12T</li><li>Xiaomi 12T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13T</li><li>Xiaomi 13T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14T</li><li>Xiaomi 14T Pro</li></ul>
<p>Redmi devices make up an overwhelming majority of Xiaomi&apos;s sales, but the brand uses an underhanded tactic where it doesn&apos;t launch these devices with the current version of Android. It&apos;s this strategy that makes it so hard to recommend a recent Redmi device; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12</a> series launched in Q1 2023 with Android 12 out of the box, six months after Android 13 became available. As such, these devices will not be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 series</a> debuted with Android 13 in February 2024, and this measure is to ensure that the devices don&apos;t get updated beyond Android 15. Therefore, the actual list of Redmi devices getting to Android 15 is a tiny minority:</p>
<ul><li>Redmi 12</li><li>Redmi Note 12 4G</li><li>Redmi Note 12R</li><li>Redmi Note 12T Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro+</li><li>Redmi K70</li><li>Redmi K70 Pro</li><li>Redmi K70E</li></ul>
<p>POCO is in a similar situation, and last year&apos;s X5 and X5 Pro won&apos;t get Android 15. These are the POCO devices that will get MIUI 15 based on Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>POCO F5</li><li>POCO F5 Pro</li><li>POCO X6</li><li>POCO X6 Pro</li><li>POCO X6 Neo</li><li>POCO M6</li><li>POCO M6 Pro</li><li>POCO C65</li></ul>

<p>Motorola changed its update policy, and the brand now rolls out three platform updates to most of its phones. Of course, that&apos;s limited to select mid-range and flagship devices, with its entry-level phones only getting one update. Also, when those updates show up is an altogether different matter — the brand isn&apos;t anywhere as fast as its rivals at rolling out version updates.</p>

<p>As always, I&apos;m closely monitoring the progress of Android 15, and will share any details as and when brands officially announce them. Based on previous years, Samsung is likely to kickstart its beta program a few weeks after Google rolls out the stable release, and other brands will follow suit. </p><p>And as for the stable builds, the Pixels should switch over to Android 15 by mid-October, with recent estimates suggesting that&apos;s when Google will roll out the stable release. After that, I&apos;m estimating an eventual rollout by the end of Q4 to select flagships by Samsung, OPPO, Vivo, and OnePlus. </p>

While most smartphone makers appear to follow Apple or Samsung when deciding on the color palette of their new devices, everyone and their grandma seems to be following Motorola&apos;s blazing hot pink <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> these days.</p><p>A lot of people (including me) lost their minds when the first pink Pixel 9 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">spotted in the wild</a>, and we were even more excited when the matching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> made its debut next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series. Any time you spot a pink Pixel, you immediately know that it&apos;s a 9 series Pixel because of the shade alone.</p><p>The boldest new color variant in any smartphone lineup sets the mood for that launch, eventually becoming the signifier for that series. For example, the Kinda Coral <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> was a brave new hue and it ended up becoming the signature shade for Pixels of that era.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z5GEEg9KEDLvj59JCdwdXQ" name="pink-android-phones-collage-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Collage of various pink Android phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5GEEg9KEDLvj59JCdwdXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And guess what? Apple just released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16 series</a>, and sure enough, there&apos;s a pink option that we can buy. We&apos;re not talking about Apple&apos;s usual subtle or rose gold hues, the iPhone 16 is unapologetically, irrevocably, very loudly and proudly pink. I don&apos;t know about you, but I wasn&apos;t shocked at all.</p><p>Before Google and Apple, though, Samsung brought pastel pink to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Even HMD, the owner of Nokia, has joined in on the fun with the blushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a>. But despite all these big brands jumping on the pink phone bandwagon, none of them started the trend. The credit for that, in my eyes, goes to Motorola.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong—pink phones existed before the Razr Plus 2024. Samsung launched the S21 series and the Z Flip 5 in pastel pinks. But Motorola&apos;s story with the shade goes way back and is far more iconic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PjXi38jD3Zt9kLQ5fjYvEK" name="iphone-16-pink-and-ultramarine.jpg" alt="Two iPhone 16 units in pink and ultramarine held in two hands." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjXi38jD3Zt9kLQ5fjYvEK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Jacob Krol)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Turn the clock back to the early 2000s, when Motorola was at the top of its game. Every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">modern-day foldable</a> has the original Razr flip phone to thank for its existence. The Razr was the coolest phone on the block back in the day. It became even more iconic when reality TV star Paris Hilton became the poster girl for the Razr, rocking one in a hot pink shade.</p><p>Fast forward to today, 20 years after the RAZR V3, and Motorola has come full circle. The brand invited Paris Hilton to don a hot pink Razr once more to honor the legendary flip phone that started it all. Hilton was a key figure at the Razr Plus 2024 launch event, inviting waves of nostalgia for so many of us.</p><p>The Razr 5G came in a subtle Blush Gold option, followed by a deep Viva Magenta offering for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>. But while this isn&apos;t Motorola&apos;s first pink foldable, the Razr Plus 2024 is the first <em>proper</em> pink foldable, and I think it&apos;s the perfect time to reintroduce this iconic coat of paint. With the launch of the Razr Plus 2024, Motorola has overtaken Samsung to reprise its role as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-foldable-phone">best flip phone</a> maker in the biz. I couldn&apos;t imagine anything better than this to encapsulate the meaning of a hot pink Razr.</p>

<p>I was curious to hear Motorola&apos;s side of this color story, so I reached out to them. Here&apos;s what Maria Jose Martin, director of North America Marketing at Motorola, had to say about the significance of a hot pink Razr.</p><p>"The original RAZR V3 established pink as a fashionable and desirable colorway for smartphones, and has since then always been closely associated with Motorola and the Razr," she commented, talking about the inception of the pink Razr. "This year, 20 years after the original Razr launch, we were incredibly excited to bring back the Razr in all of its iconic hot pink glory — alongside Paris Hilton, of course!"</p><p>Sharing some insight on Motorola&apos;s inspiration behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">Razr 2024 Plus color options</a>, this rather loud pink colorway, and the decision to bring the iconic hue back now, she said that smartphones are more than just tech these days; they’re vessels for self-expression.</p><p>The brand aimed to establish an emotional connection with consumers and felt that hot pink would naturally be associated with the original Razr. This bold and trendy color choice also offers users an opportunity to express their individuality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These days, smartphones are more than just tech, they’re vessels for self-expression.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When asked about the color and how it connects to the roots of the Razr lineup, Martin went on to give a very in-depth response.</p><p>"The original RAZR V3 was one of the first devices to become a cultural icon. In the early 2000s, having a Razr was a fashion statement, and a status symbol for the era&apos;s top celebrities and &apos;cool kids.&apos; However, the device was never just an accessory - it brought technological innovations of its time and truly bridged the gap between fashion and technology."</p><p>I love the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">Motorola is aware of the nostalgia factor</a>. In its own way, the brand is paying homage to its older fans, while attracting a whole new generation of users with more vivacious color options. It is a lovely sentiment and I hope that Motorola continues to dance to the beat of its own drum.</p>

The phone had an incredible set of cameras with unique tuning, a gorgeous design, and reliable hardware. The P30 Pro positioned Huawei as a leading Android manufacturer, and it felt like the brand was poised for great things.</p><p>Of course, the U.S. trade ban effectively put a halt to that, and while Huawei is still delivering great phones — the Pura 70 Ultra is a terrific showcase, and the insane tri-fold design is quintessential Huawei — the restrictions have hobbled the brand&apos;s global progress.</p>

<p>This is where Honor comes in. The brand started out in 2013 as a Huawei sub-brand aimed at a younger audience — much like POCO is to Xiaomi — and it picked up a sizeable market share thanks to its budget-focused designs. Honor was similarly affected by the U.S. ban, but it split away from Huawei at the end of 2020, and is now controlled by a Chinese consortium.</p><p>The split allowed Honor access to Google services once again, and it used that to good effect, swiftly rising up the ranks in the intervening three years and making decent inroads outside China, a sizeable achievement considering it doesn&apos;t have access to Huawei&apos;s marketing might any longer. While Honor focused on budget devices under Huawei, it is now squarely positioned at the premium segment, and more importantly, it is delivering exciting designs that stand out from the pack.</p><p>Chinese brands consistently push the boundaries of hardware design, whether that&apos;s retractable camera modules, phones with screens mounted on sliding rails — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-xiaomi-mi-mix-3-us">Xiaomi Mi Mix 3</a> — or foldables. Yes, Samsung beat its Chinese rivals by debuting foldables ahead of everyone else, but all the best innovations in this area are coming from Chinese manufacturers.</p>

<p>Whether it&apos;s Vivo with an ultra-sleek design and dual fingerprint sensors housed inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a>, or the insane <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">tri-fold design that Huawei just introduced</a>, there hasn&apos;t been any shortage of innovative ideas of late. The most exciting foldable I used this year is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>; it is even thinner than last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and the design removes a lot of the pain points associated with foldables — the device is just as thin and light as a regular phone.</p><p>Honor has one of the strongest camera packages on a foldable, the best battery life, and the best displays. The manufacturer&apos;s efforts with PWM dimming and ensuring its devices have flicker-free panels give it a sizeable advantage, and the Magic V3&apos;s Defocus Display is terrific — as my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Nick Sutrich pointed out</a>.</p><p>It isn&apos;t just foldables either; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> continues to be one of the best phones around, and the recently-unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">MagicPad 2 tablet</a> brings an OLED panel to the mid-range segment. Honor&apos;s strategy to focus on premium devices is an outlier; most Chinese brands turn to the budget segment to build overseas market share, and it&apos;s good to see Honor not going down that route. </p>

<p>The biggest criticism I can level at Honor is the software; MagicOS needs a visual refresh, as it still has legacy EMUI underpinnings. The recent MagicOS 8.0.1 build shows positive signs in this area, with Honor turning to a slew of AI-assisted features to differentiate its software and teaming up with Google. I&apos;m ambivalent towards generative AI, but a lot of the features available on the Magic V3 are actually usable and not just gimmicky, and that in itself is a big deal.</p><p>Honor is doing a terrific job taking on Huawei&apos;s mantle in the high-end segment, and I can&apos;t wait to see what the brand has in store for 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently sent emails to Pixel Buds owners, detailing a coming update that will add Gemini's AI smarts to the small devices.</li><li>Gemini will be offered as an alternative to the standard Assistant for hands-free, personalized help when needed.</li><li>The update will also change the "Hey Google" voice command, which will soon function based on your phone's settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest AI model is preparing to slide into Assistant&apos;s turf and do more for you when you&apos;re working or on the go.</p><p>The company started sending emails out to Pixel Buds owners this week, highlighting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini&apos;s</a> upcoming addition to the earbuds (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/google-gemini-is-coming-to-all-pixel-buds/">9to5Google</a>). Android Central has also received this email, which states users can leverage Gemini&apos;s assistance if it&apos;s been set as the "default" helper on their phone. Google warns that some features "may work differently" if Gemini is chosen over the Assistant.</p><p>Moreover, Google states, "Your Android phone needs to be unlocked and connected to your Pixel Buds while you’re wearing them." The email adds that this prevents the necessity of constantly unlocking your phone whenever you want to talk to Gemini. Additionally, if your buds are disconnected from your phone, you will lose Gemini&apos;s hands-free assistance.</p><p>Users can get around that by altering the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7685360?utm_source=msa&utm_campaign=GS204129&utm_medium=email_service&utm_content=110854178&utm_term=oneunlock">Only Require One Unlock</a>" option in your Pixel Buds&apos; assistant settings. What&apos;s more, Google states Gemini does not recognize the "On Headphones" option in the "Personal results" settings. However, the standard Google Assistant will still adhere to that setting.</p><p>The company is also changing how the "Hey Google" command will work for the Pixel Buds. Google states your "Hey Google" settings on your phone will now control whether the AI can assist you via your Pixel Buds. This will reportedly affect Gemini alongside the regular Assistant.</p><p>The publication states the updates bringing Gemini and "Hey Google" command changes involve the Pixel Buds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>, and the Pixel Buds A-series.</p>

<p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> in August and those tiny devices feature a rich integration with Gemini. Shifting the rest of the Pixel Buds lineup toward Gemini seems like an expected approach — especially since it&apos;s been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">moving in on the Assistant everywhere else</a>.</p><p>In other news, the notification capabilities of the original Pixel Buds Pro went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">some turbulent times</a> recently, as detailed by user reports. Users attempting to have the Assistant read out their notifications were met with an error and a lack of audible information. This was concerning the device&apos;s touch-and-hold capability.</p><p>The Assistant informed users that they would need to say "Hey Google, read notifications" aloud if they needed such information. After questioning, Google confirmed to Android Central that the change would remain as it was done based on user feedback. The press-and-hold function will no longer work, but it now seems like the change was in light of bigger plans.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazfit has permanently discounted the Helio Ring to $199 and made its two hidden subscriptions free to all new and existing Helio Ring owners, eliminating one of our biggest complaints about the smart ring.</p><p>Amazfit claimed at launch that the Helio Ring had "no subscriptions required," which we called "disingenuous" in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring review </a>because certain sleep insights, fitness summaries, and chatbot conversations did require expensive subscriptions. </p><p>"We heard the feedback and are now offering all of the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness features to new and existing ring users for free, for life," an Amazfit rep told us on Thursday.</p><p>Zepp Aura will assess possible issues like sleep apnea, insomnia, and general sleepiness while analyzing your Helio Ring sleep data, as well as offer wellness coaching and an "AI audio engine" that plays relaxing music through your phone for better sleep. The Zepp Fitness sub lets you see in-depth weekly or monthly Fitness Reports and a fitness-focused chatbot to help you with your training.</p><p>Combined, the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness subs cost $100/year with annual passes, more than the $70 annual fee for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> membership. Now, Helio Ring owners will get these tools for free.</p><p>We&apos;ve asked Amazfit if Helio Ring owners who previously subscribed to Zepp Aura or Fitness will get a refund or rebate. <strong>[Update]</strong> Amazfit confirmed to us that "Current Helio owners with an active Aura or Fitness subscription can apply for a refund," or cancel the subscription in the Play Store or iOS Settings if you&apos;re still in the trial period.</p><p>To get a refund, Android users can follow the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en">Google Play refund instructions</a>; iOS users can follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to the Oura Ring ($300–550 + $6/month subscription), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> ($399), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a> ($299), and most other smart rings we&apos;ve tested, the Amazfit Helio Ring ($199) is now significantly more affordable. It still has other issues like short battery life and limited ring size options, but they&apos;re easier to swallow at this price point.</p><p>Amazfit also announced that it&apos;ll launch the new version of its Zepp app on October 14, available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit watch</a> and ring owners. It&apos;ll have "an entirely new and improved redesign," along with new features like a workout exertion score and a health monitoring section.</p><p>Specific to health monitoring, the Zepp app will lump together key stats like physical/mental recovery, RHR, HRV, deep sleep total, exertion load, and training status and warn you which stats "need attention." If everything is where it should be, the Health Monitor will say you&apos;re "Within Range" in the main Today view.</p><p>The lower price, combined with this Zepp app revamp, have us more optimistic about the Amazfit Helio Ring as a budget smart ring option, even if plenty of people will pay extra for other brands.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed a few updates preparing to arrive for Google Maps, like an expansion of Street View and sharper satellite imagery thanks to AI.</li><li>Google Maps users will find improved Street View imagery for nearly 80 countries.</li><li>Those in Google Earth on the web will soon experience "historical imagery," which lets users go back roughly 80 years to see how the planet and cities have changed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing a few updates for Google Maps and Google Earth that may help users understand the ever-changing world.</p><p>Kicking off the changes is an update to Street View on Google Maps. The company detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/earth/3-imagery-updates-to-google-earth-and-maps/">Keyword post</a> that users can expect to find "new imagery" in nearly 80 countries. This expansion in Google Maps brings better virtual adventures to places like Bosnia, Nambia, Liechtenstein, Paraguay, and more.</p><p>The company&apos;s cars and trekkers were stated to utilize a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/street-view-15-new-features/">new camera technology</a>, which it first revealed in 2022. With the ability to mount on any vehicle, Google states it&apos;s made creating better Street View imagery a breeze in more places. The company will continue to update Maps&apos; Street View for better virtual insight into countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and more.</p><p>The Street View expansion launched on September 25, meaning users should keep their eyes peeled.</p><p>Google&apos;s update also focuses on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-google-earth-whats-difference">Google Earth</a>. The company states its users will soon have an easier time turning back the clock on a portion of the planet. A new "historical imagery" feature will soon become available on Google Earth&apos;s web version.</p><p>Users will find around 80 years of stored "satellite and aerial imagery" of the planet&apos;s geography to understand the changes it experienced. While 80 years ago from 2024 pits us in the 1940s, Google states some places will send you back to the 30s — like London, Berlin, or Paris.</p><p>Alongside this update for users, Google states researchers and companies will soon gain custom map creation. Projects will also be displayed directly on the Google Earth homepage to improve collaboration efforts.</p>

<p>Lastly, images viewed in Google Maps and Earth will benefit from sharper quality, courtesy of AI. The post states users can expect to see sharper imagery in both apps "this week" due to its Cloud Score Plus AI. The software can better recognize clouds, mist, fog, and haze while keeping the earth&apos;s weather patterns consistent.</p><p>Over the summer, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">a major U overhaul for Android</a> users that brought a "sheet-based" style. This new style gives users more agency over the information they see on their display to ensure they don&apos;t miss what&apos;s important. Of course, Google plans to plug more AI into Maps to assist with finding locations with pre-made questions and the option to write your own.</p><p>Other updates like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wildfire-alerts-europe-africa-expansion">wildfire alerts</a> arrived in July for Maps and Search. The feature piggybacks off satellites and Google&apos;s AI models to display the range and intensity of a wildfire so users can get to safety in time.</p>
