                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>After a year with the amazing Onyx Boox Palma, I was looking forward to seeing a big Black Friday sale so I could recommend it as the go-to e-reader this holiday season. Unfortunately, Amazon only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Mobile-ePaper-G-Sensor/dp/B0CHF746JZ/"><strong>slashed the price by 12%</strong></a>, meaning it's not much cheaper than the Boox Palma 2 that just came out.</p><p>While I normally would recommend picking up a year-old device for a great discount, the Palma 2 is the better buy even though it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Palma-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DGLJD69S/">currently $279</a>. How does this make any sense? Simply put, newer can be <em>notably</em> better in the world of cheap e-readers for a few hidden reasons, most of all is software support.</p><p>The Boox Palma 2 runs Android 13 while the original Palma is still on Android 11 and likely won't get updated to anything newer. Aside from some nice new features, that means the Palma 2 can run apps for at least two years longer than the original Palma because there's going to be a point where apps no longer support Android 11. Considering apps are THE reason to pick a Boox over other e-readers, this is enough for me to recommend the newer unit.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're looking to give your eyes a rest from your phone's harsh display, or you just want a more pocketable e-reader that's capable of running full Android apps.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You only read books through Amazon's Kindle service. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P"><strong>cheaper Kindles</strong></a> that are less than half the price of this.</p><p>I called the original Onyx Boox Palma "the perfect bedtime device" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">in my review</a>, and the second iteration improves the experience in a few small ways. Onyx didn't try to reinvent the wheel or radically alter the experience for the Palma 2, but it did include a faster processor, better speakers, and a fingerprint reader nestled in the power button.</p><p>The processor improvement makes everyday computing a little quicker and just generally improves the overall experience. Onyx also added a few extra new features to the device including an AI assistant that can answer questions, keeping your phone in your pocket (or in a cabinet) while you stay as distraction-free as possible.</p><p>The Palma 2 features the same amazing super fast refresh e-ink display as the original, which means it's perfect for scrolling through web pages, books, and plenty of other apps without having that classic e-reader refresh jank. Plus, it's super friendly on the eyes with no nasty PWM dimming or flickering backlight.</p><p>And while the Palma 2 is certainly capable of playing games, you're probably going to want to stick to crossword puzzles or Wordle-type games because it's tough to play most modern games on the black-and-white display. There's a reason the original GameBoy had simplistic games, so stick to those if you really want that from this device.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need a new Chromebook, but prefer to have a premium tablet that doubles as a laptop.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook with more RAM and storage, or if you want to enjoy the variety of Chromebook Plus features.</p>
<p>This deal is for the base model, which includes 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-duet-gen-9-11-inch-mediatek/len101l0047">8GB/256GB version</a> isn't discounted, we suspect that might change at any time.</p><p>Ever since Lenovo released the original Chromebook Duet, the company has largely dominated the ChromeOS tablet space. While there have been a few competitors here and there, none of them have really been able to match up to the Duet line.</p><p>With this latest release, the MediaTek Kompanio 838 handles the heavy lifting, while still being efficient enough to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Chromebook Duet 11</a> last for up to 12 hours on a single charge. And while it might not carry the "Chromebook Plus" moniker, the Duet 11 still provides plenty of power to handle your daily workload.</p><p>The only major downside to this deal is that while you get the Folio Cover and keyboard, this specific bundle doesn't include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/stylus-pens-and-supplies/pens/4x81q72383">Lenovo USI Pen 2</a>. On the bright side, the Chromebook Duet 11 is compatible with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">best USI pens</a>, so even if you don't already have one, it's easy to get a stylus for your new Chromebook.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a fast, reliable smartwatch with great features and loads of battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;d prefer a smartwatch from a bigger name like Samsung or Google; your daily routine relies heavily on Google Assistant.</p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-ticwatch-smartwatches">best Ticwatch</a> that money can buy today, the biggest selling point of the Pro 5 is probably its incredible battery life. With Mobvoi&apos;s proprietary Essential Mode feature, you can personalize your watch&apos;s battery life to conserve energy for when you need it the most. Essential Mode drops the watch into ultra-low power settings that still give you access to the most crucial information, such as the time, date, heart rate tracking, and more. It&apos;s the kind of innovative feature that we hope to see on more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in the future. </p><p>Of course, like any device, the Ticwatch Pro 5 isn&apos;t perfect. There&apos;s no onboard Google Assistant support, for one, and the design may be a bit bulky if you have a smaller wrist. But still, if you&apos;re in the market for a new smartwatch this holiday season, 40% off the Ticwatch Pro 5 is a deal worth considering. </p>

<p>The biggest selling point for the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is that it's the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus model currently available. It measures 11.8mm thin, just a smidge thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (when folded.)</p><p>Once you lift the lid, you're presented with a beautiful 15.6-inch AMOLED display, complete with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. It's no slouch in the power department either, as its powered by the Intel Core 3 100U SoC, paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>

<p>Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that this is the first Chromebook to be released with the brand-new Quick Insert key. This replaces the "Everything" key found on every other Chromebook and makes it easy to access various files or interact with Gemini without needing to switch apps or Chrome tabs.</p><p>If there's one thing that kind of bugs me about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, it's that there aren't any other configurations to choose from. This means that if you want more RAM or storage, you're just out of luck. Even still, it doesn't take away from the overall experience.</p>

<p>The latest rumor says that the company is about to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-pursues-in-house-developed-phone-chip-report">start making its own chips</a>, which is a great idea. It would allow the company to make chips that do what it needs to do better than an off-the-shelf solution ever could. It's what we see from Apple and Google, and it works very well.</p><p>There's one more reason why Xiaomi can go its own way here: it doesn't rely on North American carriers to sell its phones so it doesn't have to build phones that use a chip and a network that were designed to <em>only</em> work best when paired with each other. The bulk of the company's sales are in Asia where things are a bit more general when it comes to network tech and customizations. Building its own chip is a win all around.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">an industry leader</a> when it comes to making chips for smart things, especially when those chips need to connect to the outside world. The company has worked hard to develop and manufacture products that are best-in-class when used with other equipment designed to work the same way.</p><p>Chances are you're in the U.S. or Canada because that's where the bulk of Android Central's web traffic comes from. Your phone almost certainly has a Qualcomm processor inside of it. There's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Qualcomm thought ahead when it came to designing a cellular modem. The company builds great products and holds patents that have changed the mobile landscape when it comes to phones, but it also works to make sure the chips powering other things — like equipment used by your phone carrier — are great. too.</p><p>If you build both sides of a network you have the chance to make it work better than anything else. In North America, Qualcomm did exactly that. Whether you use Rogers, AT&T, or T-Mobile, a Qualcomm-powered phone is going to perform better than one that uses another company's chip and relies on Qualcomm's networking patents to even work at all.</p>
<p>You need only look at Samsung. Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback" target="_blank">makes its own chips</a> and sells many products that use them, but the phones it sells in North America almost all use a Qualcomm processor.</p><p>That's not a bad thing for you and me. Qualcomm processors are great. They're powerful, battery-efficient, and work well with our phone company. However, it gives Qualcomm a lot of leverage over any company that relies on sales in North America. Like Samsung.</p><p>After licensing fees, logistics, and supply-chain wizardry it's probably cheaper for Samsung to use Qualcomm chips than to use its own. That means it might not spend the time and R&D money it should to make Exynos chips better because Qualcomm chips can do everything it needs them to do.</p>

<p>Qualcomm chips can not do everything Google wants them to do. A Snapdragon chip is better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g3-leaked-details-rumors">Google's Tensor chip</a> at a lot of things, but when it comes to AI acceleration Qualcomm is playing catch up. Google was working on AI while Qualcomm was working on everything else, so this makes sense.</p><p>Google decided to pay those licensing fees and work around other issues to sell phones that are great at AI because it thinks AI is that important. Pixel phones are lacking when it comes to performance, battery life, and connectivity at the expense of AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision" target="_blank">Google is fine with that</a>.</p>
<p>If Xiaomi decides to build its own chips, it can take a page out of that playbook with the advantage that it doesn't have to build phones to please Verizon; it can build phones that please its own executives and, hopefully, its customers, using custom chips. Cell providers in China or Indonesia are different than one in Ontario or Texas and there shouldn't be a downgrade when it comes to network performance for the majority of Xiaomi's customers.</p><p>Using Qualcomm chips (or MediaTek chips for that matter) is fine and Xiaomi phones are awesome because of them. Xiaomi has a chance to make them even better.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series was spotted rolling through the FCC for its required certification.</li><li>Per the files, the S25 Ultra is confirmed to feature 45W wired fast charging, an S Pen, Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, and more connectivity support.</li><li>The S25 Plus is confirmed to stick close to the Ultra; however, the base S25 model might see a sharp drop in wireless charging strength to 9W.</li><li>Samsung is expected to launch the next series in January 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next flagship series is reportedly grabbing U.S. certification and confirming several key points.</p><p>The Korean OEM's Galaxy S25 series was spotted in the FCC certification database by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-fcc-certification/">91Mobiles</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-fcc-listing-3503726/">Android Authority</a>). Per the FCC's documents, the Galaxy S25 Ultra was confirmed as U.S. model number SM-938U. The device's files state it will continue to feature its S Pen. Additionally, the publication discovered the phone's charging capabilities.</p><p>According to the listing, the S25 Ultra's "travel adapter" features model number EP-T2510. More digging shows Samsung intends for the device to support 45W wired fast charging capabilities. We can breathe a sigh of relief as this means we won't see a change from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>Other specifications show the S25 Ultra will feature support for Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, 5G connectivity, GNSS, and NFC.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus with U.S. model number SM-936U will contain the same connectivity specifications as its Ultra sibling. Additionally, the listing confirms that it will also retain its 45W wired fast charging as its adapter's number matches the Ultra.</p><p>The base Galaxy S25 model (U.S. number SM-931U) snags the same connectivity specs, but its charging capabilities are where things differ from last year. The database states the phone will continue to support 25W wired fast charging, but its wireless function takes a hit. The S25 will reportedly support up to 9W wireless charging, down from the S24's 15W strength.</p>

<p>There are other specifications that haven't been confirmed, mostly those regarding its internal and physical aspects. However, the series is expected to rock Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Another expected aspect is for the Galaxy S25 series to take on a flatter design. The Galaxy S25 Ultra was tipped to ditch those sharp corners for softer, rounded corners to help with its handheld use. We've since seen a short <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaks-on-video">hands-on video</a> about the device leak, giving us a slight glimpse at its new form and flat sides. Joining that is a series of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/additional-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-7-images-leak">alleged live images</a> of the phone, which showcased its flatter design, thin bezels, and a bit of One UI 7.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">a South Korean report</a> claims Samsung's executive might bet big on the Galaxy S25 series topping its 2024 trio. The company was reportedly preparing to begin production of the new series to have roughly 2 million phones ready by December. Another 5 million are supposedly primed to come off the line in January. Samsung is also interested in funneling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">even more AI</a> into its next-gen devices.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut the Galaxy S25 series in January.</p>

There are still a lot of vehicles without that luxury, which is why there's been a steady stream of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories" target="_blank">adapters and dongles</a> to bridge the gap.</p><p>Carlinkit is one such brand that's been doing it for a while. Hence, the Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) is a successor to previous models, each one designed to be simpler and smoother than the last.</p><p>Plugging this in the first time means you should be up and running every time you turn on the ignition thereafter. Is that how it turns out? It only takes a few trips to find out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9b4gzxH9SFA2fFJdjgLRuL" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-unbox" alt="Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) unboxed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9b4gzxH9SFA2fFJdjgLRuL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Carlinkit 5.0's simplicity is obvious once you unbox it. It's just the adapter itself with two cables, one USB-C-to-USB-C and one USB-C-to-USB-A, ensuring you can connect to your car regardless of which USB port it has. You could be a little confused since the adapter also has both USB-C and USB-A ports, except the latter is meant for updating the device. More on that later.</p><p>Once you first bring it into your vehicle, you only need to plug it in after turning on the ignition. Built-in LEDs behind the Carlinkit logo on the unit indicate status, with pink showing up and flashing blue indicating the adapter has power. It then turns solid pink during the setup phase.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UMo9aZ99aovLyG4bnEcYB" name="Carlinkit-5.0-2air-setup" alt="Holding Carlinkit 5.0 adapter with logo flashing pink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UMo9aZ99aovLyG4bnEcYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The included manual has instructions for setting up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Apple CarPlay, though both generally follow the same type of sequence. The Carlinkit unit should appear in your phone's Bluetooth menu (as "AutoKit" or something similar). Select it to start the pairing process and it will work in the background to establish the connection.</p><p>It flashes blue as it works to do so but you'll only know that pairing was successful when you see Android Auto pop up on your infotainment screen. If you've set up Android Auto from your phone before — even if you used another dongle/adapter like this — you shouldn't have to go through the introductory setup. It literally picks up where you left off the last time you connected.</p><p>Subsequent connections usually see the platform appear on your vehicle screen in about 10 seconds, though I've found that isn't a hard and fast rule with this device. There were times when it took mere seconds to do it, and others where it seemed to struggle a few times before finally making it happen.</p>

<p>More often than not, Carlinkit 5.0 does its singular job well. You get in the car, start it up, and eventually carry on with whatever content you were listening to before you got in. If you've never experienced wireless Android Auto for yourself, the liberating feeling is immensely satisfying, even more so because you don't lose the platform's integration while also letting you wirelessly charge your phone if you're using a dock supporting the feature.</p><p>Whether streaming music, making phone calls, getting a route in Waze, or talking to Google Assistant, this adapter doesn't make any of those features feel difficult. Once it connects, it stays connected. On top of that, it remains steady in that it's not all that buggy, either.</p><p>The problem is when it doesn't necessarily connect properly, it becomes obvious. There may be false starts or intermittent cutouts, the latter of which I attribute to bad reception because it's happened to numerous wireless Android Auto dongles I've tested.</p>

<p>There are also some other caveats along the way that can prove challenging. If you share the vehicle with a spouse or partner, they may run into trouble trying to connect to the device, and Carlinkit's poor documentation and instructions don't really add a lot of confidence. That can happen whether they're using Android Auto or CarPlay.</p><p>Carlinkit 5.0 doesn't offer a seamless way to switch users the way certain others do, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/carsifi-review" target="_blank">Carsifi</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-auto-accessories" target="_blank">AAWireless</a>, for instance. It's not that you can't, but to do it, the one who first connects has to disconnect the Bluetooth connection and let the other connect in order to make it work. It's clunky and not exactly ideal.</p><p>You also have the benefit of firmware updates to keep the adapter current, albeit without a clearer path to install them. I'm nitpicking here, but I'm doing so because I can see where users who aren't as savvy with these types of devices might feel lost. There is no Carlinkit app on the Play Store, forcing you to run through a process of connecting to the device's Wi-Fi signal and typing in an IP address (noted in the manual) in your phone browser to find and install the update. It's worth doing because updates do come out, but it won't feel smooth.</p>

<p>The Carlinkit 5.0 (2air) has a regular price of $90 but you'll often find it selling for less online. At its discounted price, it's hard to argue with the role it plays, particularly if your needs and expectations are fairly basic. When you just want to cut the cord and go wireless running Android Auto, this gizmo can cover that well.</p><p>The rest of the experience is partly hindered by the confusing manual. Carlinkit would establish some trust with consumers if it suggested updating the firmware as one of the <em>first moves</em> to make upon setting it up. An app would then make the update process far smoother than it currently is. Put those things in place, and there's very little to find fault with on this thing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Information is supposedly coming to light about the next OnePlus midrange device to shore up the 13 series flagship.</p><p>A leaked photo from Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P2fhMEao5">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) suggests a few changes for the OnePlus 13R (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/one-plus-13-r-early-leaks-flat-sides/">Android Police</a>). The tipster claims that the midrange phone will feature a "ceramic body." This would be a first for OnePlus' toned-down smartphone, as DCS adds this type of material was previously given to a flagship device with "higher craftsmanship."</p><p>DCS states the phone will follow its higher OnePlus 13 sibling by incorporating a completely flat screen and sides. Moreover, the post claims its display will be protected by a "crystal glass shield." The publication speculates this could indicate some sort of ceramic shielding, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>The rendering also purports the OnePlus 13R will keep its circular camera array. Moreover, it seems to have ditched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">old shiny, metallic piece</a> that flowed into the side of the phone.</p><p>Additionally, DCS claims the next midrange phone will rock Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC.</p>

<p>The tipster claims the chip will provide "power consumption close to the performance of the 8 Elite." The publication cites the OnePlus president, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/P2dhZmzRq">who confirmed this SD 8 Gen 3 rumor</a> shortly before. Louis Lee shared some insight about the OnePlus 13R, saying it can reach an average frame rate of 120Hz. Lee then touts the device's enhancements in temperature management.</p><p>In another post, OnePlus confirmed that the 13R will debut "soon," though a specific date wasn't given.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13r-specs-leak-3491078/">previous DCS rumor</a> spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13r-leaked-renders-3503567/">Android Authority</a> claims the phone will feature a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP telephoto lens, and a ~6,000mAh battery.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">very early leaked rendering</a> of the OnePlus 13R alleged that the device could see a dramatic change in its camera array. That photo showed a square array, but what we've seen today keeps things in line with previous R series phones.</p><p>With the OnePlus president claiming a launch would arrive "soon," it gets us thinking about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">previous schedule rumor</a>. A tipster suggested that OnePlus was preparing to launch its Watch 3 shortly in global markets. The rumor was accompanied by the OnePlus 13R and the flagship 13 device. Current speculation states the 13R could see a debut in China in December, meaning it could roll out globally a month or two after.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago, I'd never used any Android smartwatch. Now look at my pile of Wear OS review units above; I've spent weeks or months with each of the most popular Android watches, and fancy myself a Wear OS expert. With Black Friday deals in full swing, I'm here to point you toward the watch you actually need, not just the best price or impulse buy.</p><p>It's my job this week to highlight Black Friday smartwatch deals, but they're <em>all</em> on sale. The old Wear OS 3.5 watches like the TicWatch E3 ($79) or Pro 3 ($119) are the cheapest; the last-gen Pixel Watch 2 ($145) and Galaxy Watch 6 ($139) fall in the middle; and the latest Galaxy, Pixel, and OnePlus watches are all about $200–300, depending on which size you choose.</p><p>This Android smartwatch Black Friday guide will run through the hardware, software, health, and fitness differences across each major brand, to help you choose the best fit! And within each brand, I'll help you decide if, for instance, you can get away with a last-gen Pixel Watch, or if you'd prefer the Watch 6 Classic or Ultra.</p>

But this guide will focus more on Wear OS watches that integrate <strong>directly</strong> with Android phones and apps.</p><p>Wear OS 3 or 3.5 watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-wellness-edition-review">Fossil Gen 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-3-gps-review">TicWatch Pro 3</a> are very cheap right now and still receive the occasional security update, but their older hardware can't accommodate the newer software. I'll walk you through whether Wear OS 4, 5, and future versions are worth paying extra for.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a> added the ability to backup and restore your smartwatch, as well as transfer it to a new phone without having to factory reset it and lose all your apps and settings. It also made some power optimizations such as enabling XML watch faces, to help your watch last longer.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is where Google and Samsung really went all out. The software became much more efficient by pushing more actions to the low-powered coprocessor. Content now reflows to take advantage of larger screens, while watch faces added some key metrics like weather forecasts and goal progress; Google added new tools like Recorder, Google Home controls, and a camera viewfinder, while fitness apps could now support more in-depth and responsive workouts. Samsung watches also added AI-enabled Energy scores and suggested replies, plus new gestures and sleep apnea detection.</p><p>We don't know yet what Wear OS 6 will bring to the table, but the current focus seems to be on battery efficiency, new fitness tricks, Google app integrations, and more AI capabilities. If you can get a smartwatch with Wear OS 5, or due to receive Wear OS 6+, then you'll know it's built to last.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-classic-pros-and-cons-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch (7, Ultra, Classic): Pros and cons</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D3XUws3Evcq8v9DY9ejQFe" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-Ultra-1.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (left, silver) and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (right, black) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3XUws3Evcq8v9DY9ejQFe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung watches have the highest sales among Android smartwatches, most likely because it's the top-selling Android phone brand and people like the interplay between Galaxy devices. However, Samsung's size and global reach have allowed it to sell a greater <em>variety</em> of watch designs, launching Ultra, Classic, Pro, and FE models in the last three years.</p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watches' strengths: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Exynos hardware is optimized for speedy performance</li><li>Classic, Ultra both offer unique looks for Android watches</li><li>Most Wear OS updates (4 years) and speediest behind Google</li><li>Samsung Health AI insights are useful and currently free (though maybe not in 2026+)</li><li>Latest models have <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test">accurate HR and GPS tracking</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watches' weaknesses</strong></p>
<ul><li>Mainline watch design isn't that attractive; lack of crown is polarizing</li><li>Need to pay top dollar for consistent multi-day battery life (Ultra)</li><li>Galaxy Watch FE is just a reskinned Watch 4 with old tech</li><li>Some features require Galaxy phone (AFib detection, sleep apnea)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Current deals:</strong> As of publication, the Watch FE ($126), Watch 6 ($139), Watch 7 ($202), Watch 6 Classic ($239), and Watch Ultra ($434) all have significant Black Friday discounts. They're cheapest on Amazon, but if you buy from Samsung, you can trade in any watch for $100 extra off, or most Galaxy Watches for $200–300 off, making most of them close to free.</p><p><strong>My recommendation: </strong>The Galaxy Watch 7, Watch Ultra, and Watch 6 are <em>all</em> on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watch</a> guide, and we've given each glowing reviews with a few caveats. Any of these are worth buying, especially if you have a Galaxy phone.</p><p>Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Watch 7 vs. Watch 6</a>, they aren't all that different aside from the newer Exynos chip, extra storage, and improved GPS and HR data. <em>I</em> would benefit from the Watch 7 because I'm a runner, but the Watch 6 is more than good enough for casual athletes, especially at that price and with three years of updates remaining. That's my first recommendation.</p><p>You can also pay a little extra for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, but only if you're really invested in its style and the physical rotating bezel. Since Samsung abandoned the Watch 5 Pro, it could easily do the same for the 6 Classic now that it has the expensive Ultra; that means now's your chance to get one.</p><p>I love my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for its doubled battery life, 3,000-nit display, and <em>cooler</em> design than other Galaxy Watches. But even at a deal price, it's expensive; you can cut the price down to $189 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch-ultra/buy/galaxy-watch-ultra-47mm-titanium-gray-sm-l705udaaxaa/">right trade-in</a>, but at the full $434, it's harder to recommend when you can get another Galaxy Watch for less than half that.</p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-3-and-2-pros-and-cons-2">Google Pixel Watch (3 and 2): Pros and cons</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-nest-cam-live-feed.jpeg" alt="Nest Doorbell live feed on the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SJjsSKMQGc6UuycG4WeaB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pixel Watches regularly add new tricks, like this Nest Doorbell feed </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the original Pixel Watch was a long-delayed, fun but flawed smartwatch, the Pixel Watch 2 and Watch 3 fixed its flaws by adding a properly fast Snapdragon chip (PW2), an array of Fitbit sensors (PW2), and a bright, thin-bordered display in two sizes (PW3). Without these deal-breakers, the Pixel Watch has become a great Pixel phone companion.</p><p><strong>Google Pixel Watches' strengths:</strong></p>
<ul><li>First to receive a lot of Google-specific apps and tricks, with three OS updates</li><li>Probably the most non-traditional and eye-catching Android watch design</li><li>Fitbit health data is often spot-on, and its fitness software keeps improving</li><li>All-around strong performance and improved battery life with Wear OS 5</li></ul>
<p><strong>Google Pixel Watches' weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Rounded display is fairly vulnerable to damage, lacks sapphire glass</li><li>Tends to be the most expensive and least frequently discounted, with the only Wear OS health subscription</li><li>No alternate or "Ultra" versions with enhanced battery for power users</li></ul>
<p><strong>Current deals:</strong> The Pixel Watch 3 45mm ($329) is only $70 off, but the LTE version ($329) is $170 off, meaning you might as well get the free cellular perk. The Pixel Watch 3 41mm ($279) is a little more affordable, while the Pixel Watch 2 ($145) has a strong discount.</p><p><strong>My recommendations:</strong> Several Android Central staffers use the Pixel Watch 3 as their daily smartwatch despite having other free options on hand; that's why I titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review" target="_blank">my Watch 3 review</a> "Our favorite smartwatch." They prefer Google's colorful UI and stock Wear OS software to Samsung's One UI Watch — not to mention the Pixel Watch's more attractive look and crown controls.</p><p>That being said, the Pixel Watch 3 and 2 aren't for everyone. They have exclusive integrations with Pixel phone apps and tools, which may be a deal-breaker or draw for you. Fitbit caters to athletes, but the lack of metal around the display doesn't lend itself to rugged sports conditions. And other Wear OS watches last days longer.</p><p>If you're weighing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 3 vs. Watch 2</a>, it really comes down to whether or not you want to jump from a thick-bordered 1.2-inch display to a brighter, smoother 1.28- or 1.43-inch display. The newer watch has other upgrades like faster charging and UWB that the linked guide runs through; the visual downgrade is what matters most, but it'll save you about $130. Not a bad trade!</p>

<h2 id="oneplus-watch-2-2r-pros-cons-2">OnePlus Watch (2 & 2R): Pros & cons</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd" name="oneplus-watch-2-27.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 Play Store icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus' first Wear OS watch, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">collaborative effort</a> with Google, using Wear OS for the main Snapdragon chip but a coprocessor running its proprietary RTOS for background tasks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> has the same internals, only a plainer and less rugged design for a lower price. Both have OnePlus' trademark fast-charging tech and strong performance, but also some flaws that more polished Wear OS watches lack.</p><p><strong>OnePlus watches' strengths:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The battery life will blow you away</li><li>Military-grade durability and classic style (Watch 2 only)</li><li>Surprisingly <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test">decent fitness accuracy</a> with dual-band GPS</li><li>Very affordably priced</li><li>Two promised Wear OS updates</li></ul>
<p><strong>OnePlus watches' weaknesses</strong></p>
<ul><li>No smaller display option or working crown</li><li>No guarantee on how quickly Wear OS updates will arrive</li><li>OHealth is bare compared to Samsung Health or Fitbit</li><li>No LTE option outside of China</li></ul>
<p><strong>Current deals:</strong> The OnePlus Watch 2 ($199) has a greater discount than the Watch 2R ($169), and it's also the only watch currently available on Amazon. The Watch 2R ships directly from OnePlus and comes with a free fluoroelastomer band in the box.</p><p><strong>My recommendation:</strong> The main reason to buy the Watch 2 is for its 3–4-day battery life, matching or beating the Galaxy Watch Ultra but for less than half the price. In exchange, you miss out on Samsung or Google perks like ECGs, skin temperature readings, standalone cellular, crown or bezel controls beyond screen swipes, and so on.</p><p>I also don't think I'd like using OHealth as my regular fitness guide; if you choose the Watch 2, I'd recommend relying on a third-party Wear OS option like Strava instead.</p><p>According to a leaker, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">OnePlus Watch 3</a> arrives in January alongside the OnePlus 13. If that's true, then you may want to wait on buying the Watch 2. This new launch could herald the missing Wear OS 5 update for the older watches; if the Watch 3 <em>also</em> launches with Wear OS 4, that'll reveal something about whether or not OnePlus can keep up with Google and Samsung on software.</p>

<h2 id="mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-3-5-enduro-atlas-pros-and-cons-2">Mobvoi TicWatch (E3, 3, 5, Enduro, Atlas): Pros and cons</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZkgNZmXc4J9KGoiZMUUGcc" name="ticwatch-pro-5-and-pro-5-enduro-top-down.jpg" alt="TicWatch Pro 5 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro top-down view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZkgNZmXc4J9KGoiZMUUGcc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The TicWatch Pro 5 and Pro 5 Enduro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TicWatch is the one Wear OS brand left standing that doesn't have its own ecosystem of devices and focuses solely on smartwatches. It releases new watches every year like clockwork, and we've almost always given them positive reviews. But ever since Wear OS 3, Mobvoi has fallen about a year behind other brands on updates while losing access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>.</p><p><strong>Mobvoi TicWatch strengths:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Enduro and Atlas have durability, battery life of GW Ultra for much less</li><li>Unique dual-panel display can stretch battery over a month</li><li>Performance is reliably fast, with access to Play Store suite</li></ul>
<p><strong>Mobvoi TicWatch weaknesses:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Will probably remain a year behind Google and Samsung for updates, with no sign of Google Assistant</li><li>Current watches have no guaranteed <em>number</em> of updates</li><li>Most models come in one large, heavy size</li></ul>
<p><strong>Current deals:</strong> The TicWatch E3 ($79), Pro 3 GPS ($79), and Pro 3 Ultra ($119) are all about as cheap as a Wear OS watch is likely to be. For newer models with updated software, the TicWatch Pro 5 ($209) and Pro 5 Enduro ($244) are both over $100 off, while the newest Atlas ($279) is affordable if you compare it to the Galaxy Watch Ultra or Pixel Watch 3 45mm.</p><p><strong>My recommendation: </strong>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/blog/Wear-OS-4-Upgrade-and-Enhanced-Functionality-for-TicWatch-Pro-5-Series">Mobvoi Wear OS 4 update</a> has a wide array of optimizations and fitness features. Older smartwatches like the TicWatch E3 and Pro 3 won't receive it, so read that list and decide if you can live without these perks before you buy a last-gen model. Personally, I wouldn't buy the older models, but that's because I'm willing to spend a little more on a smartwatch.</p><p>As for the latest models, we only rated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">5 Enduro</a> because the software update issue wasn't fully clear in 2023, and we expected the watches to get Google Assistant like Fossil watches did. By and large, you're buying TicWatches for the same reason as OnePlus watches: for the affordable battery life and rugged designs, and if you're less concerned about cutting-edge smart features.</p><p>Look at it this way: do you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/using-google-keep-and-recorder-app-on-pixel-watch">actually use smartwatch apps</a>, or do you only use smartwatches to check notifications and work out? If the latter, then perhaps you don't need a Pixel or Galaxy watch with years of features to come, and you'll be happy with an affordable TicWatch instead.</p>

<hr>
<p>We technically didn't cover <em>every</em> Wear OS smartwatch, but I don't recommend buying the Fossil Gen 6 — also on sale for Black Friday — because Fossil doesn't support Wear OS anymore, aside from the occasional security update. And if you find any other Wear OS watch in stock like the Citizen CZ Smart, the same principle applies (skip it).</p><p>The Xiaomi Watch 2 and 2 Pro aren't sold in the United States, and we've yet to review them; if they happen to be on sale in your region, then most of my OnePlus pros and cons will probably apply. On paper, they're very similar watches.</p><p>Otherwise, whatever Android smartwatch you're looking for, it's probably on sale right now! So hopefully this guide will help you focus on what you need (or don't need) from your next cheap smartwatch.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 series may be dominating the headlines, but don't let that distract you from this fabulous deal that carves $400 off the Google Pixel 8 Pro during Best Buy's Black Friday sale. </p>
<p>The Pixel 8 Pro's standing has dropped from megastar to underdog, but it still rivals the best flagships of 2024, thanks to its useful AI software features, seven years of OS updates, and one of the best designs on any Pixel phone to date. There's a reason why we called it "the flagship phone to beat in 2023". </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the best phones that Google has ever produced at a midrange price point; you appreciate large, vibrant displays, AI features, and lots of software support.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can afford the Google Pixel 9 Pro; you can get a better deal through your carrier; you&apos;re a stickler about using the latest devices. </p><p><strong>One could argue that grabbing the Google Pixel 8 Pro at this price is a better move than picking up the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review"><strong>Pixel 9</strong></a><strong> during Black Friday.</strong></p><p>Indeed, the last-gen model has a larger 6.7-inch display, more advanced camera tech, a bigger battery, and potentially better performance due to the Tensor G3 chipset (although gaming might still be an issue).
