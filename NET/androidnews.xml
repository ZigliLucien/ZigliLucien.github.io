<ul><li>Evidence shows that Google has continued to progress in the development of e-passports in the Wallet app.</li><li>The company explains that an ID pass created from your passport can be used at "select" airline checkpoints, but it is not to be seen as the replacement for the physical version.</li><li>Digital passports in Wallet will arrive as U.S. exclusives and can work through NFC and QR codes for domestic flights.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing to bring digital convenience to our passports, however, it might be wise to carry its physical form still.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1808827267893612649">AssembleDebug </a>recently posted a screenshot of the upcoming feature through Google Wallet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-support-digital-passport/">Android Police</a>). The tagline for the function reads, "create an ID pass with your passport." The feature seems closer to release now, with the photo stating that e-passports will be restricted to U.S. users. </p><p>The tipster then referenced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-e-passport-support-3444362/">a previous post</a>, highlighting some of the functionality users can expect.</p><p>As spotted in a previous beta, the company stated that an ID pass created for a passport would let users verify their "identity for domestic flights at select airline security checkpoints or online purchases."</p><p>More digging showed that users could tap their phone&apos;s reader (NFC), or the authorities could scan the passport&apos;s generated QR code. Moreover, Google will have some safety rails in place, such as personal authentication before sharing information.</p><p>The beta showed that users will have a chance to "review" any information that&apos;s been requested of them. Also, another layer of security will prompt users to verify their identity by entering a previously set fingerprint, PIN, or password.</p><p>While Google Wallet is preparing to incorporate digital passports, it would be a time saver, but it&apos;s not all sunshine. Even now, the company is still urging users to carry their physical passports with them as this digital variant isn&apos;t a replacement. This is likely due to the "select TSA checkpoint" caveat.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is a screenshot for the upcoming passport support in the Google Wallet. This is going to be a US only feature. https://t.co/lhXdqLeAcp pic.twitter.com/PiEgjOkfAh<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1808827267893612649">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With Google Wallet&apos;s development continuing, it seems likely that e-passport support in the U.S. will roll out sooner rather than later.</p><p>In other news, the company rolled out a feature that lets users double their Android phone as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/your-android-phone-can-now-double-as-a-hotel-room-key-thanks-to-google-wallet">a hotel room key</a>. Participating hotels will let users add their room key to their Wallet via their app or website. The good thing here is that the addition of digital room keys means there&apos;s less chance you misplace them.</p><p>Moreover, the digital version piggybacks off your phone&apos;s NFC for an easy "tap to open" experience. Support for this feature is set to arrive first for The Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

Grab the wonderfully-balanced Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-marble-gray/6570273.p"><strong>you&apos;ll score a $200 discount</strong></a> when you activate today. Purchase the phone unlocked instead and you&apos;ll still enjoy $100 off, which is a stellar deal in its own right. </p><p>No trade-in is required to take part in the offer, although if you <em>do</em> have an old device to send to Best Buy, up to $600 of trade-in credit is currently available.</p>

<p>Pick up the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</a> from Best Buy this weekend and you'll score $200 off the phone when you activate today. If you prefer to buy your smartphones unlocked, skip the activation for now and you'll get a $100 discount, which is pretty darn good for a flagship device that's only been out for about six months. </p>
<p>The middle-child in Samsung's S24 series, the Galaxy S24 Plus boasts all-day battery life, the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a compact, nearly bezel-less design that reminds us of recent iPhones. You also get seven years of OS support guaranteed and all of Samsung's latest AI-powered software features. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-marble-gray/6570273.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ced49287-33ce-4c68-94f2-408505d8ca2c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w"><strong>Galaxy Reserve: $50 OFF Samsung's new phones before they're announced</strong></a></li></ul>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like to buy your smartphones through retailers like Best Buy; you don&apos;t want to wait until Prime Day to purchase your new phone; you want the physical feel of an iPhone with the OS of an Android; battery life is important to you. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">best Prime Day phone deals</a> to go live; you have an old device to trade in and belong to a mainstream wireless carrier like Verizon or AT&T. </p><p>Indeed, Amazon&apos;s Prime Day 2024 is set to kick off on July 16th, and the Samsung Galaxy S24 series is almost certain to receive some major discounts during the 48-hour sale. In other words, if you can wait a few more weeks to buy your phone, it may be worth it. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-can-score-dollar50-off-samsungs-newest-galaxy-devices-before-theyre-even-announced-heres-the-deal">Galaxy Unpacked</a> is July 10th and we expect that Samsung will reveal its latest lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> at the announcement event, so if you have the extra cash and you&apos;re interested in those innovative devices, we&apos;d recommend waiting for that too. </p><p>But with that being said, if you simply want a great phone at a great price <em>today</em>, this deal from Best Buy presents an awesome opportunity. </p>

<p>The year is already more than halfway over, and with that, we&apos;re nearing the launch of Samsung&apos;s latest foldable phones. Here in the States, Samsung continues to reign supreme with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip lineup, even with Motorola and OnePlus providing some pretty tempting alternatives. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has been on the market for nearly a year, offering welcome improvements over its predecessors. Yet, as plenty more foldables reach consumers, the Z Fold 5 remains one of our favorites.</p><p>As we near the presumed launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, we thought it would be a good time to reflect on how the past year with the Fold 5 has gone.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-design-and-displays-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Design and displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-hinge-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p><em><strong>"From a surface level, the Fold 5 looks identical to the Fold 4. That quickly changes the moment you hold its thinner, lighter chassis though. It&apos;s clear this form factor is the best design on the market at the moment, even with the weird aspect ratio."</strong></em></p><p>There are a lot of reasons for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> being as divisive as it is. Arguably, the biggest reason is the overall design, with the cover screen being about as long and barely wider than a King Size Snickers bar. The screen itself is about as good as it gets, with its 120Hz variable refresh and peak brightness of 1,750 nits.</p><p>However, it&apos;s quite a bit more narrow than practically any other smartphone out there, let alone the best foldable phones. It&apos;s something that I&apos;ve flip-flopped between, seeing as it&apos;s perfect for one-handed usage or doom-scrolling social media.</p><p>It&apos;s even <em>fine</em> for responding to messages or emails in a pinch. However, the moment that you want to try and do <em>anything</em> else, you&apos;ll either think twice or need to unfold it to reveal the inner screen. It&apos;s a stark contrast to the way of thinking when using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and its Cover Screen that is more like a phone on its own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="v4pUVoVtSGfAnwgioj8ceD" name="standby-mode-pro-picture-frame-galaxy-z-fold-5.jpg" alt="Picture frame in StandBy Mode Pro on Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4pUVoVtSGfAnwgioj8ceD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After swapping between the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the OnePlus Open for the past nine months, I think I&apos;ve settled on wanting something in the middle. A Cover Screen that&apos;s still great for one-handed usage but is wide enough to do anything besides the most basic of tasks.</p><p>As for the inner screen, my biggest complaint remains the fact that Samsung&apos;s display is looking a bit outdated. It&apos;s not as bad as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, but after using the OnePlus Open, it&apos;s clear that Samsung has some work to do. Not to mention the improvements that Vivo and others have been making to reduce the crease.</p><p>It&apos;s one thing when you&apos;re using the inner screen just to browse the web, watch a movie, or read a book. However, I&apos;ve actually stopped reaching for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/slim-s-pen-case-for-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">S Pen</a> as much simply because I feel as though I have to use it on one half of the screen or the other. Trying to split the uprights results in just hopping over it all together to avoid even touching the crease.</p>
<p><em><strong>"This display is simultaneously more vision-friendly thanks to the addition of more accessibility options, but folks sensitive to flickering lights or displays will have an even harder time using this due to the slow flicker rate and high brightness."</strong></em></p>

<p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM issues</a> don&apos;t affect me when it comes to using different types of displays, that&apos;s not the case for everyone. My colleague Nick Sutrich has done an absolutely phenomenal job at shedding light on this problem.</p><p>So, while Samsung might be able to tout that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has one of the best displays, some of its potential customers can&apos;t even look at them. Unfortunately, this is the category that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pwm-flickering-displays-bothering-our-readers">Nick falls into</a>, as using certain screens for just minutes results in him feeling nauseous, leaving him with a splitting headache, or both.</p><p>The reason why I call this out is that despite his own attempts to find answers, he&apos;s largely been left "on read." It wasn&apos;t until recently that phone makers even started mentioning PWM rates. However, Samsung is not one of them, and from where I stand, it sure seems like these companies don&apos;t care. Instead, it feels as though companies are okay with losing a sliver of their potential customer base as opposed to actually solving the problem.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jPB3b9G8hSure3eoBaYqNJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-gamesir-x2-minecraft-02.jpg" alt="Playing Minecraft on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 using a GameSir X2 controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPB3b9G8hSure3eoBaYqNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"Samsung absolutely nailed both battery life and performance with this phone. It easily lasts into the second day on a single charge and the performance never falters, even when playing graphically-intense games for long periods of time. Plus, it doesn&apos;t even get hot."</strong></em></p><p>What more can you really ask for when it comes to a device that&apos;s as fast and as powerful as pretty much anything else? Although the software section comes next, it&apos;s not like we&apos;re stuck in the TouchWiz days when every update would result in tremendous slowdowns.</p><p>To me, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is as fast and fluid today as it was when it first arrived in my mailbox. It&apos;s more than capable when it comes to mobile gaming, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo Switch</a> and PS2 emulation. And when paired with a controller like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/razer-kishi-ultra-launch">Razer Kishi Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the "Super Switch" we&apos;ve been hoping for.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="k7SEZeXCXPuacfncTqQGgB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-cover-screen-in-tree.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Cover Screen in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7SEZeXCXPuacfncTqQGgB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>On the flip side, I can&apos;t say the same about the battery. Although my day-to-day life is much different compared to when the Galaxy Z Fold 5 was released, it&apos;s almost impossible to make it through an entire day. For reference, my day begins between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., and I&apos;m usually not in bed until around 1 a.m.</p><p>That&apos;s a long day, for sure, and it&apos;s probably asking too much for a phone to be able to keep up with my needs. But I find myself needing to make decisions about <em>what</em> I want to do on my phone. Other times, I&apos;ll go to turn on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-light-bulb">smart lights</a> in my bedroom only to find that it&apos;s just given up the goose for the day.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Software</h2>

<p><em><strong>"No company makes better foldable phone software than Samsung. Even with the handful of small improvements this year, Samsung is miles ahead of the competition."</strong></em></p><p>I can&apos;t help but feel that Nick&apos;s sentiments couldn&apos;t be summed up any better. Even after spending a lot of time with the OnePlus Open, there&apos;s just something that "clicks" with the Fold 5. The multitasking interface works more in line with how my brain works.</p><p>While Google continues to work on its own desktop-like interface, I have little doubt that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX </a>will remain supreme for a while. Really, the only thing that could change that is Samsung itself, as it&apos;s already been tinkering with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">DeX on tablets</a>. I&apos;m just hoping to see DeX left alone, giving people the option to use it as an all-in-one computing device.</p><p>My only real gripe in this department is rather mundane. I just wish Samsung would bake the "Theme Park" plugin from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> into OneUI. Then, make it so icon packs automatically update whenever a new app is installed. All in an effort to get rid of the "squircle" icon that seems to be the inspiration for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU" name="Galaxy-ai-is-here.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2Kcau6uMkxdqAt6SSqgVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This brings me to the subject of software and feature updates for Samsung&apos;s flagship foldable. Google and Samsung are pretty much neck-and-neck when it comes to releasing regular updates for their devices, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 has been no different.</p><p>The bigger question came following the Galaxy S24 Ultra launch, complete with Samsung&apos;s new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>" feature set. Not every feature from the Ultra has come to the Fold 5, simply due to the lack of the NPU paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>However, One UI 6.1 brought a bunch of new features, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, Instant Slow-Mo, Note Assist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Google&apos;s Circle to Search</a>, and more. All of these features are cloud-based, ensuring that Fold 5 owners don&apos;t miss out on too much. So while a few features are still limited to the Galaxy S24, that likely won&apos;t be the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. At least, we hope. </p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WqcczAXyQhrxxxbY5dSbH9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-camera-viewfinder-01.jpg" alt="Taking a photo with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5's telephoto camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WqcczAXyQhrxxxbY5dSbH9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"The Galaxy Z Fold 5&apos;s camera has been marginally improved over the Z Fold 4&apos;s, but the improvements just don&apos;t feel like enough for an $1,800 phone in 2023. Thankfully, video recording quality is excellent and overall photo quality still feels good enough in most cases."</strong></em></p><p>There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with the cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 5. They produce solid images, provided that the conditions are right or you&apos;re okay with using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-shoot-and-edit-raw-photos-your-android-phone">Expert RAW</a> app. Many of the same features found in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are also found here. And following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, even more features are trickling down.</p><p>Both the inner and outer selfie cameras are <em>fine</em>, and get the job done, as long as you only want to snap a quick selfie. You can pretty much say the same thing about the rear camera setup.</p><p>But if you&apos;re even halfway serious about photography, why would you spend more money to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 5 over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>? The former <em>starts</em> at $1,799 and only includes 256GB of storage. Meanwhile, if you max out the latter, you&apos;ll enjoy 1TB of storage, save yourself $140, AND have arguably the best cameras in a smartphone (at least here in the States.)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ANQEisVLvjhTUh3jRGUWU6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-camera-viewfinder-flex-mode.jpg" alt="The camera viewfinder on the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANQEisVLvjhTUh3jRGUWU6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only conclusion that I can come to for getting the Galaxy Z Fold 5 is being able to use it without a tripod. As long as you have a level surface, the Fold 5 doubles as its own tripod.</p><p>On a recent family trip, we wanted to take a group picture before we left the rental property. I tried using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, but as soon as I thought it was steady and level, the phone started to fall. Despite having an inferior camera, I grabbed my Fold 5, propped it open, set a timer, and jumped into the frame. It didn&apos;t fall, and I could easily get everything set up thanks to the split-pane interface in the Camera app.</p><p>It wasn&apos;t a picture that was going to win any awards, but it offered a level of convenience that you just can&apos;t find on slab phones. The bigger problem arises in those times when you want a crisp and detailed photo, only to find that part of the picture gets blown out on the Fold 5 when that wouldn&apos;t be the case on the iPhone or Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-is-it-still-worth-buying-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: Is it still worth buying?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HbrWKsJ9CzXy7nUPdvDKsG" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-on-patio.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 folded on patio ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbrWKsJ9CzXy7nUPdvDKsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors and leaks for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 seemingly reveal that Samsung is kind of giving up on foldables. The only two expected changes come in the form of a spec bump and a slight redesign. It appears as though everything else will remain the same.</p><p>Making the decision more difficult is that outside of carrier and trade-in deals, Samsung is still selling the unlocked Galaxy Z Fold 5 for its full retail price. Suffice it to say that if you spent the money today on Fold 5 without knowing that Fold 6 is around the corner, you&apos;d probably be a little unhappy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-with-fold-4-youtube-music.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 running YouTube Music next to a Greygreen Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If it were my money, I&apos;d wait for Samsung to officially announce the Galaxy Z Fold 6 before making a decision. Not only will we have concrete information, but Samsung also has a tendency to offer some mind-boggling trade-in promotions when new flagship phones are announced.</p><p>I also wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there wasn&apos;t a bit of a "delay" between the announcement and when the Fold 6 arrives in stores. That should give you enough time to make a decision. While ultimately, it&apos;s your money and your decision, I&apos;d probably still avoid buying the Galaxy Z Fold 5 in favor of the Fold 6.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Amazon is shifting from full-screen startup ads to static ads before the screensaver on Fire TV.</li><li>These new ads last 30 seconds to a minute and are part of the "Ambient Experience" feature.</li><li>Currently, this seems to be targeting US users with Fire TV models from 2016 onwards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After easing up on Fire TV full-screen video ads that played when the device starts up, Amazon is now pushing a new ad method using your screensaver.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/amazon-adds-full-screen-ads-on-the-fire-tv-replacing-your-screensaver/" target="_blank">Cord Cutter News</a> reports that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fire-tv-edition-televisions">Fire TV devices</a> now show static ads before the screensaver starts. These ads apparently run for 30 seconds to a minute, as per the report.</p><p>Amazon has since confirmed to the outlet that it is rolling out this type of advert as part of the "Ambient Experience" feature. At the moment, it appears to be targeting US users with promotional messages on Fire TV models made from 2016 onwards.</p><p>However, it&apos;s still uncertain how widespread this rollout is. Cord Cutter News is a reliable source, but the lack of widespread user reports hints that the pre-screensaver ad might only be available to a limited audience for now.</p><p>Amazon has been ramping up its advertising on the Fire TV platform. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">adding in-stream ads on Prime Video for non-premium users</a> and briefly using full-screen startup video ads, which were later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-eases-up-on-annoying-fire-tv-video-ads">toned down and made optional</a>.</p><p>The new pre-screensaver ads fit into this overall strategy. Here&apos;s hoping that Amazon will also provide a way to turn off these ads, although they likely expect many users to keep seeing them.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s move to add pre-screensaver ads on Fire TV is part of a wider industry trend, with competitors like Roku doing similar things to find new revenue streams.</p><p>However, the user experience must stay a top priority. There should be an easy way to turn off these ads since they can be pretty annoying when you&apos;re just trying to watch TV.</p><p>While ads in free or ad-supported content are nothing new, adding ads to streaming devices like Fire TV after people have bought them can be a bit annoying. Users who have already paid for the device might feel like their experience is being compromised by these new ads.</p>

<p>Firstly, the images shared by the Reddit user seem to be the real deal. They showcase the buds in a Metallic grey finish aided by a charging case with a similar finish and translucent design at the top.</p><p>While they still appear identical to Apple AirPods Pro 2, Samsung seems to have differentiated them with little changes like the dual-tone finish, blue and orange indicators for the left and right earbuds, and even the charging case complementing them.</p><p>Users who seem to have had their hands on the Buds 3 Pro managed to connect it to the Galaxy Z Flip 4, and the connection seemed to have been smooth with the iPhone as well.</p><p>Until now, we have only seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-buds-3-stem-design-leak">marketing images</a> and the Buds 3 Pro&apos;s design being spotted via Samsung apps. Regardless, these new images turned out to be quite substantial right before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Unpacked Event</a>, scheduled for July 10 in Paris.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.90%;"><img id="9qpA95CCfm6pFeD5QhgEej" name="Galaxy-Buds-3-retail-packaging.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 retail packaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qpA95CCfm6pFeD5QhgEej.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1156" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: via GSMArena)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, as mentioned, the Galaxy Buds 3 retail packaging confirms the new stem design, which is not limited to the Pro model. The new stem element is a significant change in terms of design for both buds. </p><p>It should also mean we might likely be getting better controls and microphone quality, and new long-pressing actions are expected to control the music playback, activate noise cancellation, and much more.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp could be testing a new feature that allows users to create AI-generated images of themselves.</li><li>The "imagine me" feature requires users to upload one set-up picture that closely resembles them in real life onto Meta AI's chatbot, followed by a text prompt that helps the tool generate a new image of the user.</li><li>This feature is optional; users must head to the app's settings to enable/disable it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp Messenger could be exploring a new feature that allows users to create AI-generated images of themselves, powered by Meta AI. According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-14-13-whats-new/"> WABetaInfo, </a>the app&apos;s Android 2.24.14.13 update, which is available on the Google Play Store, shows that WhatsApp is working on this fun feature.</p><p>This feature requires users to upload one set-up picture that closely resembles them in real life onto Meta AI&apos;s chatbot. Then, the user can type in a prompt that matches what they want to see in their image, for instance, imagining themselves in a different setting or background. The tool will then create an AI-powered  image specific to the prompt when the user hits on "imagine me." </p><p>As seen in the leaked screenshot, the app says users can take photos of themselves once and imagine themselves in any setting, "from the forest to outer space."</p><p>This sounds a lot like a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/another-ai-packed-feature-could-be-on-the-way-for-youtube-shorts">YouTube is testing </a>called the "Dream Screen," which uses text-based prompts to generate AI images/videos that can be used as green screen backgrounds for Shorts. It lets people "bring their imagination to life."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s9Wdv2ewUiV8aKKBCLYmKG" name="Whatsapp-imagine-me.jpg" alt="whatsapp feature update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9Wdv2ewUiV8aKKBCLYmKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication states that the user will also be allowed to pull up this feature in any other chat by typing in the command "@Meta AI imagine me," followed by the prompt. The AI image will be processed separately, and the app will automatically share the image message in the conversation, keeping chats with users end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that this feature remains optional, and users must &apos;opt-in&apos; to access it. This means users who wish to use this feature need to head to the app&apos;s settings to enable it. Keeping privacy in mind, WhatsApp is said to give users full control over the images they share as "set up" photos, as they can delete them at any time through Meta&apos;s AI settings.</p><p>While this feature is still being tested, it remains unclear which future update will bring this feature to users at large and whether other users can upload pictures that aren&apos;t of themselves. Android Central has contacted Whatsapp on this, but they didn&apos;t get back to us in time for publication. We will update this article when we have more information.</p><p>WhatsApp has been trying to make its platform more creative lately by leveraging the power of AI. However, it is also making a few improvements to its platform that are aimed at video and audio calling experience.  Recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-highlights-calling-experience-updates">announced</a> that the app supports "Speaker spotlight," which highlights the person talking and moves them to the front alongside audio during a screen share.</p>

<ul><li>A new report indicates Google is significantly shifting with its Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL will likely utilize the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor instead of optical sensors.</li><li>It is reportedly the same fingerprint sensor unit used in the Galaxy S24 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is launching its most awaited Pixel 9 series on August 13 — a bit earlier than usual. The devices are expected to pack a lot of upgrades, including a new design language. A new report from Android Authority indicates an exciting new upgrade is coming to the Pixel 9 series.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-fingerprint-scanner-3456801/">According to the publication</a>, which cited sources familiar with the matter, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series will opt for an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor instead of the optical sensor seen on previous iterations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. The upgrade includes all Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the debutant Pixel 9 Pro XL models. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel Fold 2</a>, on the other hand, won&apos;t feature one; instead, it will likely opt for a capacitive fingerprint sensor incorporated in the home button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="YA4fAgCHL7XyxCVkTB73oW" name="google-pixel-9-rumored-black-color-stacked.jpg" alt="The alleged Pixel 9 in a leaked rendering." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YA4fAgCHL7XyxCVkTB73oW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1685" height="948" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91Mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the switch to ultrasonic is already promising, what&apos;s more interesting is that the unit that Google is opting for is the same one seen on the Galaxy S24 series, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Ultra model</a>. It is dubbed Qualcomm 3D Sonic Gen 2 (QFS4008). The ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on the Galaxy S24 series are already known to be quicker and more reliable, unlike the optical fingerprint sensors, which had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7-fingerprint-problems-odd-workaround">their complaints</a> for the previous Pixel phones.</p><p>The publication further notes that models starting with Pixel 6 have been utilizing the optical fingerprint sensor made by Goodix. While they did the job of securing the device, they often felt slower and inaccurate than ultrasonic sensors, and moisture on hands was also an issue while unlocking the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="not8mBSoyj5br5rwPn87ZX" name="Google-Pixel-9-in-Pink-leak-01.jpeg" alt="Pixel 9 in Pink" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/not8mBSoyj5br5rwPn87ZX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Hani Mohamed Bioud on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another annoying element of the optical fingerprint sensor is its use case in low-light environments, as it is accustomed to throwing light at you when the sensor is not covered entirely.</p><p>It is encouraging to see the Pixel 9 series finally ditching them and getting the latest ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, among other nifty upgrades. One of them is a brand-new Pink colorway, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-in-pink-leaks-again-in-video">recently leaked</a> in a couple of hands-on videos. All three Pixel phones are all set to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">unveiled</a> next month.</p>

Apple had been working on this tech for years yet, despite Google&apos;s years of experience in AR and VR tech, it seemed like the company was caught unawares and without a solution of their own.</p>

<p>Fast forward to a solid year later, and neither Samsung nor Google have anything to show. We&apos;re on the even of the big annual Summer Samsung Unpacked event, where we expect to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-watch-7-spec-sheet-leak">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and the latest foldables from the company. But the one big thing we won&apos;t see is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR Headset</a>—currently a nameless product but has been called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">Samsung Glasses</a> in at least one patent.</p><p>Part of the reason is that Samsung allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-samsung-xr-prototype-used-exynos-chip">went back to the drawing board</a> after Apple Vision Pro was announced. The company was apparently planning something a bit different for its debut XR headset and wanted to be more in line with what Apple is now doing.</p><p>But the waters are dicey in the XR market right now and it&apos;s likely neither Samsung nor Google knows exactly how to push forward. Samsung Glasses are still happening, but a few setbacks have delayed its official debut.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-glasses-and-android-xr-2">Samsung Glasses and Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.86%;"><img id="kmqBBwunjFBFAwJnA2Vffk" name="samsung-flex-magic-leak.jpg" alt="An early leaked image of a Samsung XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmqBBwunjFBFAwJnA2Vffk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="395" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @PlayGamesMovies on X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Paramount to the launch of Samsung Glasses—as I&apos;ll refer to them until we get an official name—is Android XR. While this version of Android <em>also</em> doesn&apos;t have an official name just yet, we know it&apos;s a custom version of Android that Google is building specifically for AR and VR products. In other words, it&apos;s the XR equivalent of Wear OS on the best smartwatches.</p><p>It likely won&apos;t be all that different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Meta Horizon OS</a>, in essence, as the operating system that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is also built on Android. The difference is that this will be an official fork of Android, while Meta Horizon OS bears more similarities to Amazon Fire OS, another fork of Android that also stripped out all Google services.</p><p>This last point is exactly what will separate Android XR from the rest of the pack, but it&apos;s also what complicates things a bit further. Development kits have already been sent out to a select group of folks and I&apos;ve heard through the grapevine that things aren&apos;t going as expected.</p><p>In a nutshell, developers are dealing with early development kits that are proving harder to work with than everyone hoped. General stability issues and bugs always mark the early days of software development— especially on new platforms—but some thought progress on these items would be further along than they are.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung can't make a headset without Google's Android XR software, but early development kits are reportedly unstable and buggy.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>All of this seems a bit strange given how cutting-edge the Google Daydream VR platform felt back in the day, but since Google abandoned that project, it&apos;s likely they had to rebuild many things from scratch—especially given how much Android has changed at a deep level since that project was around.</p><p>I previously wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">Google lost its credibility</a> in the XR space when it dumped everything in the early 2020s, and it seems the company is trying to win folks back as much as possible by offering funding to get apps and games ported to the new Android XR platform.</p><p>That much isn&apos;t a surprise. All platforms do this to some degree, and it&apos;s an important way to help bolster an ecosystem early on. However, developers have not only been burned by Google in the past—leaving many to wonder if any efforts towards Google&apos;s platform even make sense — but it was also recently burned by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-pico-4-competition">Pico and its quick abandonment</a> as a Meta Quest competitor.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is trying to bolster its ecosystem by funding ports of apps and games, but it might not be enough to win back the trust the company lost in the early 2020s.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Android XR not only needs to be stable and work well when it makes its eventual debut, but it also needs to challenge Apple and Meta in a way that will make consumers want to choose its platform over the other two.</p><p>That brings us back to what&apos;s happening with Samsung Glasses. Recently, it&apos;s been said that Apple has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro/apple-halts-vision-pro-2-plans-to-focus-on-a-cheaper-alternative-heres-why-thats-the-right-move-as-buyers-balk-at-the-current-dollar3499-asking-price">halted Vision Pro 2 development</a> in order to focus on a less expensive headset. Samsung Glasses were already rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-apple-vision-pro-competitor-price-rumor">to be one-third the price</a> of the Vision Pro, meaning it&apos;ll debut for around $1,000 if the company stays on track.</p><p>If that&apos;s true, then it likely puts Samsung in a similar price bracket to a cheaper Apple Vision Pro. That&apos;s a good thing for everyone because it puts all headsets—Meta, Samsung, and Apple&apos;s—on a relatively level playing field. All of them would be utilizing similar resolution displays and will be powered by mobile chipsets—the current $3,500 Vision Pro uses a MacBook chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:946px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.45%;"><img id="3WofL2uvL46oMpkqhMiTjj" name="meta-quest-3s-leak.jpg" alt="A leaked promotional image of the Meta Quest 3s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WofL2uvL46oMpkqhMiTjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="946" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That would simplify things for developers looking to make the biggest return on their investment, likely giving many the ability to release apps and games on all platforms at the same time. The biggest hangup right now for multiplatform development is the lack of proper motion controller support on Apple Vision Pro, something Meta already does incredibly well, and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-xr-headset-controller-rumor">is reported to follow</a>.</p><p>But with so much up in the air, it&apos;s clear that Samsung just isn&apos;t ready to show off the goods until sometime later this year, at the earliest. Meta is rumored to launch a competition-crushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s</a> at $299 this fall, which may further muddy the waters for companies like Samsung and Google, making it difficult to find a way forward unless either company is willing to sell hardware at a loss for the sake of ecosystem growth.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up for a new product launch on July 16. It is dubbed the OnePlus Summer Launch Event and will take place in Milan, Italy. The company has started teasing it on social media, accompanying it with a teaser video saying it is a Nord product.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/summer-launch-event">teaser indicates</a> that it is a Nord product, nothing substantial has yet been revealed. However, OnePlus might launch the Nord 4, following the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-3-long-term-review">Nord 3</a>&apos;s launch in the Indian market during the same period. The company, meanwhile, has also teased it for the U.K. region. OnePlus also recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-lite-5g-launch">Nord CE 4 Lite</a> for these regions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tipster Ishan Agarwal has shared the first possible marketing renders of the OnePlus Nord 4, which, at first glance, reminds us of older Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 series smartphones. </p><p>While the color options look interesting, the Nord 4 has a dual finish on the back surrounding the dual cameras, and the rest of the device appears to have a metallic finish, which explains the teaser&apos;s emphasis on a metal build.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First look at OnePlus Nord 4 global variant and it’s serving!Love the colour options, feels fresh & I hope the thermals will be good.The bezels are razor thin too. #OnePlusNord4 pic.twitter.com/COXcDuToxU<a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1808815760581742897">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1808493070834692464">Abhishek Yadav on X</a>, the OnePlus Summer Event might bring many products, not just the Nord 4. We could also see the launch of the new OnePlus Buds 3 Pro next to the OnePlus Watch 2R.</p><p>The latter is likely a toned-down version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, launched early this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>. The approach appears similar to what we have seen with the OnePlus 12 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. It could make the upcoming Watch 2R affordable for the masses.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds 2 Pro</a> got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> as a successor, per Yadav, we might see the Pro variant at the Summer Event. On the other hand, the Nord Buds 2 are also due for a refresh, and we may be likely to see them at the event.</p>
