<ul><li>Google Translate has an Instant Translate feature that converts text from one language to another as you type.</li><li>Currently, if you use Instant Translate, you don't have access to some Google Translate tools.</li><li>A future update may bring the full slate of Google Translate features to Instant Translate mode, providing a more straightforward experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Translation apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-adds-110-new-languages">Google Translate</a>, are getting reliable enough that you can use them as a real-time translator. Part of that is due to features like Live Translate, which translates speech across languages, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Instant Translate</a>, which converts text from one language to another. </p><p>However, if you use Instant Translate, you'll lose out on a few major Google Translate features. With an upcoming software update, Instant Translate could gain full feature parity with the regular Google Translate mode.</p><p>The feature was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-richer-seamless-instant-translate-apk-teardown-3492801/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, who demonstrated the new Instant Translate functionality in the YouTube video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPqJFw9bEL0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The changes were picked up in Android Authority's teardown of the APK for <strong>v8.20.71.687383449.1</strong> of the Google Translate app. While there's no guarantee that this functionality will be released to the public, it's clear that Google is testing big changes to Instant Translate. After the team at Android Authority managed to activate the feature, they saw all the Google Translate UI elements in Instant Translate mode. </p><p>When you use the default Google Translate mode in the mobile app, you have a lot of features at your fingertips. You can translate text, of course, but the user interface packs many more tools. For starters, the output can be spoken and copied. There will also be definitions and grammar suggestions that will help you understand the way words and phrases differ across languages.</p><p>The unfortunate part of using Instant Translate is that all these tools go away when this mode is activated. It'll convert text from one language to another as you type in real-time, but the above actions — from speaking to copying — are unavailable until you exit Instant Translate. That is, for now. The upcoming version of the Google Translate app could bring all the above functionality to Instant Translate mode, making it one of the best ways to use the app. </p><p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes to Instant Translate are available to users of the Google Translate app soon. In addition to the new functionality for Instant Translate, the report notes that Google Translate may add the ability to recover a recently deleted translation. </p>

<hr>
<p>Whether or not you have any interest in owning or riding in a self-driving car, Qualcomm says that its automaker clients want to pack their cars with more AI technology. With its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite, the company is promising ambitious, futuristic AI capabilities that hover between exciting and science-fiction.</p><p>Available starting in 2025, the 2nd-gen Cockpit Elite uses the same Oryon CPU tech found in its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> CPUs—which were announced yesterday at the Qualcomm Summit—with 3X the CPU performance of the last Snapdragon Cockpit. It also sports a Hexagon NPU with 12X-boosted AI and an Adreno GPU capable of supporting an absurd 16 4K displays simultaneously in one car, as well as "real-time ray tracing" and "immersive 3D experiences" for "critical visual information."</p><p>I asked the Qualcomm team why any car would need that much graphical power; they explained that this allows your car's infotainment display to span the entire front dashboard while still leaving processing power for TVs on seatbacks for passengers and graphical augmentations on your side mirrors.</p><p>Presumably, non-autonomous vehicles wouldn't need as many distracting screens, but luxury automakers would have that option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-cockpit-elite-zonal-audio" alt="Graphic showing "AI-enabled zonal audio" and what the Snapdragon Cockpit/ Ride Elite SoC looks like." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZHqzrNr8zvEkHstLNKj9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The boosted CPU supports simultaneous tasks like navigation, music, calling, and gaming simultaneously. But the flashy star of Cockpit Elite, unsurprisingly, is the AI tech.</p><p>Qualcomm says its Hexagon NPU is "built to handle Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters." Each car's specific hands-free assistant would be trained on the car's manual so you could, for example, ask what a warning light means.</p><p>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite would also "learn and adapt to your preferences," Qualcomm claims, and even "take actions automatically." This part of the presentation felt looser on hard details; I asked what exact preferences the AI could learn, and heard examples like your car routing you home without your input if you usually do so at that time. It could also recognize which backup route you like to take during heavy traffic, or guide another driver (like your spouse) towards your usual parking spot.</p><p>In addition, Snapdragon Elite would recognize the number of passengers and change its usual patterns accordingly, like preventing phone notifications if someone else could hear them or using "zonal audio" to localize relevant audio to the driver while focusing on music for the passengers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kctCsTVt8Fnsnbcj6JLdG" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-ride-elite-ai" alt="An explainer slide showing how AI tech would work in a car for Snapdragon Ride Elite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kctCsTVt8Fnsnbcj6JLdG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Ride Elite, which essentially pairs with Cockpit Elite as a single SoC for self-driving cars.</p><p>Ride Elite supports up to 40 sensors, including multiple 16MP cameras with 360º FoV and passenger-facing infrared cameras. It's meant to capture signs, lanes, and objects clearly, as well as recognize passenger gestures.</p><p>It simultaneously supports radar/lidar point-cloud processing, automotive security when parked, and other behavioral AI tricks like auto-rerouting around accidents, self-guided parking, and opening your sunroof depending on the weather.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.12%;"><img id="usTR5AxzY3vLupqkWqjPwB" name="Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite Infographic" alt="An infographic showing how the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite compare against the 1st-gen "non-Elite" models for CPU, GPU, NPU, and other features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/usTR5AxzY3vLupqkWqjPwB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1668" height="936" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All combined, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite seem to promise smarts that are good enough to power the talking AI car from Knight Rider. We'll have to see how much a powerful SoC like this costs, both for automakers and for consumers, and whether the ambitious AI promises actually lead to helpful automation for drivers.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music could be working on support for clamshell foldable phones to refine its user experience.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-now-playing-widget-galaxy-z-flip-cover-display-apk-teardown-3492702/">Android Authority</a>, the YouTube Music mobile app&apos;s latest version (v7.24.51) holds clues that point toward a "FlipWidgetProvider." The publication conducted an APK teardown of the app and found a string that directly mentions a widget for a "flip" device, which is reportedly confirmed to be Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>The post states the app&apos;s code shows that the "music player" widget can be enabled via <strong>Settings > Cover Screen > Widgets </strong>once YouTube rolls it out. Users may find this useful as such a widget isn&apos;t supported on the Flip series. However, it <em>is </em>on your standard slab phone like the Galaxy S24 series for the home screen. The widget gives options like play/pause, skip forward/back, and thumbs up/down options.</p><p>With its expected arrival on the Flip series&apos; cover display, users can have enhanced access to their music <em>without </em>opening the phone. Considering the size of the Galaxy Z Flip cover display, this widget will give users more mileage. Speaking of, it&apos;s unclear which devices will grab YouTube Music&apos;s widget support.</p><p>The widget will likely debut on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>; however, it&apos;s unclear how far back Samsung is willing to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hTUG84r5j64bMjQgCgnSjF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung dubbed the larger screen of its Flip series the "Flex Window" when the Flip 5 launched in 2023. It was clear from the beginning that the "window" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">needed to be more flexible</a>. Users couldn&apos;t open any app they wanted on the cover display. Samsung implemented a "curated, optimized experience," limiting your options. Originally, the Flip 5&apos;s cover screen supported the following apps: Google Messages, Samsung Messages, WhatsApp, YouTube, Netflix, and Google Maps.</p><p>The ability to open more apps was tucked behind Samsung&apos;s Good Lock app launcher. The launcher gave users control over almost every app they had. This YouTube Music widget with Flex Window support will likely give users a more refined music control experience.</p><p>In other news, YouTube Music was busy rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">a Gemini Extension</a> for desktop and Android users.

<hr>
<p>After teasing us with the announcement that Circle to Search is coming to its phones, Motorola is finally launching the feature on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">2024 Razr series</a> via a new update rolling out now.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and the more affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> are currently receiving a new update, which seems to be a regular security and stability update at first glance. The update release notes only mention the September 2024 security patch and stability improvements, but nothing else. However, after I finished installing the update, Circle to Search was live on both phones.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is a simple way to search what's on your screen by pressing and holding the navigation bar and circling or selecting specific items. The feature works with images, text, and even audio, and it can translate what's on your screen in a pinch. Think of it as a more accessible Google Lens.</p><p>The feature has been exclusive to Pixel and Samsung phones since its launch earlier this year but has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-steps-up-to-challenge-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-with-this-ai-feature">recently started arriving on more phones</a>.</p><p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-is-finally-catching-up-to-samsung-with-these-ai-features">previously stated</a> that Circle to Search would be available on its devices, but the company neglected to state which devices would get the feature or when. We asked for clarification, but so far we have not received an answer. That said, it appears the 2023 Razr models have not received Circle to Search after receiving the most recent software update.</p><p>As for the models that did receive it, the feature is enabled by default, so you can start circling and searching after the phone reboots. To disable Circle to Search, navigate to <strong>Settings > Gestures > System navigation</strong>, where you'll find an option to toggle the feature off.</p>

<p>The update comes in at 1.05GB for the Razr Plus but just under 1GB for the Razr 2024.</p><p>Aside from Circle to Search, I also caught that the quick settings menu has a very pronounced fading effect when swiping out of it, something I didn't notice before. Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything else of note.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-of-many-2">The first of many?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj" name="Moto-AI-features-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-3.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Curiously, this is the first update I've received since the phone launched in July, and that's not from a lack of checking. Motorola, while not being the best with timely updates, is usually good at keeping its bi-monthly cadence, which was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>.</p><p>It's possible the company was preparing to add the feature and thus delayed the update. Still, it's nice to see the feature being added so quickly after other OEMs like Honor are also getting Circle to Search.</p><p>In the meantime, Motorola is also preparing to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">new Moto AI features</a> to its phones. At Lenovo Tech World 2024, the company revealed that these features were currently in beta and being tested with a small group of Razr 50/Ultra and Edge 50 Ultra users. However, the beta would be extended by the end of the year for more users.</p><p>These features will be able to summarize your notifications, remember conversations, recall images, and more. Motorola is also testing a Large Action Model (LAM) that essentially navigates apps on your behalf, doing things like ordering coffee and booking an Uber, although this is only a proof-of-concept at the moment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that Circle to Search is live on the Razr, hopefully Motorola's update cadence will improve. We also expect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> to arrive on Motorola phones at some point, but Motorola has been pretty mum regarding its update plans. So far, at least one Motorola phone has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-edge-50-fusion-gets-android-15-beta">already received the Android 15 beta</a>, which is a good sign.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a super affordable phone that doesn&apos;t compromise too much; battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a device that&apos;s going to come with years of Android updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a phone with top-tier performance; you want something with a headphone jack.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is a no-frills, budget-friendly phone. That&apos;s why we&apos;ve chosen it as our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones#section-best-for-galaxy-fans">best cheap Android phone for Galaxy fans</a>, and this price makes it look even more appealing. We love the A35&apos;s 6.5-inch AMOLED display, which sports a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as its solid battery life backed by a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>This phone also comes with 128GB of storage, a microSD port for expandable storage of up to 1TB, and four years of Android updates.</p><p>While we do like the A35, it&apos;s worth noting that you can&apos;t expect it to perform as well as Samsung&apos;s premium offerings. Performance certainly isn&apos;t going to blow anyone away with just 6GB of RAM and the Exynos 1380 processor, but this is a price point that&apos;s truly hard to beat for what&apos;s being offered.</p>

<ul><li>Leaks surface about the Pixel 9a's cameras and suggest its primary lens could drop to 48MP from the Pixel 8a's 64MP.</li><li>The ultrawide and selfie cameras are rumored to remain at 13MP.</li><li>A drop in camera strength was speculated, especially following Google's Director of Design's comments about why the Pixel 9's visor was so large.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors have surfaced regarding the camera strength of Google's next budget Pixel — and we can't say we're surprised.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> featured a camera worthy of champ status, but the latest rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-camera-specs">Android Headlines</a> claim its successor might see a sharp change. According to its post, the Google Pixel 9a is rumored to debut with a 48MP primary lens instead of the strong 64MP of its soon-to-be predecessor.</p><p>The next budget phone is suspected to arrive with a dual camera array, with the second lens being an ultrawide sensor like the Pixel 8a. The publication purports the Pixel 9a will continue that trend at 13MP. The post adds that the centered punch-hole selfie camera will likely stick with 13MP, too.</p><p>If the Pixel 9a sticks with the same sensors as last year, we might know what to expect. The Pixel 8a's ultrawide sensor features OIS (optical image stabilization), an <em>f</em>/2.2 aperture, and a 120-degree FOV. On the other hand, the selfie camera also features an <em>f</em>/2.2 aperture with a 95-degree FOV.</p><p>The publication then claims the Pixel 9a's rumored 48MP primary sensor is the same one Google gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. The company's foldable successor offers a 1/2-inch primary sensor with an <em>f</em>/1.7 aperture, OIS+EIS, and an 82-degree wide-angle view.</p><p>Moreover, rumors state the budget Pixel will feature the flagship Pixel 9 series' "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>" feature. The company debuted this during its keynote which, in layman's terms, is a function that pastes one snapshot onto another, giving the illusion that it was taken in one go. Add Me lets users get in on group photos as the photographer is typically the one that gets left out.</p>

<p>These camera rumors give us something to think about following the surprising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">alleged imagery</a> of the Pixel 9a. The renders showed the device missing an iconic Google symbol: its large camera visor. It seems the Pixel 9a will offer a camera housing flush to its back panel with its LED flash nestled directly to its right.</p><p>The potential camera strength of this device was in question, especially after Google defended the massive Pixel 9 series bump.</p><p>The company's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">credited consumer interest</a> in photography and videography for the massive bump. People want to take better pictures/videos, but that comes at the cost of requiring larger sensors and lenses. This fact alone pushed what's possible for a camera array's thickness, which is why its recent Pixel 9 series housing is so pronounced.</p><p>With rumors consistently showing a Pixel 9a with a flush array, it makes sense why follow-up speculation drops its primary camera strength.</p><p>Other rumors state the budget Pixel could offer an 8/128GB (RAM/storage) configuration and a slightly larger battery than the Pixel 8a's 4,492mAh. Speculation about its display continues as rumors originally claimed 6.1 inches. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-dimension-display-size-rumors">a recent suggests</a> the display <em>could </em>increase to 6.2 or 6.3 inches.</p><p>The Pixel 9a may debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>A report states Xiaomi's recent flagship phones utilize a unique co-processor that supports a snappier, more responsive Fast Pair.</li><li>Xiaomi's 14T Pro features CHRE (Context Hub Runtime Environment) support alongside other devices like the 14T and the 14 series.</li><li>The report states Xiaomi can do more with CHRE support, like potentially adding crash detection.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery inside one of Xiaomi&apos;s recent flagship phones shows that a special chip is being put to work to make device pairing easy.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-fast-pair-on-chre-3492633/">Android Authority</a>) discovered "CHRE" support while examining the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro</a> code. The support was confirmed after an "android.hardware.context_hub" flag was found. According to Rahman, all of this refers to Google&apos;s Context Hub Runtime Environment, a specific Android API that "offloads" certain OS tasks, like Fast Pairing, to an ultra low-power co-processor.</p><p>More digging shows the 14T Pro contains a preloaded "nanoapp" called Google Nearby. The app enables Fast Pair discovery to run on CHRE.</p><p>In short, support for the context hub and the Google Nearby app makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fast-pair-bluetooth">Fast Pair</a> snappier and more responsive when called. Additionally, Rahman states Xiaomi could take things further with its CHRE support, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel">adding crash detection</a> and more.</p><p>CHRE support and the nanoapp were also discovered on the Xiaomi 14 series, 14T, and the POCO F6 series.</p><p>Rahman adds that the preloaded Nearby app is a "connectivity library" for Fast Pair <em>and </em>Quick Share. Supposedly Google stated CHRE was intended to "improve the responsiveness" of Quick Share, though it&apos;s unclear if support for such advancements has arrived.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VJLNPqbRSbFtvBvFoPnAsG" name="xiaomi-14t-pro-18.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14T Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJLNPqbRSbFtvBvFoPnAsG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s Fast Pair technology already made it easier for consumers to link Bluetooth-supported accessories with their phones. CHRE takes things further by making that "within range" necessity more responsive. Aside from devices like earbuds, Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-nest-matter-rollout-android-fast-pair">Fast Pair for Matter-supported</a> devices through Google Home.</p><p>A consumer&apos;s Home, Home Mini, or even Nest Hub Max would serve as the Matter hub. Fast Pair technology makes the onboarding process much faster when weaving new devices into your smart home ecosystem.</p><p>On Xiaomi&apos;s side, it seems likely that the company will continue CHRE support once its next phone, the 15 series, debuts. The company was in Hawaii yesterday (Oct 21) at Qualcomm&apos;s Summit 2024 to discuss what consumers can expect. Xiaomi&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">SVP Adam Zeng announced</a> that the 15 series will be the first phone to feature Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC globally. The device will be paired with the company&apos;s HyperCore technology to reduce internal core temperatures and power consumption.</p><p>Moreover, the Xiaomi 15 series is slated to debut "at the end of October."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm's coming-out party for custom Oryon silicon in smartphones and its sophomore effort with a major AI focus. But something that I think "normal" phone buyers will care about, even more than benchmarks and GenAI tricks, is whether the Elite's 44% efficiency boost will actually make their phone batteries last longer.</p><p>It's a fair question because the Snapdragon 8 Elite is the first flagship chip we know of that completely abandons traditional efficiency cores.</p><p>Up until now, Snapdragon, MediaTek Dimensity, Samsung Exynos, Google Tensor, and even Apple Bionic SoCs have used efficiency cores — typically 3–4 clocked around 2GHz. Qualcomm stuck six 3.53GHz Oryon cores into the Snapdragon 8 Elite instead. I naturally wondered how this would impact battery life and if other brands still use efficiency cores for a reason.</p><p>While attending the Snapdragon Summit in Maui, I took a layman's approach and asked several Snapdragon product team members (A) why phones don't seem to get more efficient every year to match their CPUs and (B) why the Snapdragon 8 Elite doesn't need efficiency cores. I got some very illuminating answers.</p>
<h2 id="your-phone-s-efficiency-and-snapdragon-s-efficiency-are-two-different-things-2">Your phone's 'efficiency' and Snapdragon's 'efficiency' are two different things</h2>
<p>Apple, MediaTek, and Samsung have slowly made their efficiency cores more powerful year over year. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> boosted these small cores from 2GHz to 2.4GHz, a significant gap, but it still <em>uses</em> these low-clocked cores for battery efficiency.</p><p>Then you have the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is 44% better for power efficiency than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. In practice, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">new Xiaomi 15</a> coming in late October is reportedly 29.7% more efficient and runs 3ºC cooler than the Xiaomi 14, thanks to the 8 Elite.</p><p>Promising, right? But look back at past keynotes, and you'll see that the Gen 3 was 20% more efficient than the Gen 2...which was 40% more efficient than the Gen 1 CPU, which in turn beat the Snapdragon 888 by 30%.</p><p>The same applies to GPU gains: You saw a 45% boost from Gen 1 to 2, 25% from Gen 2 to 3, and now 40% from Gen 3 to Elite. The 8 Elite's camera ISP is 25% more efficient than last year and the NPU is 45% more power efficient for AI tasks.</p><p>Shouldn't all this efficiency translate into a phone that lasts significantly longer? Not necessarily!</p>

<p>Qualcomm, MediaTek, and OEMs judge efficiency by testing how much power the newer SoC uses to hit the <em>old</em> top benchmark of the last-gen chip. It's a legitimate comparison, your new 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> won't naturally stop there; it'll hit the <em>new</em> benchmark—maybe 20–40% higher—which naturally requires more power.</p><p>The Snapdragon Summit showed off demos with LLM functions, gaming physics engines, and other tech that fully tax the CPU, GPU, and NPU. Although the tech may be more efficient, it'll still be optimized to take the 8 Elite to its power limit.</p><p>Everyday tasks will require less battery than before, true. But when I asked a Qualcomm engineer why efficiency gains don't lead to longer smartphone battery life, he emphasized that SoC efficiency can't counterbalance a large, bright, fast-refreshing display, frequent 5G computing in an area with spotty reception, or other battery-killing design choices.</p><p>That's why you shouldn't expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> or other future Snapdragon 8 Elite phones to have massive battery gains. OEMs will optimize their phones to use that 44% efficiency boost to improve in other areas.</p>
<h2 id="why-efficiency-cores-are-becoming-obsolete-2">Why 'efficiency' cores are becoming obsolete</h2>
<p>Now that we've established that phone battery life is more complicated than simply making the SoC more efficient, should we be worried that Qualcomm abandoned its efficiency cores? Will its six cores clocked to 3.53GHz do as well as 2GHz cores for handling low-demand tasks, or would they naturally burn more battery?</p><p>At breakfast, before the Snapdragon Summit keynote, Shahin Farahani, senior product manager for the Snapdragon 8 Elite, happened to sit at my table. So, I took advantage and asked these questions.</p><p>Farahani explained that their previous flagship SoCs had already begun to cut down on efficiency cores—only two in the Gen 3, for instance—but that the shift to Oryon made it possible to cut them entirely because when they graphed their 3.53GHz cores against Arm efficiency cores for low-power tasks, Oryon did "equally" well with no loss of power.</p><p>He pushed back against the usual performance/efficiency binary, saying that the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance cores set for low-power tasks could be <em>called</em> efficiency cores but that it would make people assume they were "weak." He preferred calling the old cores "silver" quality and the new ones "gold" quality, or simply "mid-range" and "large" cores instead of performance and prime.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">No 'efficiency cores' in sight, but the performance cores <em>are</em> efficient. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then I sat down for a small media Q&A on the new Snapdragon 8 Elite CPU with Qualcomm Senior Director Karl Whealton and asked about its lack of efficiency cores one more time for good measure.</p><p>At first, he focused on the technical side of things, bringing up the concepts of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution">out-of-order execution </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution">speculative execution</a> when discussing the cost-benefit of performance cores over efficiency cores.</p><p>Essentially, swapping in a performance core requires an increase in area, wire length, power consumption, and leakage, as well as an increase in speculative waste. They had to "make sure" that the trade-offs justified the performance gains. And that wasn't always true since "it's so unusual you can actually force eight instructions through in a single cycle." That's why it made sense to keep using a few efficiency cores instead of superfluous, wasteful performance cores.</p><p>So what changed?</p><p>"It turns out that if you can lower the voltage to minimize energy consumption per operation...higher performance was getting to be more and more worth it," Whealton explained.</p><p>"A performance core operating at a lower voltage—or sometimes even duty cycling to turn off the core completely—that started to get more efficient than the smaller cores."</p><p>It basically reiterated Farahani's earlier point: Oryon cores at low voltage are just as efficient as efficiency cores or can simply be turned off if unneeded but can <em>also</em> boost to higher clock speeds in a pinch. The "equation around [efficiency cores'] utility had changed," Whealton said.</p>
<hr>
<p>We'll have to wait and test phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-magic-7-series-is-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-and-it-comes-with-an-on-device-autopilot-ai">Honor Magic 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-asus-rog-phone-9-is-dropping-in-november-and-could-be-the-fastest-phone-around">ROG Phone 9</a> to see if the Snapdragon 8 Elite lives up to Qualcomm's lofty claims, both for power and efficiency. It could be that Oryon silicon has issues we don't know about yet.</p><p>But I assume Qualcomm wouldn't ditch efficiency cores unless it could be certain the new architecture wouldn't backfire on them. And Whealton said during our Q&A that "across the industry, other people are starting to drop them out." Even if it takes MediaTek and Samsung longer to phase them out, they'll probably follow in Qualcomm's footsteps and abolish the idea of needing efficiency cores to be efficient.</p><p>Hopefully, that'll mean more powerful Android phones across brands in the future—even if we'll have to keep waiting for <em>longer-lasting</em> Android phones.</p>

<p>Samsung Health is becoming one of the best health and wellness platforms on Android, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch</a> integration and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to make sense of all the data. Now, the company wants to show you more information in the Samsung Health app, it shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-health-app-update-makes-accessing-health-records-managing-medications-and-food-tracking-easier" target="_blank">press release</a>. It's doing so by adding a few new features and forming a partnership with a platform that aggregates data from some of the largest electronic medical record (EMR) systems in the U.S.</p><p>On top of that, Samsung Health is making medication tracking and meal logging easier, requiring only the use of a smartphone camera. These features are region-limited, but they're available on Android 10+ devices in version 6.28 or higher of the Samsung Health app.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XXfcA6q6ay8W5y6kBDnHBQ" name="Samsung-Health-Records.jpg" alt="Medical records in the Samsung Health app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XXfcA6q6ay8W5y6kBDnHBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Health records are at the heart of the Samsung Health improvements, thanks to a partnership with b.well Connected Health. Samsung says that b.well Connected Health collects data from many of the largest EMR systems in the U.S., including athenahealth, Cerner Health, Epic Systems and Veradigm. Users with health data stored in these systems and their health networks can view their medical records, lab results, and more directly in the Samsung Health app.</p><p>As you can see in the simulated Samsung Health app screenshots above, the company is presenting this data in a clear and concise way that should be easy for users to understand. It's similar to how vital statistics and other health information recorded by Samsung wearables are shown in the app.</p><p>The company says it aims to provide insights and recommendations based on the data, with an emphasis on preventative care. It won't try to diagnose you, but it may recommend you get a test or see a doctor to learn more about a concerning medical record or lab result.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L5mDwfePzrxN3KtbxDKLpP" name="Samsung-Health-Medications.jpg" alt="Medication tracking in the Samsung Health app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5mDwfePzrxN3KtbxDKLpP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Medication is not new to the Samsung Health app; it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-health-medications">introduced in the U.S. last year</a>. However, adding medications to the platform will become a lot easier with a feature called visual search. You can use your phone's camera to scan a medication label and have it automatically added to Samsung Health. From there, you can monitor your medications, get dosage schedules, and receive notifications when you've missed a dose.</p><p>The feature is coming to South Korea and India, too. Users in India can be notified when they need a refill and request one online with the Samsung Health app, thanks to a partnership with Tata 1mg, a top digital healthcare platform in the country.</p><p>Medication warnings will be available in the U.S. and South Korea, supported by Elsevier and the Korea Pharmaceutical Information Center (KPIC). It could help warn users about allergies, reactions, or medications to avoid while pregnant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xbxWZ3on8EU5nCjgvWRZVP" name="Samsung-Health-Meal-Recording.jpg" alt="Meal logging functionality in the Samsung Health app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbxWZ3on8EU5nCjgvWRZVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, meal logging in the Samsung Health app is set to become effortless now that users can scan food barcode labels with their phone's camera. Pulling nutritional information from the Fatsecret database, you'll be able to see data from the food you eat in the Samsung Health app with a quick barcode scan. To start, this feature will be available in the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland.</p><p>Of course, you should carefully consider what health data you wish to share with third-party companies. The more companies you give health records to, the greater the risk of these records being leaked in a data breach. However, for those who feel comfortable sharing their health records and medical information with Samsung Health, these three new features will be abundantly useful. They aim to take medical records that could be confusing to the average person and present them in a way anyone can understand.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced a slew of upgrades to YouTube and YouTube Music last week, including support for custom playlist thumbnails.</li><li>Previously, users could ask generative AI to create a thumbnail for them, but could not upload their own.</li><li>Now, users are starting to see the feature appear in the YouTube Music web player after verifying their phone number. Mobile app support seems to be coming later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music" target="_blank">YouTube Music</a> are getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-and-youtube-music-gain-new-improvements">a few new features</a> this month, and a big one is starting to roll out: custom playlist thumbnails. YouTube Music is a formidable competitor to Apple Music and Spotify, especially if you already pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a>. However, it sometimes lacks core features that we take for granted in other music streaming apps. Now, YouTube Music is catching up to its competition by letting users upload their own photos and artwork as playlist thumbnails.</p><p>The feature is appearing widely for YouTube Music users on the platform's web player, found at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://music.youtube.com" target="_blank">music.youtube.com</a>. The rollout was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/youtube-music-playlist-thumbnail/" target="_blank">first spotted by 9to5Google</a>, and it appears to be limited to the YouTube Music web client for the time being. Additionally, YouTube seems to be requiring users to verify their phone numbers before uploading photos. If you're not seeing the option for custom thumbnails, check that your phone is verified.</p><p>After opening a playlist, you can tap on the pencil icon to select a photo from your phone, tablet, or computer. The web client offers a built-in cropping tool, allowing you to resize your custom image to fit the playlist's square aspect ratio. After that, you're all set — but you can tap the pencil icon and select <strong>Remove custom image</strong> to revert your changes at any time. </p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a>, like Apple Music and Spotify, have offered custom playlist thumbnails for quite a while, allowing users to personalize their playlists as they see fit. The custom playlist thumbnails are perhaps more useful to YouTube Music subscribers, but they're also available on YouTube, as Google showcases in the video below. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, YouTube has offered a way for users to personalize their playlist thumbnails since 2023, but it has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-generative-ai-art-experiment">limited to AI-generated artwork</a>. Being that playlists are always made with a personal touch, using your own photos feels like a natural choice. </p><p>Luckily, YouTube Music subscribers don't have to feel envious of other streaming services with the emergence of custom playlist thumbnails on the platform. Next, we'll be keeping our eye out to see if the feature makes its way to the YouTube Music mobile app, or if there are any limitations.</p>
