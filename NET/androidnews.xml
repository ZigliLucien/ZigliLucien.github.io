                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The last time I used an external HDD was back in college; I had two 3.5-inch external HDDs to store most of the data, but I wanted something that was portable and didn&apos;t need an auxiliary power source, so I got a 2.5-inch Western Digital drive. It was decent enough at the beginning, but it didn&apos;t take long for the connector to start acting up — it would lose connection every time I looked at it — and the drive was <em>slow </em>even by early 2010s standards.</p>

<p>Using the drive made me realize I needed a long-term solution that was actually reliable, and that&apos;s how I got started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS servers</a> — in a sense, I should be thankful I picked up that drive. Anyway, my data these days is housed entirely in NAS servers, and I use a smattering of external SSDs if I need storage on the go. As such, I haven&apos;t paid much attention to external HDDs, but given that they still sell in considerable numbers, I wanted to see if things have changed.</p><p>I got started with Seagate&apos;s Ultra Touch and LaCie Mobile Drive, and both have proven to be highly reliable in just over a month of use. The Ultra Touch in particular is very intriguing; Seagate uses 30% post-consumer materials in the chassis, and the drive itself is small enough that you can just throw it (gently) in a bag. The biggest plus point is that it connects over USB-C, and I had zero issues using it with my Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JLAGtS7HafaCuxtZKXqXdW" name="seagate-ultra-touch-4.jpg" alt="Seagate Ultra Touch external HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLAGtS7HafaCuxtZKXqXdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other niceties include AES-256 encryption, giving you the ability to easily safeguard the data on the drive. There is no audible noise when using the drive, and even after transferring a sizeable chunk of data, it didn&apos;t get too hot. </p><p>While there has been a lot of innovation in the HDD segment in recent years — including helium-encased drives and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/30tb-hard-drives-with-hamr-tech-are-now-a-reality-and-im-thrilled">emergence of HAMR tech</a> — that has all been aimed at 3.5-inch options, and 2.5-inch drives are relatively unchanged. The only key difference is that most of these drives now connect over USB-C.</p><p>I tested the Ultra Touch extensively over the course of the last month, and the drive routinely averaged transfers of 135MB/s, which is more than adequate if you just need a reliable drive for daily use. Granted, an external SSD will go up to 660MB/s on average when transferring data from an internal NVMe drive.</p>

<p>But there&apos;s another factor at play, and that is pricing. The Ultra Touch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Touch-External-Drive/dp/B0BN4DXRC6/">costs $165 for the 5TB version</a>, and that comes out to $33/terabyte. There isn&apos;t an equivalent SSD, but the Crucial X9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-4TB-Portable-CT4000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0C9WGQY8G">will set you back by $260</a> if you get the 4TB model, coming out to $65/terabyte — double that of the HDD.</p><p>Obviously, an external SSD has much faster transfers, is noticeably smaller, and will last longer. But if you want to maximize storage value, an external HDD still has a lot to offer in 2024. I&apos;ll be conducting long-term tests to see how these drives measure up as that will be a better indicator to their reliability, but if you have a lot of data and are looking to get an external drive for archival, the Ultra Touch ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<hr>
<p>Huawei will be fully moving away from Android apps on its devices with the next version of HarmonyOS, called HarmonyOS Next. The new version of Huawei’s in-house operating system was previewed this week at HDC 2024, the company’s developer conference. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/21/huawei-unveils-harmonyos-next-star-shield-security-harmony-intelligence/" target="_blank">GizmoChina</a>, HarmonyOS Next will leave behind the Android Open Source Project, and will instead be built on Huawei’s custom architecture. </p><p>The decision comes with some significant consequences. After losing support for Google apps a few years ago due to economic sanctions, Huawei devices will now lose support for Android apps altogether. A big benefit to using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a> is compatibility with Android apps. Developers can tweak the AOSP as they see fit, but still benefit from the exhaustive list of apps built on AOSP architecture.</p><p>As extreme examples, both the Humane AI Pin and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> are built on the AOSP architecture. They’re not Android devices in the conventional sense, but they use the AOSP codebase. That means they are <em>technically</em> compatible with Android apps. It’s how tinkerers were able to crack the Rabbit R1 and load up Android launchers and apps on the device with no translation, emulation, or other extreme efforts required.</p><p>Since HarmonyOS is built on AOSP, it can download and install Android apps. That will change when HarmonyOS Next releases with Huawei’s custom architecture. Developers will need to be ported to the Hongmeng kernel and system, according to GizmoChina. This process has been underway since 2023, but it’s unclear how many apps are available on HarmonyOS Next right now. The company says that popular apps Taobao, Yiche, and Bilibili are all running natively on the platform. </p><p>The move might work in China, as many apps are consolidated and offer many functions in the same place. For example, WeChat is the world’s largest standalone mobile app and serves as a messaging service, social media platform, and mobile payments provider. It’s effectively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, Facebook/Instagram, and PayPal all in one — if we’re comparing WeChat to its Western equivalents. So, if Huawei got a handful of core apps on HarmonyOS Next, it could be successful even without Android app support. </p><p>Due to sanctions from the U.S. and other governments, Huawei phones haven’t been a viable consideration for most people outside of China for years. That becomes even more true now that Android apps will be left behind completely when HarmonyOS Next launches.</p><p>However, it’s not ready yet. Huawei says that HarmonyOS Next is currently in the beta testing stage and is looking for roughly 3,000 developers and beta testers. It’s been a slow and steady development process for HarmonyOS Next, and that‘s unsurprising. This will be a significant Huawei and comes with a lot of risk.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UAgv43UcAZsxRcRfcqq3p" name="Huawei-P60-Pro.jpg" alt="Huawei P60 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAgv43UcAZsxRcRfcqq3p.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the broader circumstances Huawei is facing, the move to build HarmonyOS on its own architecture over the Android Open Source Project actually makes a lot of sense. The aforementioned sanctions have limited Huawei’s ability to source equipment needed to create cutting-edge processors. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)</a>, which designs and fabricates Huawei chips, can’t import equipment due to U.S. sanctions and treaties with other countries. </p><p>Something called an Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machine allows chipmakers to produce faster and better chips than they could using older Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) equipment. That‘s why Huawei’s latest smartphone chip was made using the 7nm process, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has already developed mobile chips using the 3nm process.</p><p>There are reports that SMIC may be able to make 5nm chips using the DUV equipment it has, though it would be costly and inefficient. Either way, Huawei‘s chips would still be behind the competition.</p><p>Moving to a custom HarmonyOS Next version built on its own architecture could increase efficiency and make the most out of its meager microprocessors. In fact, that’s exactly what Huawei is hoping for. The company says HarmonyOS Next will bring 30% faster performance overall and a 20% lower power draw. Ditching AOSP, then, could be a good thing. If Huawei can deliver top-notch performance using HarmonyOS Next and get crucial developers onboard, Huawei users in China might not miss Android apps. </p><p>Still, this decision highlights the difficulties Huawei has faced since it was sanctioned massively by the U.S. government and others. If the company had access to state-of-the-art equipment, international sales, and Google apps, perhaps it wouldn’t need to move away from the Android Open Source Project. However, when you consider what Huawei’s options are, choosing competitive overall performance and battery life over expanded app support may be the right move. </p>

<ul><li>Continuous scrolling on Google Search was introduced for mobile in October 2021 and expanded to desktop in late 2022, and now, it's being phased out for both.</li><li>Google Search users will return to a more structured search experience with the pagination bar.</li><li>Desktop users will use the "next" button or jump to specific pages, while mobile users will have a "more results" button.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is ending its infinite scroll feature for search results, according to Search Engine Land. This change means users will go back to a more structured search experience.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-search-continuous-scrolling-update">rolling out continuous scrolling for mobile searches in October 2021</a>, Google expanded this feature to desktop searches by late 2022. Borrowing a concept popularized by social media, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/5-cool-google-search-features-you-didnt-know-about">Google Search</a> allowed users to effortlessly browse through an endless stream of content, encouraging passive exploration.</p><p>A Google spokesperson told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://searchengineland.com/google-dropping-continuous-scroll-in-search-results-443529" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a> that the company has now stopped continuous scrolling for desktop search results. Later this month, it will also end infinite scrolling on mobile search results.</p><p>In a statement to the outlet, Google explained why it&apos;s discontinuing infinite scrolling for search results. The change aims to improve loading times by stopping the automatic pre-loading of results users might not want. Google&apos;s data also showed that, despite encouraging exploration, infinite scrolling didn&apos;t lead to a better user experience.</p><p>Moving away from infinite scroll means bringing back the familiar pagination bar at the bottom of search results. Desktop users can now use the "next" button or jump to specific pages. Likewise, mobile users will see a "more results" button, allowing for more intentional search navigation.</p><p>Since continuous scrolling was introduced just a few years ago, most users will likely find the return to the pagination bar quite familiar.</p><p>The shift away from infinite scrolling has ignited debates about its impact on user behavior and website traffic. SEO experts have long advised that results beyond the first page get minimal clicks. Infinite scroll improved visibility for lower-ranked sites by displaying more results seamlessly. With pagination making a comeback, it will be interesting to see if traffic to those lower-ranked sites decreases.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp beta version 2.24.14.5 brings a new shortcut to the video messaging experience.</li><li>A few testers have spotted this shortcut, which lets them quickly respond to video messages by tapping it instead of opening the app's old menu.</li><li>WhatsApp recently started a test for a default option to send photos and videos in HD quality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest WhatsApp beta is reportedly improving the texting experience with video messages in chat threads.</p><p>A dive into version <strong>2.24.14.5</strong> of the WhatsApp beta on Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-14-5-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> discovered a new shortcut for video message replies (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-quickly-reply-to-instant-video-messages/">Android Police</a>). The beta now displays a small icon beside a video message, which looks like a camera with a reply arrow moving left.</p><p>An update like this should breathe a little more convenience into the previous video replying system. WhatsApp requires users to rediscover a video manually and head into its menu before creating their reply. The shortcut cuts out the extra steps by offering a quick, easy-to-tap button to reply and send.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when this update will arrive for all stable users of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, however, the new beta version is available via the Play Store.</p><p>The post adds that the quick reply shortcut is appearing for "some" testers, meaning its rollout is still ongoing, and more should see it as the week progresses.</p>

<p>This beta version marks the second iterative update to improve the video experience in WhatsApp as another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-finally-lets-you-send-hd-photos-and-videos-by-default">boosted its quality</a>. Appearing in beta version 2.24.13.10 earlier in June, the service tested an option to set the default quality of uploads as HD. Testing showed that WhatsApp intends to allow HD uploads of photos <em>and </em>videos once its testing concludes.</p><p>The move to bring videos into the mix is likely due to the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-hd-photos">HD photo uploads</a> last August. The platform warns that choosing to upload at HD quality will consume more bandwidth and storage space.</p><p>A more recent stable update improved the app&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-highlights-calling-experience-updates">video and voice calling</a> experience. WhatsApp rolled out updates such as "Speaker Spotlight" and finally brought audio to the screen-sharing feature. Moreover, older devices received an update, which should help facilitate crystal clear calls no matter how old the device is on Android and iOS.</p>

<h2 id="metal-hellsinger-vr-2">Metal: Hellsinger VR</h2>

<p>Metal: Hellsinger VR is essentially what happens if you take Doom to a heavy metal concert. It&apos;s a new brand of musical wonder as you&apos;ve never experienced before, even if you&apos;ve already played the original Metal: Hellsinger. Shredding has a whole new meaning.</p><p>Pistol Whip might be <em>the</em> definitive action/adventure rhythm game on Quest right now, but Metal: Hellsinger is looking to make a name for itself with this total VR remake of the newly minted classic. Pillage your way through hellish levels with a pulse-pounding metal soundtrack, shooting to the beat and getting bonus points for your music talent.</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6490578927725908">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Battle Talent is getting a massive new multiplayer update, further improving its critically acclaimed roguelike gameplay by adding friends into the mix. There&apos;s no doubt that people will draw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a> similarities to the game now that it supports 4-player multiplayer, but that&apos;s certainly not a bad thing from my standpoint.</p><p>As a roguelike, you&apos;ll join up and fight through and endless number of dungeons, looting along the way until you eventually die. That loot is then taken back to a base where you can upgrade your stats, weapons, and armor, amassing over 100 weapons, 60 perks, and fighting 80 different kinds of enemies.</p><p>Plus, Meta Quest 3 players now have access to a brand-new mixed-reality mode that&apos;ll have goblins jumping off your couch. It&apos;s a ton of fun, and the new update makes it even better!</p><p><strong>Get it at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/8752849024786000/">Meta Horizon Store</a> | <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331510/Battle_Talent/">Steam</a></p>

<p>The Infinite Inside is a spectacle of a mixed reality game that combines two disparate worlds into one fascinating adventure puzzle game. Based on the earlier demo, each level starts in your physical room with a small tower that pops out of the floor. You&apos;ll have to search in and around the tower for puzzle pieces, eventually assembling them to create the key to unlock the tower&apos;s entrance.</p><p>Once that happens, you&apos;ll be transported inside the tower, and that&apos;s where the real fun comes in. While the puzzle portion of the game is certainly fun, exploring the tower <em>from the inside</em> is even more amazing.</p><p>I got my hands on the game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">a few months back</a> and was blown away by how seamless and surreal the transition between my living room and the virtual world is, further enhanced by the fact that you warp <em>into</em> the virtual tower in front of you once you&apos;ve unlocked its entrance. This one&apos;s coming out in just a month, so you won&apos;t have to wait long to experience it!</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6467768793276403">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Did you ever play the classic PC strategy game Dungeon Keeper back in the day? If so, Underworld Overseer is <em>exactly</em> what you&apos;ve been hoping for, as it feels very much like a VR version of Dungeon Keeper. Plus, it&apos;s made by the same folks that brought us the lovable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/deisim-for-oculus-quest-filled-the-void-in-my-heart-that-black-and-white-left">Deisim</a>, a game that evokes the feelings of classic strategy games like Black & White and Civilization.</p><p>The game spans 18 levels, each of which takes around 20-25 minutes apiece to complete. Plus, completing each level unlocks a hard version to play after, giving strategy buffs something to really test their skills.</p><p>I&apos;ve actually been playing an early build of Underworld Overseer for the past month and have been thoroughly impressed with its quality. I&apos;m a huge Dungeon Keeper fan and loved playing the games when I was younger. Being able to pick up creatures with my hands and quickly move them around is a dream come true for micro-managing.</p><p>Plus, the team&apos;s expertise from Deisim shines through, giving this a truly built-for-VR feel instead of just feeling like a classic game ported to a VR interface. And it&apos;s got an incredible visual flair, with the cleanest visuals I&apos;ve <em>ever</em> seen on the Quest 3. I seriously can&apos;t believe how sharp and clean it looks!</p><p>Underworld Overseer launches later this year on October 31.</p>

<p>Smash Drums is already one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> you can buy, and part of that is because of the hard work that the developer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MrPotam">MrPotam</a> puts in. Today&apos;s Freakin Rock Show update features both solo and multiplayer enhancements and is available right now for the Meta Quest platform.</p><p>Solo mode now features significantly enhanced stadiums to play in, including crowds waving and cheering, and lights that are synced with the music. As you might expect, things just get wilder as you do better in the game. Plus, there&apos;s a bunch of new mixed reality improvements to bring those stadium lights to your room. Additional effects have also been added to multiplayer arenas, helping to spruce up your already exciting music-making sessions.</p><p>The Pop Rock Legends DLC is coming July 8th and will feature a bunch of popular punk rock songs for just a few bucks. Smash Drums regularly has updates and new DLC packs, ensuring that there&apos;s always new music to smash to.</p><p><strong>Get it now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/3630025217090808/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Cubism creator Thomas Van Bouwel is back with Laser Dance, a mixed reality game with some serious Mission Impossible vibes. Step into the shoes of a secret agent and make your way through a field of lasers that magically appear in the very room you&apos;re physically standing in. It&apos;s a <em>very</em> different kind of puzzle game from Cubism as it requires not just your hands and mind this time, but your entire body to complete.</p><p><strong>Wishlist now on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7209598115800315/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>While the name might immediately evoke thoughts of a VR Dark Souls game, this one is actually Price of Persia VR. Maybe more specifically, Ember Souls feels like the VR port of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time with its time-warping abilities, epic parkour scenes, and intricate puzzles to solve along the way.</p><p>The combat looks impressive and the trailer notes that players will make their way through beautiful Persian palaces with ornate visuals that push the limits of Meta Quest hardware. Ember Souls debuts this Fall.</p><p><strong>Wishlist on the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7618457878170007/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Few VR games feature the level of polish and believable scripted sequences that you&apos;ll see in Zero Caliber 2. It&apos;s the "Call of Duty VR" you&apos;ve been waiting for, and its immersive dozen-hour-long campaign will have you gritting your teeth the entire time. It&apos;s incredibly intense and will regularly blow your mind with how much is going on.</p><p>While it&apos;s obviously a direct sequel to the original Zero Caliber, you don&apos;t need to have played the first game to have a good time here. Folks who have played the original will understand the story better, of course, but the excellent voice acting and well-written sequences will impress everyone regardless of past experiences.</p><p>I&apos;ve had the chance to play the full game and was beyond impressed with what I got to play. I thought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/tired-of-vr-shooting-games">I was sick of shooters</a> at the beginning of this year but games like Zero Caliber 2 have showed me that there&apos;s plenty of room for high-quality games, even if the experience might seem initially familiar.</p><p><strong>Preorder now at </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6072194326150034/">Meta Horizon Store</a></p>

<p>Everyone loves SUPERHOT VR. It&apos;s the quintessential "must play" game on Quest aside from Beat Saber. If you haven&apos;t played it before, the concept is that time moves when you do. Stay still, plan your attack, and move in for the kill. So what does this have to do with COLD VR? Everything, really.</p><p>COLD VR is, essentially, SUPERHOT VR in reverse. In COLD VR, standing still is a death wish as time moves the moment you stop. Keep moving and you&apos;ll be like Neo from the Matrix, always outwitting and outmaneuvering your opponents before they can act. It&apos;s the spiritual successor to SUPERHOT VR we&apos;ve been asking for!</p><p>COLD VR is coming later this year but you can play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636890/COLD_VR/">a demo on Steam</a> right now.</p>

<ul><li>Snapchat detailed several new tools that teen users can utilize to ensure their safety, such as expanded in-app warnings for unknown users.</li><li>The block button has been upgraded, not only will it keep a user away but it will also reject any friend requests created on that person's device from new accounts.</li><li>Snapchat detailed several new features for its platform, such as an edit button, Bitomoji customization, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Snapchat is highlighting a few new tools that are arriving for its community that might provide a little more peace of mind.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-features-to-help-protect-our-community?lang=en-US">Policy Hub post</a>, Snapchat announced an expansion of safeguard measures to better protect its users from "suspicious" users. Moving forward, teen users should notice an improved version of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://values.snap.com/news/new-safeguards-for-snapchatters-2023?lang=en-US">in-app warnings</a>. Snapchat states such users will be warned about a user with an unsavory past, i.e; they&apos;ve been blocked or reported several times before.</p><p>Additionally, the new in-app warnings will factor in whether or not the person privately messaging a user is from another country. The post adds that such a signal could be indicative of a scam, thus provoking the warning.</p><p>Snapchat details "enhanced friending protections," designed to go hand-in-hand with the upgraded in-app warnings. These new protections should make it more difficult for strangers to use Search and discover teen users through Quick Add. The app is said to block the delivery of a friend request from a user a teen account doesn&apos;t have a mutual friend with.</p>

<p>The block button gains a buff, with the company stating that blocking a user will now "block new friend requests sent from other accounts created on the same device." The intention is to help get a handle on early signs of cyberbullying and other forms of harassment.</p><p>Lastly, Snapchat states it&apos;s increasing the frequency of its location-sharing reminders. This will be joined by the introduction of "simplified location-sharing" through the Snap Map. The feature will provide simpler customization controls to help users quickly enable which friends can view their current location.</p><p>Users will find options to select which friends are excluded from seeing their location or handpicking a specific list of users. Additionally, users can have their location open to everyone they&apos;ve befriended.</p><p>These security and safety updates should begin rolling out in the days ahead.</p><p>Similarly, Meta introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-stricter-messaging-settings-instgram-facebook">an array of protections</a> for supervised teen accounts on Instagram and Facebook earlier this year. Not only must teens submit a request for a settings change, but "Stricter Messaging" rolled in to protect those aged 16 (or 18) from texts from unknown users.</p><p>In other news, Snapchat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-edit-button-teaser-feature-highlights">highlighted a few new features</a> for its platform, such as My AI reminders, avatar reactions in Snap Map, and Bitmoji customization options. The kicker in that previous update was confirmation of an edit button for messages. Snapchat calls them "editable chats," giving users five minutes to return to a text to correct mistakes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/snapchat-plus-launch">Snapchat Plus</a> subscribers will get their hands on this before it flows down to everyone else.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new update for its Chrome app on Android and iOS, bringing with it five new features.</li><li>The update includes new Chrome Actions, making it easier to interact with search results as you type.</li><li>There's also a "refreshed" address bar for Chrome on tablets, as it will now show the current website in the drop-down menu.</li></ul>
<p>Things have been pretty quiet on the Chrome front lately, but as version 126 starts rolling out, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-mobile-features-june-2024/">Google has included</a> five new features. Although none of these features are "ground-breaking," there are a couple of exciting ones.</p><p>Although it&apos;s not the first highlight on Google&apos;s list, the Chrome address bar has been redesigned for the iPad and Android tablets. Along with being tweaked to make better use of the screen real estate, it&apos;s also been refreshed to match the "Material You design language."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:152.80%;"><img id="4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc" name="redesigned-chrome-address-bar-tablets-render.png" alt="Redesigned address bar in Chrome for tablets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4zXg8pVPbRcvaMeZUX5SQc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="1528" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might not be something you notice immediately, there&apos;s another handy trick. When tapping within the address bar, the current webpage that you&apos;re using will appear within the drop-down menu. Handy and useful, for sure, but we&apos;re still keeping our fingers crossed for the ability to move the address bar to the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Chrome Actions is probably a feature that you forget about even exists, but Google hasn&apos;t. Once the update arrives, shortcuts will appear below the search box as you type.

<p>Keeping with the idea of speeding things up, Google is adding a new "shortcut suggestions" feature to Chrome for Android and iOS. If there&apos;s something that you look up on a regular basis, the most pertinent results should now appear at the top of your suggestions.</p><p>The last two features further blur the line between Chrome and the standalone Google app. First, Google is bringing its "live sports cards" to the Discover Feed within the Chrome app. Based on the render provided, it&apos;s practically identical to what&apos;s found in the Discover Feed on your Android devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc" name="sports-card-discover-feed-chrome-render.jpg" alt="Sports Cards appearing within Discover Feed on New Tab Page in Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74wBYUjyuxGKiSRgm2ujWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly is a feature that&apos;s already been available on Android, but is now coming to iOS. Once the update arrives, you&apos;ll now see a list of "Trending Searches" appear when tapping within the address bar "from the New Tab page."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:171.01%;"><img id="6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc" name="search-trends-in-chrome-on-ios.png" alt="Trending Searches in Chrome for iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JGXNfiCuXhdaH27c7KuHc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1352" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can&apos;t help but feel as though Google might be moving away from the Discover Feed, as more features get integrated into the Chrome app. Perhaps that&apos;s in the cards, but, we&apos;re hopeful that isn&apos;t the case, even if it is a bit more convenient for those that practically live within the Chrome app.</p><p>All of these features are rolling out in some capacity starting now. The only exception is with the new Chrome Actions, as it&apos;s coming to Android first, and will be available on the iPhone "later this fall."</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube is testing a new feature that lets users take their favorite shorts with them, but it&apos;s only for Android viewers.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-shorts-smart-downloads-3454371/">Android Authority</a>, YouTube has kickstarted a test it calls "Shorts Smart Downloads." The company&apos;s experimental <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">lab notes</a> state that Premium users can have any recommended Shorts downloaded onto their device automatically.</p><p>YouTube adds users enrolled in the test, who head into their "You" tab and go down to "Smart Downloads." If you&apos;ve watched Shorts recently, the company states that you should see a few previously downloaded videos that you may enjoy.</p><p>This test is only available for YouTube Premium users on Android until July 15. Users must opt into it if they would like to test it.</p><p>The publication notes that YouTube conducted a test run of these Smart Downloads for Shorts back in April, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1cc5yp9/how_to_disable_shorts_from_smart_downloads/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">detailed on Reddit</a>. Speculation suggests this was an early, limited experiment, and with feedback going well, YouTube likely extended it to gain a broader understanding.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.71%;"><img id="4rxAphoQPkFrTxm9YJfuDk" name="youtube-shorts-smart-downloads-premium-test.jpg" alt="YouTube kickstarts a test for "Shorts Smart Downloads."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rxAphoQPkFrTxm9YJfuDk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1083" height="560" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the latest Shorts test, it seems YouTube continues bringing more awareness to its short-form videos after plugging them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-show-you-shorts-in-more-places-on-the-web">into the sidebar</a>. YouTube announced that its short-form content generates over 70 billion views daily. As such, Shorts have made their way into the sidebar on the web and beneath videos on mobile. The carousel is filled with Shorts of a similar theme to the current video you&apos;re watching.</p><p>Another test, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-is-testing-a-new-way-for-fans-to-show-some-love-to-their-favorite-channels">Hype</a>," lets users directly impact the length of their favorite video&apos;s reach across the platform. YouTube focuses on helping smaller creators reach larger audiences by installing Hype votes, letting viewers help adjust their content&apos;s ranking in the Explore tab.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube recently started testing its next phase in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-server-side-injectable-ads-test">war against ad blockers</a> with server-side ads. These advertisements are woven into the video a user would watch, effectively rendering their browser&apos;s ad blocker useless.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is coming up on being three years old, which is ancient in the tech space. However, for entry-level users who don’t need all the bells and whistles of the most premium models, it’s a viable option. But you’d most likely be better off with something newer, even if it costs a bit more.</p></p>

<p>If you’re new to the world of fitness and health tracking via wearables and you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, you might be considering getting an affordable smartwatch first to test the waters before diving into a more premium option. It might also be something for a teen or tween that they can use to keep on top of schedules, chores, and health.</p><p>Two good models to consider are the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 4. The former is the newer of the two, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">released in summer 2024</a> and designed for new users. The latter is an older model but was premium at the time of its launch. Which should you choose? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE might be an entry model, but it’s no slouch in the style department. It’s available in a 40mm size and employs a design based on the other, more premium models in the line with a circular face and two side buttons.</p><p>The 1.2-inch Super AMOLED screen is made of sapphire crystal glass, so it’s durable, and protected against scratches and scuffs. The screen is a full color always on display offering 396 x 396 pixel resolution.</p><p>Available in Black, Pink Gold, or Silver with new watch bands that have blue and orange stitching, you can customize the watch face to make it your own. The band is one-click style so it’s easy to swap out for other colors and styles. The watch meets 5ATM and IP68 ratings for both water and dust resistance, along with MIL-STD-810H standards so you can be confident that it’s well made.</p><p>Like all other Samsung Galaxy smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch FE can seamlessly connect with Samsung Galaxy devices, like smartphones, tablets, and earbuds. Use features like Find My Phone from the watch to locate a misplaced device, remotely control a Samsung smartphone camera, and pay for items on the go with Samsung Wallet. You can also store ID cards, like a driver’s license and student ID from Samsung Wallet as well. You can use it with other Android phones, too, but you won’t get as seamless an experience.</p><p>With Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and built-in GPS, there’s an LTE option if you want to get a separate cellular plan for this watch to remain connected wherever you are, even without your phone (think morning run, in a meeting while your phone is at your desk, or at the gym). It also comes loaded with apps like Google Maps and YouTube Music thanks to WearOS.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is made from armor aluminum and comes in a 40mm or larger 44mm (stainless steel) size, great for those who have larger wrists or want something less dainty. It’s available in Black, Green, and Silver (44mm version) or Black, Pink Gold, and Silver (40mm version) and has the same two side keys for home and back. The interchangeable bands are made of comfortable fluoroelastomer that doesn’t irritate the skin, as we found in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">review of the smartwatch a few years ago</a>.</p><p>Equipped with either a 1.4-inch or 1.2-inch circular Super AMOLED full-color, always-on screen, the smaller version offers 396 x 396 resolution and it’s 450 x 450 for the larger 44mm edition. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass DX+, so it’s durable as well. You can enjoy plenty of custom watch faces with this model as well, and even a full QWERTY keyboard if you’re adventurous enough to attempt composing a message from the tiny screen.</p><p>The larger model has a bigger 316mAh battery but if you opt for the smaller one, it’s the same 247mAh battery as the Galaxy Watch FE. Our reviewer found that it lasted about a day and a half with typical usage. The Galaxy Watch 4 meets the same 5ATM and IP68 rating as well as MIL-STD-810G, a step down from MIL-STD-810H. The latter is the latest revision of the specification which involves some additional testing, but you can rest assured that both smartwatches are pretty durable.</p><p>With the older Bluetooth 5.0 spec, there’s an LTE option for this watch as well. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 also comes with NFC and built-in GPS. But there’s no access to the new Samsung Wallet (though you can presumably use the Samsung Pay).</p><p>As with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a>, you can connect this one seamlessly to your Samsung Galaxy smartphone and other devices within the Galaxy ecosystem. This watch also has Google Assistant built-in, which some users might find handy.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 4: Specs</h2>
<p>When it comes down to the bare bones specs, these two smartwatches are pretty similar in many ways.</p>

<p>When comparing the 40mm size of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 to the same-sized Samsung Galaxy Watch FE, are a lot of similarities between these two devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CdHNrSTxNmyxe2sNirB7v5" name="golfpad-galaxy-watch-4-on-green.jpg" alt="GolfPad on the Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CdHNrSTxNmyxe2sNirB7v5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the question, what can these watches do and how do they operate? </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE runs an Exynos W920 dual core 1.18GHz processor, an older version of what you’ll find in the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> and the same processor from the Galaxy Watch 4 as well as the Galaxy Watch 5. It is powered by WearOS with Samsung’s One UI 5 Watch.</p><p>Despite its affordable price and entry-level target, the Galaxy Watch FE has plenty of sensors. At its heart is Samsung’s advanced BioActive Sensor, which is designed to not only track your activity but also provide personalized and actionable tips to help you improve.</p><p>Like the latest Samsung smartwatches, the focus is on sleep and helping you get the best rest possible. There are advanced sleep features like the ability to monitor sleep patterns, sleep coaching, and assistance in creating a sleep-friendly environment.</p><p>For heart health, there are loads of monitoring features. Along with tracking 24/7 heart rate, the watch can deliver HR Alerts when it detects abnormally high or low heart rates. It also has an Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification (IHRN) feature that monitors heart rhythms and advises if atrial fibrillation (Afib) is suspected. The Watch also measures blood pressure and ECG, adding more data to the holistic picture of your health and wellness.</p><p>For exercise, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE can track more than 100 different workouts and show progress right on your wrist. There’s advanced running analysis for runners, which tracks overall performance to help you maximize efficiency and provide guidance and insights. Runners will also appreciate the ability to use personalized heart rate zones to set their own custom goals based on physical capabilities.</p><p>Additionally, the Watch offers Body Composition tracking, which provides body and fitness data to help you track progress. As a bonus, it even sends motivational messages to guide and encourage you along the way.</p>

<p>As noted, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 runs on the same Exynos W920 dual core 1.18GHz processor, so you won’t get a snappier experience from this watch than you would with the newer Galaxy Watch FE, despite the latter being an entry model while the Watch 4 was a premium model when it launched in August 2021. However, our Galaxy Watch 4 reviewer found that everything ran really well on the smartwatch when he tested it way back when, saying the device did everything asked of it almost instantaneously.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 operates with Wear OS powered by Samsung as well. You can access various Google apps thanks to Wear OS, like Google Maps as well as third-party ones like Spotify and Calm.</p><p>This watch has a Samsung BioActive sensor, too, which can track activities and metrics like heart rate, bioelectrical impedance analysis (though you need to manually input your weight each time to get the data), ECG, and more.</p><p>You won’t get the same deep sleep tracking and insights but our reviewer found that the Galaxy Watch 4 did a pretty good job tracking sleep, including stages, and providing a sleep score. You can also access sleep coaching through the Samsung Health app. Nonetheless, if sleep tracking is important to you, this might be a deciding factor between the two. You do, however, get features like body composition, which leverages the BIA analysis.</p>

<p>If you’re on a tight budget, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE provides an almost identical experience to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 yet it’s about $100 cheaper. That makes it a pretty good value option that will be considered outdated long after the Galaxy Watch 4 reaches that point (it arguably already has).</p><p>With both watches, you get a slower, outdated processor and shorter battery life compared to more premium models, which are arguably two pretty big concessions. Considering that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is just $100 more than both, you might be better off just going with that model, even if you have to wait longer to save up a bit more.</p><p>There isn’t really a compelling reason to go for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 when comparing these two, beyond the larger size option with a slightly higher resolution screen and longer battery life. When comparing apples to apples with the 40mm version of both, the Galaxy Watch FE will provide enough and then some to justify choosing it instead.</p><p>It’s also important to keep in mind that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is likely to launch soon. When it does, you will probably be able to find even better deals on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 models. By that time, the Galaxy Watch 4 will be even farther in the rear-view mirror, making it a less appealing option, even for new users.</p><p>Between these two, if you’re dead set on the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, go with the Galaxy FE. Newer is almost always better, and that watch has similar specs to the Galaxy Watch 4 with other new features you won’t find. It will also future-proof your purchase a little longer until you save up for something better. Then, you can choose from among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">the best Android smartwatches</a> which, coincidentally, includes the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</p>

<p>You’ll get a nearly premium experience with the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE without spending a fortune and be confident that you have the latest and greatest.

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 was a fabulous watch when it launched, and it’s still not far behind the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE in terms of specs. In fact, it’s fairly on par with it. But it’s older, outdated, and not the type of product you want to buy right now. If you’re getting similar features, stick with the latest, especially since it’s offered at the same price.</p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re stuck on a strict budget, there are plenty of cheap Android smartwatches we&apos;d recommend. Which you choose will depend on how you define "cheap," but also whether you need a proper Wear OS watch with Android phone integration or more of a fitness tracker for health data and basic notifications.</p><p>Most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> cost between $300 and $500, so we&apos;ve tried to keep this list in the $200-and-under range as much as possible. The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is a solid budget option for affordable smarts, but we&apos;ll also point you to even cheaper options, or ones focused more on fashion or athletics.</p><p>Depending on where you&apos;re willing to compromise — whether it&apos;s on price, apps, fitness features, or design — you&apos;ll be happy with at least one of the best cheap Android smartwatches available.</p>

<p>Samsung makes our favorite Android watches, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> is too expensive for this list, and our old favorites like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> or Watch 4 are mostly out of stock and sold by shady resellers. Plus, they&apos;ll lose software support from Samsung fairly soon. However, Samsung just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, a slightly redesigned Galaxy Watch 4 due to receive years of software support.</p><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, the Galaxy Watch FE offers heart rate with passive AFib data, blood oxygen, ECG readings, and body composition scans for body fat percentage. It has IP68 dust and water resistance, plus military-grade protection against shock. Plus, it has tap-to-pay and support for both Google Assistant and Bixby.</p><p>What&apos;s different about it? Samsung added fun stitching to the default watch bands for a signature look and a Sapphire Crystal layer to the 1.2-inch display. And this new release resets the clock on software support, so even though it has an older Exynos chip than the latest Galaxy Watch, it should still get Wear OS updates for years. Still, this is essentially a watch with tech from 2021 and 2022, repurposed for 2024. That&apos;s what you have to accept for the discount!</p><p><strong>Cheap alternative:</strong> With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> arriving soon, you may find discounted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review"><strong>Galaxy Watch 6</strong></a> models available for not much higher than the Watch FE. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung Galaxy Watch FE vs. Galaxy Watch 6</a> guide runs through the differences.

<p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> today are on the pricey side. But the TicWatch E3, which originally launched with Wear OS 2 and received Wear OS 3 recently, is the rare option that&apos;s quite affordable, especially since it frequently goes on sale. You&apos;ll simply have to accept some downsides for the low price.</p><p>First, the positives. Most of our other cheap Android smartwatch picks are fitness watches with proprietary OSs and no app support. The TicWatch E3 gives you all the apps you could want, and it has a stronger battery life than the Galaxy Watch FE—especially in Essential mode. </p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-e3-review">TicWatch E3</a> reviewer had a laundry list of positives when describing it. He noted "little to no delay in opening apps or loading up the Play Store on the watch," something you can&apos;t say for many fitness watches. And on that note, it has heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring for workout and sleep tracking, with the results on par with those he measured on Samsung and Amazfit watches. </p><p>In exchange for the low price, you&apos;re getting an LCD with a thick bezel that our reviewer called "a bit excessive." You also have to rely on the touchscreen, which may bother you if you&apos;re used to a digital crown. The TicWatch E3 has less RAM and storage than the Galaxy Watch FE, as well. But since we&apos;ve seen it discounted for half the price of Samsung&apos;s cheapest watch, these are fair compromises.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> We&apos;ve also seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-3-gps-review"><strong>TicWatch Pro 3</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ticwatch-pro-3-ultra-gps-review"><strong>TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra</strong></a> discounted into the $150 range. They have the same software and performance, but far stronger battery life, AMOLED displays, and better materials. We just can&apos;t guarantee they&apos;ll be as cheap as the E3 at any given moment.</p>

<p>When it comes to cheap Android smartwatches, Amazfit is one of the first brands we think of. It sells a dozen or more watches at any time, most of which cost $230 or less. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">best Amazfit smartwatch</a> guide runs through several great options, but we&apos;re highlighting our top pick here: the Amazfit GTS 4.</p><p>Like our previous pick for this spot—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-gts-3-review">Amazfit GTS 3</a>—the GTS 4 has all of the essentials, from continuous heart, blood oxygen, stress, and breathing data to hundreds of sports modes (with 8 auto-recognized activities like running or cycling). They both have Alexa commands and simple apps like weather and alarms. You also get a gorgeous 1.75-inch AMOLED display with 1,000 nits of brightness and 341 pixels per inch.</p><p>With the GTS 4, Amazfit added a speaker so you can make Bluetooth calls and hear Alexa&apos;s responses instead of reading them. It also added dual-band GPS for more accurate tracking results. Unfortunately, it still lacks NFC for contactless payments, and the revamped "BioTracker 4.0" cuts the battery life down compared to the GTS 3. But it&apos;s still just as long-lived as most other fitness watches, and longer than a Wear OS watch.</p><p>We appreciate how Amazfit takes your workout data and judges your fitness level, training load, and other data via its PeakBeats algorithm. You don&apos;t get the Zepp Coach AI of some of the newer watches, but it&apos;ll still help guide you to get fitter, without the subscription that our next pick charges.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> As we said, Amazfit has plenty of cheaper options that cut specific features like the mic and speaker. Look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review"><strong>Amazfit GTR Mini</strong></a> for a more circular design, or the <strong>Amazfit Active</strong> for a cheaper squircle.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> is a bit of an odd fitness watch. After Google acquired Fitbit, it made the company change some of its design and hardware strategy, and that played out in the Versa 4. Our reviewer wasn&apos;t a big fan of its cutbacks, but it still gives you Fitbit&apos;s respected health and fitness insights for $100 less than the Sense 2, making it a lock for this list.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-versa-3-review">Fitbit Versa 3</a>, the Versa 4 lost the old Fitbit OS&apos; third-party apps, replaced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-google-maps-fitbit-sense-2-versa-4">Google Maps</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-google-wallet-fitbit-sense-2-versa-4">Google Wallet</a>—arguably more useful. More frustratingly, it no longer supports Google Assistant, nor music storage or playback controls like the Versa 3 did. That makes it less of a "smart" watch than its predecessor. You still have Alexa commands, but the Wi-Fi antenna is disabled, making responses slower than they should be.</p><p>Still, you get a 6-day watch with a gorgeously bright AMOLED display, built-in GPS with an altimeter for judging elevation, Bluetooth calling, continuous heart rate, blood oxygen, heart rate variance (HRV), and breathing rate. It&apos;s enough for Fitbit to give you a ton of insights into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a> and your overall wellness, so long as you keep subscribing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> after the free 6-month trial ends.</p><p><em><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong></em> We&apos;ve seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review"><strong>Fitbit Sense 2</strong></a> dip to $199 during various deal events in the past couple of years; if you spot it at that price, you can upgrade to get an ECG and stress sensors, among other perks. You may also want the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review"><strong>Fitbit Charge 6</strong></a>; you lose the pretty squircle display and altimeter but gain YouTube Music controls, the ECG, an upgraded HR sensor for accuracy, and a lighter fit.</p>

<p>Most cheap Android smartwatches have cheap, toy-like appearances, whether you choose a squircle or circular display. That&apos;s why many gravitate towards <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-hybrid-smartwatches">hybrid smartwatches</a> that pick style over substance. But since most of our favorite hybrids are expensive, we&apos;re picking the reasonable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-vivomove-sport-review">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a> for this spot.</p><p>Shipping in Ivory, Cocoa, Cool Mint, or Black, the Vivomove Sport looks like a traditional watch, with actual watch hands and a subtle monocolor OLED touchscreen on the bottom half of the watch. It&apos;s designed to passively track your heart rate, stress, blood oxygen, Body Battery, and other data for you to check in the Garmin Connect app.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a>, the Vivomove Sport is pretty limited. You won&apos;t find Garmin Pay, built-in GPS, or robust training tools like Garmin Coach. This is much more of a subtle tool for basic stats like Intensity Minutes, steps, calories burned, and sleep insights. But we think plenty of people will prefer a simplified, stylish experience.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> Most Garmin watches cost $400 and up, with a few hitting $1,000! So even though they&apos;re too expensive for this list, the $250 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 165</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2</strong></a> are <em>relatively</em> cheap for the brand. The Forerunner is a fantastic training tool for runners with workout suggestions and post-run recovery time; the Venu gives you the squircle look and a solid 11-day battery life.</p>

<p>As we mentioned with the GTS 4, Amazfit makes a variety of cheap Android smartwatches. The Amazfit T-Rex 2 is basically the opposite of the GTS 4, which is much daintier and focused on a traditional smartwatch experience. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-2-review">T-Rex 2 reviewer</a> said that this watch "will likely outsurvive you" thanks to its rugged durability, and that&apos;s a nice reassurance when most cheap watches aren&apos;t built to last long.</p><p>The T-Rex 2 weighs a hefty 66.5g, making it noticeable on your wrist compared to most of the thin, shorter-lived entries on this list—but significantly lighter than the stainless steel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">T-Rex Ultra</a>. It survived over a dozen MIL-STD-810G certifications and has a 10ATM water resistance rating, twice as deep as most smartwatches can handle. Plus, it can last for weeks per charge under normal conditions.</p><p>Otherwise, this watch and the GTS 4 aren&apos;t that different. You get a ridiculous number of sports modes and eight automatic exercises, plus data on your heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, and breathing. It even has the Zepp Coach AI, though not the GTS 4&apos;s mic/speaker combo or its newer HR sensor LEDs that are supposed to be 33% more accurate.</p><p><strong>Cheap alternatives:</strong> We&apos;ve already brought up other cheap Amazfit watches to consider, and other rugged watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2</a> are too expensive for this list. We also like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-pro-review">T-Rex Pro</a>, though it has an even older health sensor suite, a smaller display, and other downsides. If you don&apos;t need ruggedness and just want a cheap fitness watch, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-review">Polar Pacer</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">Coros Pace 3</a>.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-between-the-best-cheap-android-smartwatches-2">Choosing between the best cheap Android smartwatches</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this list will make it clear that you can find a cheap Android smartwatch that doesn&apos;t feel like a complete downgrade. Most of them have a baseline of features that you&apos;ll want: health and sleep tracking, notifications, and solid battery life. But in other ways, you&apos;ll have to accept compromises.</p><p>Your first big decision is whether to choose Wear OS or a secondary option like Fitbit or Garmin OS. We appreciate the Galaxy Watch FE and TicWatch series for giving you access to Play Store apps and the ability to respond to notifications on your wrist. But in exchange, you&apos;ll have to charge them every one to two days, while other picks on this list will last a week or more.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> are smarter than others, and most of our picks sacrificed features that you may really want. You&apos;ll want the Versa 4 for Bluetooth calling, but not for music playback. Amazfit watches don&apos;t have tap-to-pay. Hybrid watches typically don&apos;t have built-in GPS. Make sure to do your research before you buy, so you don&apos;t end up regretting your choice.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE looks smart and superior next to our other picks, but do remember that it&apos;s a downgrade compared to other full-priced smartwatches. Specifically, it has less RAM, an older CPU, and a thicker border around its display than the Galaxy Watch 6. You may want to hunt for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/prime-day-smartwatch-deals-2024">Prime Day smartwatch deals</a> instead of compromising.</p>
