                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Users on Reddit reported new read receipt indicators for RCS chats in Google Messages and an APK teardown provided more insight.</li><li>Per the teardown, Google is testing a change in Messages that moves those sent/delivered indicators inside the bubble with your text.</li><li>A Reddit user discovered that you'd have to press and hold a message and drag it to view the time it was sent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly developing a redesign for its RCS text indicators in Messages.</p><p>The company is developing a (type of) "in-line" read receipt notification for its RCS-enabled chats. Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/google_messages_read_receipt_ui_changed_for_me/">Reddit have reported</a> these new indicators on their devices while in the Google Messages beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-read-receipt-rollout-3496172/">Android Authority</a>). More importantly, the publication conducted an APK dive of the recent beta version (messages.android_20241029_00_RC00)</p><p>From screenshots shared on Reddit to the publication's teardown, these new indicators will occupy the right-most corner of your text bubble.</p><p>Further digging shows that the animations have changed, too. According to the post, sending a message is accompanied by an ellipsis (three dots) before turning into a single check mark. A second check mark — or part of it — appears against the first, showing that the message has been sent and delivered successfully.</p><p>These new receipt indicators are (potentially) always present in the text thread no matter the number of messages. This contrasts how Messages is currently where the most recently sent text displays its RCS sent/delivered indicators. Additionally, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/comment/lut1874/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user on Reddit</a> in the beta states Google changed how you can see the time of a text.</p><p>The user states users must "hold and pull the screen to see the time the message came/sent." After, the app will automatically drop the text to cover those extra details.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1ggwf3f/google_messages_read_receipt_ui_changed_for_me">Google messages Read receipt u.i changed for me.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As the test expands to more users, it's unclear when Google will roll this out. Reports of these revamped indicators were posted recently, so the company will likely wait a while for feedback/testing before pushing it to everyone.</p><p>It's worth remembering that Google Messages used to (digitally) say "Sending..." and "Sent" when texting others. That changed last year when the company introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-new-read-receipts">the new checkmarks</a> we've become accustomed to seeing in the app. With this change looming, Google moves them from beneath your message, beside the time, to inside the bubble with your text.</p><p>Aside from your texts, it was reported recently that Google Messages could receive extra privacy options through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-adding-profile-discovery-privacy-feature">Profile Discovery</a>. Such options include showing your name and profile icon to "people you message," "only contacts," or "no one." These additions were discovered on the setup screen for the Messages app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is alerting all interested Pixel testers about its next QPR test for Android 15.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ggq2he/android_15_qpr2_beta_around_the_corner/">took to Reddit</a> to announce the upcoming start of the Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1. Google states this next beta will "build on top of" the Android 15 QPR1 release, which is expected to hit devices in December. If you are an enrolled Pixel tester through Google's program, the company detailed steps for those willing to stay or those looking to exit.</p><p>Google states any enrolled tester who'd rather receive the stable QPR1 feature drop must "opt out of the program." To avoid a complete data wipe on your Pixel, the post recommends that users follow the remaining steps:</p>
<ul><li>Ignore/don’t apply the downgrade OTA update.The OTA message will have ‘Downgrade’ in the description. Opting out will not cause a data wipe as long as you <strong>don’t</strong> apply the downgrade OTA update. </li><li>If your device is offered the Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 update, <strong>don’t</strong> install the update. Instead, first <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>opt out of the program</u></a>, ignore/don’t apply the downgrade OTA update.</li><li>Wait for the final public stable release of Android 15 QPR1 (AP4A), which is coming in December.</li></ul>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ggq2he/android_15_qpr2_beta_around_the_corner">Android 15 QPR2 Beta around the corner!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>For those looking to stay, Google states the Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1 will be automatically downloaded (likely as an OTA update) once it arrives. The post adds that this next QPR build is intended to be the March 2025 feature drop. Additionally, Google estimates that Android 15 QPR2 will conclude sometime during Q1 2025.</p><p>Aside from "kicking off soon," Google did not give a specific date for the start of QPR2 Beta 1. However, with QPR1 confirmed to roll out in December, perhaps we're looking at a launch in January for the next one, but we'll have to wait and see for an official post.</p><p>The company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-bluetooth-foldable-update">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3</a> last week, and that patch was full of fixes for system crashes. It arrived a little later than what testers (us included) expected. Regardless, the update also provided a blank screen fix for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google's foldable phones</a> that occurred when users unfolded the device.</p><p>More importantly, Google's confirmed timeline for QPR2 Beta 1 might signal the end of Android 15's beta cycle. The company dropped a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">Android SDK</a> update yesterday (Oct 31) and with it came confirmation of Android 16 in Q2 2025. Considering Q1 runs from January to March, Android 15's testing might not go further than that. A Q2 launch for Android 16 gives us April through June to play with as we might see a beta or two before its launch.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-expanding-its-brick-and-mortar-repair-network-across-the-us">a new partnership with Assurant</a> that will bring 300 new places to have your Galaxy product repaired. That's good news, and any move toward more and better customer service after the sale is great to see. But Samsung can do so much better.</p><p>Nine months of every year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-market-share-europe-jumped-over-40-q2-2019">Samsung is the largest electronics retailer in the world</a>; second-place Apple can only best its numbers the month after a new iPhone is announced. Samsung is the world's biggest consumer electronics manufacturer. There is no reason it shouldn't offer the best customer service, too.</p>

<p>There is an easy-to-follow formula here; if you guessed the Apple Store, you're right. You might not want to read this, but Samsung could build just a few models of Galaxy phones and sell support contracts that include friendly, helpful people employed by the company in a Galaxy store who are trained to fix any issue. If you have trouble with your Galaxy phone, watch, tablet, laptop, or earbuds, bring them to the nearest one and get them fixed or replaced while waiting. This works in the West, and we know it works because we can see it.</p><p>Samsung could continue to offer its full portfolio of products without the Galaxy branding for people who aren't looking to spend $1,000 or more instead of considering a new "luxury" brand name like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-reportedly-considers-new-phone-brand-separate-from-galaxy" target="_blank">it is rumored to be doing</a>. This would let the Galaxy name mean more, not less.</p>

<p>Many people think Samsung builds some of the finest consumer electronics available. I'm one of them. The materials, build quality, fit and finish, and overall package of a Samsung phone or tablet are second to none. The company is taking the time and resources to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">improve its software offerings</a> and has turned itself around from being a laughing stock just a few years ago to building something people love. The next logical move is to treat its customers to the same A+ level of support, and one way to do that is by opening more physical stores customers could just walk into when they need help.</p><p>Samsung has some flagship stores in a few cities in the United States, but my guess is that many of you probably haven't seen a Samsung store or would know where to find one.</p><p>I think it would be a good move and a lucrative one at that. I'll be blunt — "poor" people don't buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S Ultras</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Folds</a>. Poor people aren't buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> phones, either. You don't have to be rich to afford Samsung's latest and greatest, but you are going to have a certain level of disposable income. If you're reading this, you probably fall into this category.</p><p>With so much invested into a product, paying $10 a month or $100 a year for top-tier support isn't a bad idea. People are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsung-care">paying it now</a>, only to be left to deal with over-the-phone support or third-party stores where walking out with a solution an hour later isn't a guarantee. If this idea didn't make money, Apple wouldn't be doing it. Apple doesn't operate any area of its business at a loss.</p>
<p>You may not be willing to pay for this "privilege," but I'll bet plenty of people would. A Galaxy Store in all the places where you would find an Apple store would make perfect sense, and not just big flagship stores in a few big cities across the country. Even smaller stores in malls where there's a good amount of traffic would make sense, and Samsung could even put them right across from Apple stores just to piss them off.</p><p>I'm not trying to claim Samsung could ever have the ... rabid ... fandom that Apple has, where people would line up around the block to buy the new Galaxy phone. I'm saying that isn't what keeps an Apple Store profitable; product sales and paid customer service throughout the year are where the money is. Samsung can try to get its share of that money while offering us the level of customer support we deserve when we pay for it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors are floating around that we're (finally) approaching the start of Samsung's Android 15 beta.</p><p>Well-known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1852158438484382194">Ice Universe</a> claims that Samsung is preparing to launch its One UI 7 (Android 15) beta later in November (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/01/samsung-galaxy-android-15-beta-november/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster's post reads, "it will take another half month before Beta starts." As others on X have started to guess, that <em>could </em>put us around mid-November (fingers crossed).</p><p>While this might seem too good to be true, another tipster spotted more evidence.</p><p>Another tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1852000525635539307">Tarun Vats</a>, discovered Samsung's official One UI 7 beta forum pages have started appearing. Samsung has placed forum pages for the Galaxy S24 and S23 series under its "One UI Beta Program" tag. Users chimed in, asking questions about specifics such as the timing for each Galaxy model. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1852002041792430157">Vats states</a> they "don't think" the One UI 7 beta will begin simultaneously for the S24 and the S23.</p><p>It's unclear how much of an increased delay the past-gen series could see if this proves true. Additionally, Vats states these forum pages have appeared on Samsung's U.S. community forums, furthering suspicions behind an upcoming Public Beta start for One UI 7.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking News 💥One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy S24/S23 series is confirmed, as the Beta forum page has been created for it.Repost 🔁#OneUI7 #GalaxyS24 #GalaxyS23 #Samsung pic.twitter.com/0RFTHRS9Yn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1852000525635539307">October 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With Samsung's forum pages reportedly created for the S24 and S23 series, the company might hit that "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-plans-one-ui-7-public-beta">later this year</a>" estimation for the beta. Samsung's Sally Hyesoon Jeong appeared at SDC 2024 where they stated users could "preview" the software in an upcoming beta. While a test period for developers was confirmed, regular users will have a chance once a "schedule is confirmed" by Samsung.</p><p>Seeing how the rumors have progressed, perhaps there's hope that a confirmed schedule will be shared soon.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 7 experienced a more substantial delay than we expected. While the update isn't expected until next year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">with the Galaxy S25 series</a>, the company demoed the software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">during SDC 2024</a>. The major OS upgrade was shown off on a Galaxy S24 Ultra, shedding light on a change: the separation of its notification and Quick Settings panels. It seems users may have to swipe on the left or right side of their device to access either panel.</p><p>That demo also clued us into the Apple-like vibes Samsung is pushing for with One UI 7 and its UI changes. However, 9to5 highlights Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sdc-korea.com/">SDC event in Korea</a> on November 21. There's a chance that we'll either hear more about One UI 7 there or, perhaps, that'll kick off its beta.</p><p>More recently, a massive One UI 7 leak surfaced, showing Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">parental and AI-focused features</a>. It seems parents will have more built-in ways of protecting their children from harmful online content on their Galaxy devices. Samsung isn't letting go of AI advancements as the leak showed One UI 7 may incorporate Circle to Search and tools to enhance photography.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung released its quarterly earnings reports this week, and its device experience division reported $2.45 billion in profits.</li><li>The company is projecting “limited growth” for the final quarter of 2024, and is otherwise looking ahead to 2025.</li><li>In releases and earnings calls, Samsung teased multiple future projects, including the Galaxy S25 series, an XR device, and a cheaper folding phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It’s earnings week, and we’ve already learned a lot about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q3-2024-earnings">Google</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Meta</a> from their financial results. Now, it’s Samsung’s turn, and the South Korean tech giant is spilling the beans on its future plans. Aside from telling us how it performed last quarter, it’s also providing a few semi-cryptic details about its 2025 plans.</p><p>Samsung is a very large company, and some of its greatest successes last quarter actually came from the emergence of HBM DDR5 SSDs and system-on-a-chip (SoC) sales. Narrowing things down a bit, the company’s “Device eXperience” division, which includes phones and mobile devices, recorded an operating profit of roughly $2.45 billion (3.37 trillion South Korean won). It’s projecting “limited growth” for the final quarter of 2024 but has a few ideas about what revenue drivers 2025 might hold.</p><p>Namely, Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%EC%82%BC%EC%84%B1%EC%A0%84%EC%9E%90-2024%EB%85%84-3%EB%B6%84%EA%B8%B0-%EC%8B%A4%EC%A0%81-%EB%B0%9C%ED%91%9C" target="_blank">earnings report</a> included the first official confirmation of the Galaxy S25 series, which will launch next year.</p><p>“Based on the advancement of Galaxy AI, MX plans to promote flagship-oriented sales growth and profitability improvement such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> and foldable, while also expanding sales of ecosystem products such as Galaxy Tab, Book and Wearable,” the report stated, translated to English.</p><p>“The Galaxy S25 series, which will be released in the first half of next year, plans to lead daily innovation by increasing the experience perfection of Galaxy AI and expand sales by strengthening marketing and experience programs.”</p><p>More importantly, Samsung acknowledged its long-planned extended reality headset, which was initially slated for a 2024 release. Now, it’s looking like Samsung’s offering won’t debut until next year.</p><p>”Through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> released this year, we plan to contribute to the expansion of the Samsung Health ecosystem and strengthen the connection experience between our products such as XR (eXtended Reality) devices scheduled to be released in the future,” the release explains.</p>

<p>Samsung continues to view foldables as a growth vector for innovation, and it may be changing its tune on whether a cheaper foldable can (or should) exist. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1851808909050482694" target="_blank">Jukanlosreve on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Samsung’s comments on an earnings call seem to suggest it is warming to the idea of a budget option.</p><p>”We are considering ways to lower entry barriers so that more customers can actually experience foldable products, given the high satisfaction among existing foldable users,” the company said.</p><p>This comes less than a week after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-says-it-has-no-plans-to-make-a-cheaper-foldable-but-why">Samsung said it had “no plans” for a cheaper foldable</a>. We’ll have to wait and see what comes of this, but it’s clear that Samsung sees the Galaxy S25 series, an XR device, and foldables as three key parts of its 2025 growth strategy.</p>

<p>After Apple recently announced its latest M4-powered series of MacBook Pro's, the company made another change that was unexpected. Every current MacBook in Apple's lineup now ships with 16GB of RAM as a base, an upgrade from the previous minimum of 8GB.</p><p>Originally, I was going to compare the MacBook Air to the current crop of Chromebooks until I realized that you can't get a new MacBook for less than $1,100. Meanwhile, the most expensive Chromebook is the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, which is $400 cheaper. Yes, I know there are still a few HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebooks floating around, but those aren't as widely available and are clearly being phased out.</p><p>After some prodding in a meeting, I turned my attention to a comparison that <em>does</em> make sense: Chromebook vs. iPad.</p>

<p>Currently, there are six different iPad models to choose from, starting with the iPad (10th generation) for $349 and going all the way up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-oled-m4-2024">M4 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> for $1,299. Meanwhile, the cheapest Chromebook that's been released in 2024 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-fortis-chromebooks-2024-announcement">HP Chromebook 14-inch</a>, which retails for $249.</p><p>From there, we have a variety of options at different price points, and while the majority of them are laptops, there are a couple of tablets thrown into the mix. These include the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-chromebooks-arrive-in-all-shapes-and-sizes-starting-today">ASUS Chromebook CM30</a>, and more recently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M3dUF5rkP2jHjSAKQa3jRj" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-1.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 propped vertically" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3dUF5rkP2jHjSAKQa3jRj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both of these are tablets, ASUS and Lenovo include a keyboard case in the box. In doing so, it removes any potential stress and additional cost for those who want a true 2-in-1 device. On the other hand, no matter what iPad you're considering, the only other thing that comes in the box is a charging cable.</p><p>Making matters worse for the iPad is that if you want to go with first-party accessories, Apple's Magic Keyboard Folio is priced at $249. Plus, if you want a stylus, tack on another $79, bringing the grand total to about $680.</p><p>That immediately puts the "cheapest" iPad in the same price bracket as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and Chromebook Plus Spin 714. It is also almost $300 more expensive than the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11.</p><p>And we haven't even talked about the hardware or specs.</p>

<p>So, what are you getting with the base model iPad for $349? It's powered by the A14 Bionic SoC, which debuted with the iPhone 12 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review">iPad Air in 2020</a>. This is paired with 4GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, and if you want to use it anywhere, there are Cellular options available.</p><p>I'm not going to sugarcoat anything here, but there's a good reason why Apple is able to "get away" with using a four-year-old processor without facing much backlash. Since Apple controls the entire "stack," it's able to better optimize the software and hardware, when it relies on older processors. This is also why Apple was able to maintain its position as a leader in the industry when it comes to providing software updates for longer than the competition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JhSg5h3YR8hLjLQkWruzgb" name="MediaTek-Kampino-520-528-hero.jpg" alt="The new MediaTek Kompanio chips for Chromebooks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhSg5h3YR8hLjLQkWruzgb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Chromebooks, the aforementioned ASUS Chromebook CM30 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/mediatek-kompanio-520-528-launch">MediaTek Kompanio 520</a>. It also sports 4GB of RAM and 64GB of non-upgradeable storage. But as I mentioned before, ASUS includes the detachable keyboard folio case in the box, which is already a huge benefit, even if you don't plan to use it all that much.</p><p>Performance is where things take a sharp turn. On Geekbench, the Kompanio 520 offers a single-core score of 510 and a multi-core score of 1532. Despite being four years old, the A12 Bionic achieved scores of 1590 and 4247, respectively. Let me put it this way: the cheapest iPad is closer to the Intel-powered Galaxy Chromebook Plus in terms of performance.</p><p>It's not even close; the iPad wins by a landslide here.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AxXbRAekQDdfvQnXsV5Trj" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AxXbRAekQDdfvQnXsV5Trj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is the key to everything, and this is where a sub-$300 Chromebook outshines even a $1300 iPad. With a Chromebook, you not only have access to the ever-growing world of web apps and extensions, but the Play Store is also just a click away. Not to mention that there's an even bigger repository of apps at your disposal if you feel comfortable enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-install-and-run-linux-apps-on-a-chromebook">enable Linux support</a>.</p><p>On an iPad, everything is powered by either the App Store or Safari, and there is just a little bit of wiggle room for anything else. While you can use Chrome or Firefox on an iPad, you won't find any extension support, and for whatever reason, web apps don't always feel as fluid as they do on a Chromebook.</p><p>While important, I'd argue that usability is even more important, especially when it comes to things like using more than one app at a time. The iPad is superb if you're trying to stay focused on one app, but it immediately begins to fall short when you want to toss another app into the mix.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WEEobcWZ3WxmYUfg8ruqjn" name="ipad-pro-2021-stage-manager-ipados-16-1.jpg" alt="Stage Manager on iPad Pro - 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEEobcWZ3WxmYUfg8ruqjn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"But what about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">Stage Manager</a>?" You might be asking, and I'm glad you did. When enabled, it lets you use up to four different apps at the same time. Allowing you to resize and move them around with relative ease. There's even a slide-out "dock" of sorts, letting you basically work within different spaces that are comprised of different apps.</p><p>Technically another app can be used, provided that you can remember that the Slide Over is at your disposal or even how to use it. But it's cumbersome at best, and downright useless more often than not.</p><p>None of that is a problem with a Chromebook, as it works just like any other desktop operating system. The only difference comes when using either a ChromeOS tablet or a Chromebook with a convertible form factor. When doing so, it's more similar to using any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> or iPad, with your app windows locked to a few different layouts.</p><p>However, I'd still argue that Google's implementation is still a bit better. Instead of trying to guess where to put app windows, you can just swipe down from the top of the screen and pick from a few different layouts. These include being able to put an app off to the side and slide it back into view.</p>

<p>This might just sound like a puff piece for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, and to a certain extent, it kind of is. But it's just because I feel as though we're finally moving away from the days of seeing a million different cheap Chromebooks that are underpowered or just bad. In years past, I would have likely recommended an iPad to just about anyone who asked, regardless of how they planned to use it.</p><p>However, the landscape has shifted quite dramatically for Chromebooks. For one, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/ask-jerry-choosing-the-right-chromebook">Chromebook Plus</a>, you know exactly what the minimum specs are, so there's no need to worry about compromising. Regardless of whether you want a tablet or a laptop, you have options to choose from, both of which are going to be either in-line or less expensive than what you would spend on an iPad.</p>

The same is true for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> as well, which is overall a rather modest update over its predecessor. However, the latest version of Google&apos;s popular mobile OS does pack in several new features that are designed to improve your everyday user experience, with &apos;Private Space&apos; being one such addition.</p><p>Essentially a digital vault, Private Space lets you conveniently lock sensitive apps (and by extension, the data accessible through them) in a separate sandbox. You can also set up a second instance of any app in Private Space, which can be then secured with a locking mechanism (e.g., fingerprint, PIN) that&apos;s different from your Pixel&apos;s phone&apos;s main screen lock. Sounds like something you can benefit from? Here&apos;s how to create Private Space for your apps on Pixel, and give the confidential information on your phone an additional layer of protection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-private-space-for-apps-on-your-pixel-2">How to create Private Space for apps on your Pixel</h2>
<p>In addition to the obvious requirement of Android 15, Private Space needs a device having more than 6GB of RAM. Thankfully, the majority of Google&apos;s recent smartphones — including all members of the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> series — fulfill these conditions. Also, this feature doesn&apos;t work on managed devices that are usually issued by organizations to their employees. With that said, here&apos;s how to get started with Private Space.</p>
<p>1. Go to your smartphone&apos;s <strong>Settings</strong> app, scroll down and and tap the <strong>Security & privacy</strong> option.</p><p>2. Now, tap the <strong>Private space</strong> option under the <strong>Privacy</strong> subsection.</p>

<p>3. Once you&apos;ve authenticated yourself with your device&apos;s screen lock, you&apos;ll see the Private Space main screen. It highlights how the feature works, as well as a couple of important things about it. Scroll down to read everything, and tap the <strong>Set up</strong> button.</p>

<p>4. Your Private Space will now be created. When it&apos;s done, you can choose to sign in with an existing or new Google account to the Private Space. However, this step is optional, and can be bypassed by tapping the <strong>Skip</strong> option.</p>

<p>Google Pixels are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> available in the market, and one of the major reasons for that is the top-tier software experience that they come with. When you buy a Pixel smartphone, you&apos;re the first in line to get the newest software release(s), which often include many Pixel-exclusive goodies.</p><p>One such feature is Private Space, which ensures that you—and only you—can see and interact with the confidential apps on your smartphone. Apart from the regular screen lock, Private Space provides your data with an additional layer of protection. It&apos;s extremely easy to set up, lets you run a second instance of any app, and can even be hidden away from view. It&apos;s just one of the many gems you can find in Android 15, which is best experienced on a top-of-the-line device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a>, which offers a gorgeous design, class-leading cameras, superb everyday performance, and more.</p>

<ul><li>A report reveals that Samsung is eyeing a Galaxy S25 Slim, expected to launch a few months after the main series.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is set to debut in January or February 2025, with the S25 Slim possibly following in April.</li><li>The S25 Slim is likely to have a limited launch, similar to the Galaxy Z Fold SE, allowing Samsung to gauge market interest and adjust future models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With rumors swirling about Apple’s plans for a slimmer iPhone, Samsung is also eyeing a thinner model of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineup.</p><p>According to a recent report from South Korea’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241031000259" target="_blank">ET News</a>, Samsung is looking into launching a Galaxy S25 Slim—a thinner version of the S25 series—set to make its debut a few months after the main models (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/31/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-report-iphone/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This speculation comes on the heels of buzz around an iPhone 17 "Air" and Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">unexpected Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition launch in South Korea</a>—a refined, slimmer take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It debuted a few days ago, only a few months after the original model.</p><p>Apple’s rumored slimmer iPhone 17 is supposed to sport a 6.6-inch screen and a single rear camera, but it’s unclear what trade-offs Samsung might make for its Galaxy S25 Slim. With the current slimmest S24 at 7.6mm, the S25 Slim could be set to get even thinner.</p><p>Samsung is likely to unveil the Galaxy S25 series in January or February of next year, with the Galaxy S25 Slim possibly arriving by April, as per tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1851884968919863735" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>. Rumor has it this slim edition is a bit of a test run to see how fans respond—and if it takes off, we might just see a Galaxy S26 Slim in the following year.</p><p>With this strategy in mind, the Galaxy S25 Slim will likely launch on a limited scale, similar to the local release of the Galaxy Z Fold SE. Sources gave the following statement to ET News (machine translated): "It is possible that it will release it in small quantities to gauge market response and change the lineup the year after next."</p><p>In recent years, Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle to create the sleekest smartphones. Samsung has been showcasing the Z Fold 6 as one of its thinnest models.</p><p>Meanwhile, there’s chatter about Apple potentially launching an ultra-slim iPhone 17 in 2026, which could take the place of the Plus series. To achieve that sleek look, Apple might opt for a more streamlined camera setup, likely featuring just a single wide-angle lens.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether Samsung will take a page from Apple’s book by prioritizing a slim design over all-around specs, or if it will aim for a more feature-loaded experience with its upcoming thin device.</p>

Shokz has long been one of the market leaders in the latter, but there are compromises with bone conduction headphones that Shokz has been working to overcome with their speaker technology, specifically TurboPitch.</p><p>The problem with the transducers Shokz used in the previous generation of OpenRun Pro was that they sat on your jaw and had very energetic vibrations, making TurboPitch a polarizing feature over pure bone conduction earbuds/headphones.</p><p>With the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz introduced their DualPitch technology, which builds on the lessons learned with previous generation Shokz bone conduction products. I have to say, lesson learned! Let's get into that.</p>

Shokz also recently released<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"> </a>a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro2" target="_blank"><u> white collaboration with world-renowned Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge </u></a>, with glossy gradient orange and gold accents and trim.</p><p>When it comes to the TurboPitch technology and some of the things that come with it, I’m happy to report that this year’s OpenRun series has greatly improved in that area with the introduction of DualPitch technology. This adds new non-bone conduction speakers and compliments the bone conduction transducers by making the sound richer without excess vibrations on your face.</p><p>There is minimal perceptible vibration from the DualPitch air conduction driver units in the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2. Bass-heavy tracks with the volume cranked up occasionally give you some light vibration, but not to the extent of previous generation Shokz products with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/shokz-openrun-pro-review">TurboPitch technology</a>.</p><p>So, what is DualPitch, anyway? The simplest explanation is that bone conduction technology passes vibrations through your bones so that your auditory structures can pick them up, and you experience "sound." The problem with this conduction method is that almost no bass frequency is passed to you. To solve that problem, Shokz places a separate conventional driver unit inside the earbuds to add those low frequencies back into the mix. That additional unit is their "DualPitch."</p>

<p>So, that’s a little bit of background, but how do they sound? Really good! Bass heads won’t love the flatter sound signature, but products like these serve a very specific purpose, which I think makes up for that. I listened through multiple playlists while walking or running intervals on peaceful residential neighborhood backstreets and busy urban avenues.</p><p>The soundstage when listening to “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” isn’t expansive, but Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s a capella and Paul Simon’s vocals sound really good. Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” shows just how solid the sound separation produced by the OpenRun Pro 2 is. The reproduction of instrumentation staged at various locations in the sound field is really good, considering some of the limitations of the technology, which DualPitch augments.</p><p>Listening to Skrillex’s “Mumbai Place,” you can hear how this setup handles bass and sub-bass. The bass is light but present, and the sub-bass gets compromised, but the vibrations present in previous generation Shokz TurboPitch-enabled devices aren’t present. The overall sound is robust enough for your triathlon training, training runs, and dynamic workouts. It's also solid for those who don’t like something sitting in their ear canals and are searching for an open-ear product.</p><p>I also watched some long-form content, specifically “Blue Eye Samurai,” and the movie’s dialogue and sound design were both enjoyable and immersive. Fight scenes with all of their foley and that surround sound design are well presented and immersive. Sound separation when listening to film content is solid, like music. Your podcasts and long-form TikToks or IG Reels will come through clear and full.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-wearing-wide" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 on the reviewer's head, showing how the wrap around neckband fits" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nLKgfQ8ADd2NNqjFtoAhfb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1919" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the primary reasons people like Shokz and their OpenRun series is their locked-in feel. That continues with the OpenRun Pro 2! Without feeling like you have your head in a vice, the wraparound neckband helps keep everything in place. Because of the thin wires connecting everything, the OpenRun 2 feels great when wearing a bicycle helmet, hat, or glasses.</p><p>The other aspect of Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 that I like is the companion app. Let’s be clear: it’s pretty basic, but that isn’t a bad thing. You get four EQ presets to customize the sound to your liking and the ability to customize the sound yourself with a 5-band EQ that you can name and save. You also get multipoint pairing in the app, which works quite well. You have to pause to play music or media on your second device when you’re listening to the first one, but that’s standard for multipoint setups. I’ve only used one that switches sources on its own seamlessly.</p><p>You should also know that call quality is solid for the most part. I tested call quality while out for a walk during rush hour traffic, and it sounded pretty good! I recorded some audio in my office, which also sounded pretty good. On one call, though, my wife said I sounded like I was in a tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="well-executed-controls-faster-charging-2">Well Executed Controls, Faster Charging</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd" name="shokz-openrun-pro-2-collab-buttons.JPG" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8emw2ZV8bZsuco7qf55xd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The controls are very easy to manipulate, even when your hands are sweaty wet. On the underside of one of the frames for the transducers is where you'll find the power and volume buttons. You'll find the multifunction button on the frame where the transducer lies, which controls device functions like play/pause, track skipping, calling, and more. It's clicky and tactile and large enough to activate easily and consistently.</p><p>You'll also find the USB-C charge port on the ear frame. It's a port protected by a flap that seals tightly enough that the inside stayed dry when I ran water over it. That part is an important update as older Shokz used magnetic charging ports, which were slower to charge you back up if you drained that battery. That would be an even tougher thing to do now that the battery is rated for 12 hours instead of eight.</p><p>The USB-C charge port is also a good thing because from dead, you'll get more than 50% charge in ten minutes of USB-C charging. Five minutes gets you roughly 2.5 hours of music playback.</p><p>The trade-off with the updated charging is decreased water resistance from the standard OpenRun product. I know this is a result of losing the magnetic charge port, but the OpenRun Pro 2 has decreased durability (IP55) from the OpenRun, which is IP67. That means you can withstand sweat and some light rain but get pushed into a swimming pool or try showering with them on and bye-bye earbuds.</p>

<p>All that glitters isn’t gold, so there are some items that I think could use some improvement. The power output is low, so you must crank the volume up on your listening source. I found this true with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.</p><p>I’ve found that with open-ear products, having Hi-Res support does make a difference. The additional dynamic range of files with greater data transmission than the SBC and AAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> allow, which Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 doesn't support, often makes for audio that is a bit more audible at low volumes.</p><p>Another item I’d like to see in the next version of OpenRun Pro is the EQ settings being saved to the headset. When I switch between my Android and iOS devices, the EQ settings I have on Android aren’t shown in the iOS Shokz app. I want ubiquitous EQ configuration.</p>
<p>The only fit and comfort issue anyone will encounter will surface the first time they hit the iron. With the wrap-around headband, when you settle in for any bench work, bench press, dumbbell flys, etc., you’ll have to reposition the OpenRun 2 so they don’t get in the way.</p>

<p>Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 are their best bone-conduction headphones yet! They’re lightweight, supremely comfortable, and durable enough to meet their intended purpose. They are a wonderful improvement over the last generation, and most importantly, they provide solid sound for something that doesn’t sit inside your ear canal.</p><p>If you run, ride, or engage in really dynamic workouts and want something that feels like a 6.0-magnitude earthquake couldn’t knock them out of your ears, these should be at the top of your list.</p>

The Chinese manufacturer is aiming to build on that with the OnePlus 13, which was just introduced in China. </p><p>OnePlus made a lot of changes to the design, and the OnePlus 13 doesn&apos;t look like any other OnePlus device to date. You get the latest Qualcomm hardware, up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and new cameras with better Hasselblad tuning. </p>

<p>OnePlus unveiled the OnePlus 13 at a launch event in China on October 30, and the phone is set to go on sale starting November 4 in the country. There&apos;s no mention of a global launch just yet, but if the OnePlus 12 was any indication, we should see the OnePlus 13 make its way outside China in the month of January. </p><p>That said, Xiaomi is making the Xiaomi 15 available globally earlier than usual, so it may just be that OnePlus decides to follow suit — I&apos;ll update the post once I have additional details. </p><p>While it&apos;s good to see the OnePlus 13 picking up so many upgrades, the phone is considerably costlier than last year: the base 12GB/256GB model starts at 4,499 Yuan ($630), the 12GB/512GB edition is 4,899 Yuan ($688), the 16GB/512GB version costs 5,299 Yuan ($744), and the 24GB/1TB model is 5,999 Yuan ($842). </p><p>We don&apos;t know what the OnePlus 13 will cost globally, but there&apos;s usually a $100 increase over what the device sells for in China, so we could be looking at a $750 or even $799 starting figure. Again, this is all conjecture, and we should have details in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>OnePlus used the same design aesthetic on its devices for a while now, but that&apos;s changing with the OnePlus 13. The phone switches to flat sides — like so many devices available today — and it has a bulkier look as a result. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is available in white, blue, and black variants, and the blue model in particular looks gorgeous. I like that OnePlus always delivers at least one unique color variant each year; the Flowy Emerald OnePlus 12 was the definite star this year, and it looks like that mantle is taken up by the blue model in 2025.</p>

<p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the OnePlus 13 is available in a leather back. I&apos;m fond of the leather used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and it will be intriguing to see if the OnePlus 13 feels the same way in daily use. </p>
<p>Coming to the panel, OnePlus is once again using BOE as the manufacturer, and the OnePlus 13 retains the 6.82-inch AMOLED tech that we saw on the OnePlus 12. It has the same QHD+ resolution with 120Hz refresh, and goes up to the same 4500-nit brightness in HDR content and 1600 nits in regular use. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 has one of the best hardware packages you&apos;ll get on any device. The phone is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and it comes with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. OnePlus didn&apos;t launch this model globally last year, so it is likely that we&apos;ll get the 16GB/512GB edition alongside the base 12GB/256GB model in most global markets. </p><p>The phone has the latest connectivity, USB-C over the USB 3.2 standard, NFC, and the usual set of audio codecs. What&apos;s good to see is that it has IP69 water resistance, which is a higher tier than the usual IP68 that we see in this category. IP69 protects devices against jets of water (both hot and cold) in addition to all the usual safeguards, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-takes-things-to-a-whole-new-level-with-the-x200-series">Vivo&apos;s X200 devices</a> have the same protection. </p><p>Another upgrade is around the battery, with the device now coming with a 6000mAh battery. OnePlus is using a silicon-carbon cell to increase density, and because of the leather back and higher-density battery, the OnePlus 13 is actually lighter than the OnePlus 12. </p>

<p>The OnePlus 12 introduced a set of new sensors, allowing it to take much better photos than any other OnePlus phone to date. The OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP Sony LYT-808 main sensor, but it is joined by a new 50MP zoom lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP wide-angle lens. </p><p>The wide-angle camera on the OnePlus 12 was average, so it will be interesting to see how the OnePlus 13 holds up in this regard. Although the device is using the same main camera, OnePlus is making changes to its camera algorithms to eke out better photos, and with Hasselblad tuning intact, the device should deliver photos and videos with better details — I&apos;ll put this to the test once I get my hands on the device. </p>

<p>With the OnePlus 13 debuting in China, we don&apos;t have to wait long to know more about the device&apos;s global availability. It&apos;s likely the device will head outside China in January, but with manufacturers wanting to launch their phones earlier than usual, it&apos;s not unreasonable to assume the device will make its global debut in Q4 2024 itself.  </p>
