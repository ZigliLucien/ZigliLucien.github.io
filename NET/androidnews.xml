<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is one heck of an expensive device. It isn&apos;t much different from the Galaxy Z Fold 5, but you can&apos;t use the older screen protectors on it.

Between having to sit still for hours and having little to do, these kinds of flights are generally no fun. And forget about working on a plane unless you enjoy neck pain or the potential of having your laptop smashed by the reclining seat in front of you.</p><p>That&apos;s why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">Meta Quest 3&apos;s airplane mode</a> is such a godsend. It allows the headset to be used on a plane and it works incredibly well, as is proven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEWD19ZS5Ww">countless</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO7Gs5JgBOQ">YouTube</a> videos and other customer feedback. But I haven&apos;t been able to adequately use the feature yet for one good reason: I can&apos;t fit the headset in my luggage.</p><p>As I was packing for my trip to see Samsung&apos;s latest at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-z-fold-6-flip-6-and-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Unpacked July 2024</a>, I realized that my suitcase was quickly running out of room. For a three-day trip, I had to pack clothes, electronics, my camera, cables, and all sorts of things into a suitcase and a backpack. Once all that was packed, I had a tiny cube of space that a VR headset simply wouldn&apos;t fit into.</p><p>It&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve run into time and time again over the past few weeks since the feature debuted — I travel quite a bit for this job — and while I&apos;m still going to try to fit it into a future trip, it&apos;s clear that the size of modern VR headsets is still prohibitive to some of the things we desperately want to use them for.</p>

<p>While everyone&apos;s travel situations are different, I&apos;ve found that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">best smart glasses</a> are better travel companions because of their smaller size. While most of these glasses are quite as small as a standard pair of glasses — that&apos;s especially true of smart display glasses like my favorite pair, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-Glasses-UltraClarity-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/">Viture Pro</a> — they&apos;re still substantially smaller than any standalone VR headset on the market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Smart display glasses are a much better travel companion because of the size and ease of use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Smart display glasses are effectively a giant virtual monitor that rests on your face. They attach to any device that supports USB-C display output — your phone, laptop, or even the Steam Deck — giving you the ability to relax and hold your head in a natural position instead of craning your neck down the whole time.</p><p>My colleague, Andrew Myrick, recently took Xreal Air 2s on a trip with him and they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">saved him from neck pain</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La" name="meta-quest-3-travel-case-versus-viture-one-travel-case.jpg" alt="Comparing the size of the Meta Quest 3 and Viture One travel cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vo5jAr9PNJfxPpRq286La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Meta Quest headsets don&apos;t support this feature. You either have to sideload videos onto your headset and use a 3rd party app to play them — not something that&apos;s super user-friendly — or play an offline VR game you might have installed on your headset.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If the size didn't stop me, the fact that I can't plug my laptop directly into a Quest and use it as a virtual monitor would.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>There&apos;s little hope of using one for working on a plane because you&apos;d need to connect to your laptop over a Wi-Fi network, and that usually doesn&apos;t work well on a plane.</p><p>I&apos;d <em>prefer</em> to use the Quest because the field of view is significantly wider than any pair of smart glasses on the market and I generally find the Quest&apos;s design quite comfortable over time, especially when using a headstrap like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-Pro-Accessories-conditioning-hot-swappable/dp/B0CSY8PD63/">BoboVR S3 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>It also does head tracking better than any pair of smart glasses on the market, making it feel more like you actually have a TV or monitor in front physically residing in front of you. Most smart glasses pin the display to your vision, meaning it moves around with your head. That can be particularly uncomfortable when there&apos;s turbulence on a plane, as trying to follow bouncy text can cause nausea.</p><p>The ironic thing is that smart glasses are often just as expensive as a Meta Quest headset. That feels a little silly, given that the Quest is a completely standalone console and the smart glasses are <em>just</em> a monitor, but sometimes you have to pay for convenience.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest carrying cases</a> can protect your Quest while traveling, but until the headsets get a lot smaller, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be taking one on too many flights.</p>

It&apos;s yet another shift after the Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6 Classic, but we suspect Samsung will stick with a Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 next year.</p><p>After Apple cleared the way to sell smartwatches for the price of a smartphone, Samsung quickly followed suit. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra hands-on</a> showcases all the ways it mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. During a private Q&A session, Samsung engineers told us they&apos;re focusing on making the "most premium" watch due to "market" forces, leaving its old Pro behind.</p><p>That&apos;s why we assume the Ultra series is here to stay, and that Samsung will release a Watch Ultra 2 next year. So, what do we expect Samsung to change next year, and what do we <em>want</em> them to change? Here&apos;s our Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 wishlist.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-crown-buttons-bezel-anything-2">Add a crown, buttons, bezel...anything!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-underside.jpg" alt="The underside of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtGTT9UNzq2GXyKUdxpzFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite borrowing many design decisions from the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-ultra-copies-apple-watch-ultra-except-for-most-important-feature">didn&apos;t copy Apple in one key way</a>: there&apos;s no crown. Nor did Samsung give the Watch Ultra a physical or digital rotating bezel. You can only use touchscreen swipes and buttons to navigate. </p><p>Rugged titanium watches like these aren&apos;t strictly for athletes; many people buy them for the design, battery life, and extra protection. But for anyone wanting to use the Watch Ultra&apos;s dual-band GPS or new route-racing tool, you might be disappointed by the lack of tactile options when you&apos;re mid-run with sweaty fingertips.</p><p>We don&apos;t care <em>what</em> Samsung adds to the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, as long as it&apos;s some physical option. A physical bezel like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>&apos;s might make it too heavy, so Samsung could consider adding a crown like many other Android watch-makers (Google Pixel, Ticwatch) or subtle buttons on the left-hand side like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> can stick with the digital bezel to keep it lightweight, if Samsung wants.</p>
<h2 id="new-health-tools-2">New health tools</h2>

<p>Samsung gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and Ultra 13 LEDs instead of four on the Watch 6, which supposedly makes them significantly more accurate for heart rate and blood oxygen data (especially during workouts). It says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">revamped Biosensor</a> can track your body&apos;s Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index, which is a warning sign for future body health issues like diabetes and heart failure.</p><p>We love this focus on health accuracy, combined with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> launch for better sleep tracking! We&apos;ve yet to test the improved HR sensors for ourselves, but we&apos;re optimistic. So we&apos;ll simply hope that the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 continues prioritizing health.</p><p>Maybe Samsung will finally make its blood pressure data accurate enough that the FDA approves it for U.S. usage. Or it&apos;ll jump from AGEs tracking to fully tracking blood glucose levels, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Samsung execs have said they&apos;re pursuing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="training-load-and-workout-recs-2">Training load and workout recs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-multisport.jpg" alt="Choosing a workout after pressing the action button on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qpJnapdbpe3EQfh7JtHvw.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung&apos;s big fitness update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> is its "Energy Score." It takes your heart rate, HRV, recent activities, and sleep quality to tell you how much energy you have for the day. It&apos;s a long-standing, popular feature on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> like Fitbit (Daily Readiness Score) and Garmin (Body Battery). Plus, Samsung added an FTP cycling test and new aerobic and anaerobic threshold heart rate zones.</p><p>When Wear OS 6 or 5.5 rolls around next year, we hope that Samsung takes things a step further from general body energy to physical readiness. Some watches will look at your recent activities and judge that you may be well-rested but still too sore to work out, recommending you wait X hours before your next one.</p><p>The other popular workout tool offered by Garmin and Apple is training load. It judges how your last week&apos;s workout intensity compares to past weeks, so you have data showing if you&apos;re improving or declining over time.</p><p>If Samsung gives the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 better tactile controls <em>and</em> new training load data, it&apos;ll quickly become one of the go-to fitness watch options for Android users, even compared to Garmin.</p>
<h2 id="going-full-squircle-2">Going full squircle?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5oNNwKxJoYJXY33fs2JafG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-information-watch-face-01.jpg" alt="A detailed informational watch face on the  Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oNNwKxJoYJXY33fs2JafG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In March 2024, we heard a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">report</a> that Samsung executives "enthusiastically" considered a plan to "bring back the squarish design for its smartwatches" for the first time since the Gear S in 2014.</p><p>One could argue that the Galaxy Watch Ultra <em>is</em> a return to a squarish design. The 1.5-inch circular display sits atop a squircle slab of metal, which is certainly unique! But that space is entirely cosmetic, adding weight without adding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rumored-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-has-one-path-to-success">utility of extra display space</a>.</p><p>If Samsung continues to emulate Apple&apos;s design decisions, switching fully to a squircle display would be the next step. That&apos;s not a guarantee, and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">long-time Android watch users would hate that switch</a>, but it&apos;s a possibility.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, informed reporters that it will bring a generative AI overhaul to its AI assistant Bixby later "this year."</li><li>Roh added that the company sees such AI advancements as a "driver" for consumer interest and hopes to bring "convenience."</li><li>Google's Rick Osterloh was on stage during Unpacked to discuss the partnership with Samsung as both companies look to advance AI together.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following uncertain whispers, Samsung has come forward with information about how it will proceed with its AI assistant, Bixby.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile Business, TM Roh, spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/samsung-to-launch-upgraded-bixby-this-year-with-its-own-ai.html">CNBC</a> and confirmed that the company plans to overhaul Bixby "this year." Following Unpacked, Roh stated, "we’re going to advance Bixby with application of Gen AI technology." It seems that Samsung is interested in pushing the number of available generative AI features it provides and markets to consumers via its Galaxy devices.</p><p>Roh added, "as consumers use more AI capabilities, they can actually feel the convenience and benefits they bring. I believe strongly that these Galaxy AI and mobile AI are strong motivations and drivers for the purchase of new products."</p><p>However, despite Samsung&apos;s efforts to rapidly integrate more of its AI software into its devices, Galaxy products will still offer other options. Roh informed CNBC that Samsung will "maintain its strategy" of displaying multiple AI assistant options on its devices rather than just Galaxy AI.</p><p>Still, Roh did not divulge more about the specifics behind Bixby&apos;s upgrade slated for later in 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">Following the rumors in April</a>, we&apos;re we&apos;re finally getting confirmation of additional AI assistant upgrades. It was previously speculated that Samsung would move to bring Gen AI features to Bixby inspired by the work done at OpenAI for ChatGPT.</p><p>The rumor&apos;s source claimed that Samsung needed to "redefine" the purpose of Bixby due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">rise of LLMs</a> and generative AI features in a multitude of mediums.</p>

Osterloh also reiterated Google and Samsung&apos;s partnership and how both brands have "revolutionized the mobile experience for billions of users."</p><p>Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-boast-ai-upgrades-and-thinner-bodies">Flip 6 and Fold 6</a>, are preparing to receive new Gemini features.

It does have a faster Exynos chip and extra storage, plus revamped heart rate LEDs and dual-band GPS; still, it has the same look, displays, health data, and battery life as the Watch 6.

<p>Back in March, a SamMobile report claimed that Samsung executives wanted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">switch from its long-running circular Galaxy Watch design</a> for a squircle design, one it hadn&apos;t used since the Samsung Gear S in 2014 (see above).</p><p>"The idea is enthusiastically being considered internally," the report claimed.</p><p>We wrote at the time that Samsung couldn&apos;t redesign the Galaxy Watch 7 by the summer, but that the Galaxy Watch 8 would be a natural candidate for a major design switch if this report is true.</p><p>Of course, many people would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">hate a squircle Galaxy Watch</a>, since it reminds them too much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a>. But after Samsung aped Apple by selling a square-shaped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> — leaving behind its own Pro and Classic designs of models past — it might continue this trend in 2025 with a square-display Galaxy Watch 8.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NpxT6FaibX4YQZa5e7HTqJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-activity-rings.jpeg" alt="Closed activity rings on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NpxT6FaibX4YQZa5e7HTqJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We later heard via South Korean news site <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/english/11000625" target="_blank">Pulse News</a> that Hon Pak, Samsung&apos;s vice president and head of digital healthcare, wants to bring new health tracking features to Galaxy Watches, specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">blood glucose and diabetes monitoring</a>.</p><p>That same report claimed Samsung would develop the technology "as early as the second half of 2024," despite previous reports that blood glucose monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">would take a few years to arrive</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 may not have blood glucose, but it <em>does</em> have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">revamped Biosensor</a> capable of tracking your body&apos;s Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index. AGEs form when sugars interact with proteins or fats in your bloodstream, and they signal potential health conditions like diabetes or renal failure.</p><p>Evidently, Samsung intends to continue tracking new health vectors over time, using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> to improve the results. So we can expect the Galaxy Watch 8 to continue this health-tracking revolution, whether it adds blood glucose or something more attainable.</p><p>We&apos;ve yet to hear more information — not surprising, given we&apos;re a year out from the Galaxy Watch 8 — but we&apos;ll keep this hub updated with any other leaks as they come in.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 made some significant upgrades: A faster Exynos chip, double the storage, a daily energy score based on sleep and fitness data, three times the LEDs for more accurate health tracking, sleep apnea detection, and more. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7 hands-on</a> time gave us a clear look at what to expect.</p><p>So, aside from a possible squircle display swap, where can the Galaxy Watch 8 improve? This is the Android Central staff&apos;s wishlist for Galaxy Watch 8 features:</p><p><strong>Bring back the Classic or Pro</strong></p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra is an exciting product for serious athletes, with a totally rugged design and unique perks like a third "quick button" for shortcuts and an emergency siren. It&apos;s also $650, which is significantly cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> but still $200 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, Samsung&apos;s last titanium watch with long battery life.</p><p>Samsung told us in a Q&A session that it intends to keep selling the Watch 6 Classic, just like the Watch 5 Pro stayed in stock for two years. But there&apos;s still a gap for users who want a rotating bezel or extra battery life without needing every premium Ultra perk or accepting last-gen specs.</p><p>Our guess is that Samsung will deprecate its Classic and Pro watches in the short term, but we wouldn&apos;t mind being proven wrong! Just as Samsung sells three flagship phones, we think there&apos;s enough room for a mid-range option between the affordable Galaxy Watch 8 and the inevitable Galaxy Watch Ultra 2.</p><p><strong>Dare we say...a crown?</strong></p><p>Look, the Watch 7&apos;s digital bezel has always felt like a compromise compared to the physical bezel of Classic Galaxy Watches. It works, but haptic clicks aren&apos;t the same as the physical experience of turning a dial or crown. On the other hand, the Classic look makes Samsung watches much heavier and more expensive.</p><p>A lot of Android Central writers love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, in part because of the simplicity of using a dial instead of a touch bezel. It&apos;s the best alternative we can think of, and it&apos;s one that Samsung seems likely to use (since Apple loves its crowns, and Samsung has started emulating its rival&apos;s design choices).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LZnZruJKF3nWgV27yUZn7R" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-watch-ultra-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZnZruJKF3nWgV27yUZn7R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Samsung gave the Watch 7 (left) a digital bezel and the Watch Ultra (right) no bezel or crown at all. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Improve the core battery life</strong></p><p>Samsung&apos;s last four smartwatches have had an estimated battery life of 40, 50, 40, and 40 hours, respectively. Aside from that Galaxy Watch 5 blip, it&apos;s stuck to that number, ensuring that new watches with faster processors and new features remain efficient enough to last. With the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you get 60 hours of battery life with AOD activated, or up to 100 hours in power saver mode.</p><p>Samsung, like Apple, makes you pay for higher-end models to get better battery life. But we&apos;ve seen recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> set to last from 80–100 hours in the same price range as the standard Watch 7. Google has even implemented a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a> that makes certain background functions use less battery life.</p><p>We can only hope Samsung evolves with the rest of the field and makes better battery life more of a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Continue to upgrade the health and fitness features</strong></p><p>With the Galaxy Watch 7, Samsung catered more to athletes with improved sensors, a daily Energy Score similar to other brands&apos; Daily Readiness or Body Battery scores, cycling FTP tests, and the ability to race your past routes. And the Galaxy Watch Ultra added dual-band GPS with a respectable 16 hours of tracking.</p><p>We appreciate that Samsung has chosen to take fitness more seriously, but you can still find plenty of areas where Samsung falls behind the pack.</p><p>Apple added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/what-is-training-load-on-watchos-11-the-new-feature-coming-to-apple-watch-that-will-change-your-workouts-forever">training load</a> to watchOS 11, so you can judge how your recent effort compares to past weeks&apos; and to your body&apos;s overall fitness level. You can also take rest days where you disable your daily rings when you&apos;re too tired, injured, or sick to keep up your streaks. Samsung should feel free to borrow these ideas, since Apple borrowed training load from other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>.</p><p>Otherwise, since Samsung wants to make AI a major focus of its devices, we hope to see some kind of coaching AI tool on the next Wear OS update, giving recommendations on how long to walk, run, cycle, lift, or complete other workouts on a given day to improve.</p>

<p>We have a long time until we start to see proper Galaxy Watch 8 leaks from Samsung's offices.

The Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 does support the S Pen, but not all models are supported.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="there-is-good-news-and-bad-news-regarding-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-the-s-pen-2">There is good news and bad news regarding the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the S Pen</h2>
<p>When you have a display such as the one found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, you can&apos;t help but wonder if it supports the S Pen. The previous model supports it, so why shouldn&apos;t the latest one?</p><p>The good news is that the latest Samsung foldable supports the S pen, but the bad news is that it is a separate purchase. The S Pen models compatible with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are the S Pen Fold Edition and the S Pen Pro. However, they don&apos;t come in the box, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 does not have a design like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that allows you to carry it inside the chassis. If you decide to get an S Pen, you can also get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">Galaxy Z Fold 6 case</a> that allows you to easily store it on the back.</p><p>You can only use the S Pen on the main screen, not the external one. Remember that the S Pen Creator edition will not work on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. If you get the S Pen Fold Edition, you get a special case to put it away in, but that is not the case with the S Pen Pro edition. Another difference between the two S Pen variants is that the Pro version has Bluetooth functionality and two buttons, while the Fold Edition doesn&apos;t. Therefore, it doesn&apos;t need to be charged and only has one button.</p><p>The specifications they have in common are the 2.8ms latency and the auto-retractable Pro Tip. You can start using the S Pen Fold Edition on your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 as soon as you take it out of the box, no setup required. However, you&apos;ll need to charge the S Pen Pro using a USB-C cable and set the mode to match your new Z Fold phone. If you happen to use an incompatible S Pen, your Z Fold will show you a pop-up message letting you know.</p><p>If you don&apos;t want to worry about charging another accessory, you can always go with the S Pen Fold Edition. It&apos;s currently available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/phones/galaxy-z-fold5-s-pen-fold-edition-black-ej-pf946bbegus/">Samsung&apos;s official site for $55</a>, but you can also get it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098TTKX6J/?tag=androidpolice-20&ascsubtag=UUapUeUpU55241&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fs-pen-fold-edition-vs-s-pen-pro%2F&asc_campaign=Commerce&th=1">Amazon for $50</a>. Be careful not to get the S Pen you would use with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra since they are incompatible. The Z Fold series requires a stylus with a soft tip due to the difference in screen technologies. It&apos;s best to avoid buying a stylus from cheap and unknown brands since you can get stuck with one that doesn&apos;t work or, worse, one that damages the display.</p>

The perfect preorder deal for you is going to depend on your own wireless needs, but I&apos;m naming Best Buy&apos;s deal as the best of the bunch. Preordering the innovative foldable through the retailer&apos;s site gets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6-512gb-unlocked-yellow/6586741.p"><strong>a free $200 gift card</strong></a>, a complimentary storage upgrade, and up to $460 of trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken phone.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 hits store shelves July 24th, but you can order the clamshell device from Best Buy today and receive a free $200 gift card, a complimentary storage boost to 512GB (a $120 value), and up to $460 off when you trade in an old or broken phone.</p>
<p>As noted in our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 6 hands-on review</a>, the foldable phone improves upon its predecessor by incorporating a faster Snapdragon chipset, a 50MP primary camera sensor, and seven years of OS upgrades straight out of the box.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-flip6-512gb-unlocked-yellow/6586741.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8e6c16a2-c9a6-4ba0-ad0e-0d935577d69e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219.99" data-dimension48="$1,219.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want Samsung&apos;s newest clamshell foldable phone; you like to buy smartphones unlocked.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can get a better deal through your wireless carrier; you&apos;re more drawn to the look and feel of Motorola&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus (2024)</a>.</p><p>How does this offer compare to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-preorder-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 6 preorder deals</a>? Well, let&apos;s break it down. For starters, Best Buy&apos;s deal rises above some others because of its simplicity. Sure, you could get some epic savings from Verizon or AT&T if you process a trade-in and add a line, but you&apos;ll also be locked into 36 months of an unlimited plan. That might work for you, but some folks don&apos;t want to switch wireless plans or upgrade just to enjoy a new phone.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s preorder deal is also quite good, offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-512gb-unlocked-sm-f741uakexaa/"><strong>up to $1,000 of trade-in credit</strong></a> alongside a free storage upgrade and some exclusive color options, but you&apos;ll likely need to activate through a carrier to get the maximum savings. Just like Best Buy, Amazon is offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Storage-Preorder-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D19B2D19"><strong>$200 gift card</strong></a> and a free storage upgrade, but you&apos;ll lose out on the trade-in credit and free month of Xbox Game Pass Unlimited.</p><p>All things said and done, if you&apos;re willing or able to meet the eligibility requirements set by a Big Three carrier (Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile), then by all means, go with their preorder deal. But if you prefer to buy your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> unlocked, Best Buy is the winner this time.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Fold 6 on July 10 and the device packs a convenient new method for setting up fingerprints.</li><li>Now, Fold 6 owners can set up a new fingerprint when the device is closed by pressing their finger against its "Side" button to complete the process.</li><li>Users may have to dive into their biometric settings to do this as the Fodl 6's initial setup process isn't offering a chance to do so.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve only just gotten our hands on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and some of its QoL changes are taking the spotlight.</p><p>Discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/11/galaxy-z-fold-6-fingerprint-enrollment/">9to5Google</a>, Samsung&apos;s 2024 book-style foldable has finally refined its new fingerprint setup process in a way that makes sense. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">Fold 6</a> owners can set their biometric unlock directly from the side of the device when closed. Built into the frame, Samsung explains that users can place their desired finger on the "Side" button until they feel a vibration.</p><p>Doing things this way should feel a little more comfortable as the Fold 6 when closed, is much smaller and fits in the palm of your hand. Users can watch the fingerprint sensor fill the fun graphic until completion, as well.</p><p>The publication also noted that Samsung previously required users to open the Fold to set up a new desired fingerprint. It may have felt odd for some users to do this, especially given how large the Fold&apos;s display typically is (7.6 inches for the Fold 6).</p>

<p>This convenient change to the Fold 6&apos;s fingerprint enrollment process might take your mind off the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-no-longer-prompts-you-to-set-up-a-fingerprint">initial setup bug</a>. Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick discovered an unusual change with Samsung&apos;s latest foldable, stating that the Fold 6 no longer prompts users to set up their biometrics.</p><p>With the device&apos;s "Side" button embedded into its frame, it&apos;s quite easy for folks to set up their fingerprints to unlock their device if desired.

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is surprisingly feature-rich for being the “budget” option in the line. If you’re just looking to get into the smartwatch space or just switched to a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and want a smartwatch to match, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is a good starter option. It isn’t as snappy, doesn’t have as high resolution a screen, has a smaller battery and lacks the newest features. But as a solid smartwatch at an affordable price, it's worth considering.</p></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a new smartwatch and you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, chances are you’re considering a Galaxy Watch to match. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Galaxy Watch FE are two options to consider. The former is the latest in the line while the latter is a more affordable version that will meet some user’s needs. Do you need to step up to the newest model or will the FE model suffice? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>, introduced in the summer of 2024, comes in two sizes: the 40mm comes in Green or Cream and the larger 44mm model in Green or Silver. It has a Sapphire Crystal display that’s 1.3 inches in the smaller version and 1.5 inches in the larger. It’s a full-color, always-on AMOLED display that boasts 480 x 480 resolution with the larger one and 432 x 432 resolution with the smaller one. The screen is complemented by two side buttons.</p><p>It comes with a new selection of watch bands with a ripple shape design that gives it a more rugged look and colorful stitch details. There are also new watch faces from which to choose. The watch meets 5ATM and IP68 ratings for water and dust resistance as well as MIL-STD-810H standards, ensuring that it’s durable and can withstand the rigors of daily use.</p><p>Running on WearOS 5 (powered by Samsung) with One UI 6 Watch, you get all the same personalization, customization, app access, Google integration, and more than you’d expect from a Samsung Galaxy watch. There are some new usability features as well, including Suggested replies using Galaxy AI, which will intelligently suggest responses you can send right from your wrist based on previous conversations. Use new double pinch gestures as well to control the watch if your hands are full.</p><p>The battery is 300mAh and 425mAh, depending on the model, and it supports fast charging using WPC-based wireless chargers. Additional features include Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi, NFC, built-in GPS, and an LTE option for those who want to be able to connect and receive notifications or navigate without requiring a phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.36%;"><img id="HgQU8ks4Ew6VNRCzNJGHRi" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch FE blue pink black colors.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HgQU8ks4Ew6VNRCzNJGHRi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="692" height="390" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE compare? As an entry model that launched just a month prior to the Galaxy Watch 7, it comes in only one size, 40mm, with a similar circular face and two side buttons. The screen is slightly smaller than the smaller Galaxy Watch 7 at 1.2 inches, and it’s also a sapphire crystal AMOLED. Resolution is slightly lower than the smaller Galaxy Watch 7 at 396 x 396 pixels.</p><p>It comes in Black, Pink Gold, and Silver with its own selection of watch bands with blue and orange stitching along with customizable watch faces. The Galaxy Watch FE also meets 5ATM, IP68, and MIL-STD-810H standards, so even though it’s considered a budget model in the line, it’s still pretty durable.</p><p>Additional features include Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, built-in GPS, and an LTE option. It, too, runs on WearOS, affording access to popular apps, from Google Maps to YouTube Music, and other third-party as well as Samsung options. Both also work with Samsung Wallet for paying for items from your wrist or accessing digital ID cards and more.</p><p>Both smartwatches seamlessly connect with other Samsung Galaxy devices, like smartphones, tablets, and earbuds; and work with features like Find My Phone. The new Galaxy Watch 7 adds the option to connect with the new Samsung Galaxy Ring as well, with both working in tandem to track your health, wellness, exercise, and most importantly, sleep.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch FE: Specs</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at the run-down of basic specs to compare these two Galaxy smartwatches.</p>

<p>Aside from the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 offering a larger version, the specs between these two smartwatches are very similar. There are differences that lie deeper, though.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-features-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch FE: Features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBGxPJsjiLDuWgHKYZpF4B" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-health-sensors-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBGxPJsjiLDuWgHKYZpF4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s consider the health, wellness, and other features these two smartwatches have to offer.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 runs on an Exynos W1000 five-core processor and the most powerful chip in the Galaxy line-up to date, making it presumably snappy and responsive. Samsung says the CPU is three times faster and power efficiency has been improved by 30 percent. As noted, it’s powered by the latest WearOS 5 version (powered by Samsung) and includes the One UI 6 Watch for further personalization and customization of the look.</p><p>Samsung’s BioActive Sensor is core to all of its latest smartwatches, and the Galaxy Watch 7 is no exception. It includes a myriad of sensors for tracking everything from heart rate to temperature, and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), an estimation of your body composition.</p><p>Able to track more than 100 different workout types, you can also build routines by combining different exercises to make your own custom workout routine. There’s also a Race feature, which you can use to compare current and past performance in real-time, a great feature for runners. Body Composition, tracked via BIA, will provide a snapshot of your body makeup to help you understand it better.</p><p>The watch boasts a new advanced AI algorithm for sleep analysis that includes a new FDA-authorized Sleep Apnea feature provided by De Novo. It can help look for signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea. The Watch can also provide real-time readings and alerts for high or low heart rates, detect irregular heart rhythms that could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), and allow you to take an ECG.</p><p>One of the new features in the Galaxy Watch 7 is the ability to track glycation end products (AGEs) using the AGEx Index, which reflects your overall biological aging process and metabolic health. This is largely influenced by diet and lifestyle, so the measurement can help prompt you to make changes to either (or both) if you notice that the numbers are off.</p><p>Another improvement of the Galaxy Watch 7 is a dual-frequency GPS system, which offers more precise location tracking, even when traveling in dense urban environments. For those who like to run on unfamiliar trails, go hiking, or other exploratory activities, especially if you opt for an LTE version of the watch to travel without your phone, this is a big deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-press-photo-running.jpeg" alt="A photo of a woman running while wearing the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N627yqjsmPa4gr54wEYxLi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="908" height="511" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE runs on the less powerful Exynos W920 dual-core processor, which is to be expected given the differential in price. To put this in perspective, that’s the same processor found in the older Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 5 models. It’s also powered by WearOS with Samsung One UI 5 Watch, making it a generation behind in this respect.</p><p>Along with Samsung’s BioActive Sensor and all the goodies that come with it, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE focuses on sleep as well. It has advanced sleep features, including the ability to monitor sleep patterns, provide sleep coaching, and tips to create a better environment for quality rest. But it does not have the new Sleep Apnea feature.</p><p>You get the same low and high heart rate alerts along with heart rhythm monitoring to detect signs of Afib, and you can take an ECG reading as well, impressive given that this is the entry smartwatch model.</p><p>This watch can also track more than 100 workouts, and it has advanced running analysis to track performance along with features like personalized heart rate zones and custom goal setting. There’s also body composition tracking, so you get a lot for a low price with this model.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-buttons-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLSPhFFayHEWQZWzUZRRmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Decisions, decisions. It’s often tempting to get the newer model of the two, but when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Galaxy Watch FE, they are both new models. The Galaxy Watch 7 is the latest option in the line, joined by the ultra-rugged (and much more expensive) Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch FE, meanwhile, is designed to be an entry-level option for those just getting into the smartwatch realm or wanting to try out a Samsung Galaxy model for the first time. In fact, we name it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">the best budget Samsung smartwatch</a> you can buy.</p><p>You’ll get a slower processor, shorter battery life, and fewer features with the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE. It’s also only available in the one smaller size, so if you have thicker or larger wrists, that might be reason alone to jump to the larger-sized Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 version. If you want the Samsung Galaxy Ring as well, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is the model for you.</p><p>But both are recent smartwatches with the same level of durability, compatibility, BioActive Sensors, and LTE options. So it may come down to budget. If you don’t want to spend too much and just want to test the waters, go with the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE. If you’re looking for something more advanced and will leverage features like the new Sleep Apnea monitoring, AGEs index, double pince gestures, and suggested replies, save up a bit more and get the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>Both are great, new Samsung Galaxy smartwatches that will be a fabulous companion to a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, or an option worth considering to use with any Android device.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>A perfect starter option</strong></em></p>
<p>If you want a smartwatch that can do it all but doesn’t come with a price tag to match, the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE is designed for you. It might not have the added new features of the Galaxy Watch 7, nor as fast a processor or big a battery. But it’s still a new model and tracks most of the same metrics. If you are pinching pennies, you won’t be disappointed by choosing this model instead.</p></p>
