It looks similar to the GTS 4 Mini but it comes in a larger case. It also cuts back on the bezel, so you get a larger display area. The rotating crown allows for smooth and easy UI navigation, too. As is the case with most smartwatches, the overall battery life will vary depending on usage, but you can expect eight days with typical use. The battery-saver mode allows you to stretch the battery life up to 16 days.</p><p>There are several key features that make this watch so desirable, including built-in dual-band GPS, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, stress monitoring, sleep tracking, and so on. There are also over 150 sports modes such as outdoor running, walking, outdoor cycling, treadmill, pool swimming, and elliptical. It also has both online and offline voice assistants with Alexa, which can be mighty convenient at times. Whether you&apos;re starting a workout or asking a general question, your watch will respond quickly and efficiently. Since the GTS 4 has a mic and speakers onboard, you get replies on the watch. This also means you can answer phone calls right from your wrist.</p><p>While NFC payments are quite popular on smartwatches these days, they&apos;re not available on the U.S. version of this watch. Another drawback is that other than Amazfit&apos;s native apps, there is no third-party app support. This means you can&apos;t access any of the cool Wear OS apps found on the Google Play Store. If you want something chunkier with a little more battery life, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-4-vs-gts-4">Amazfit GTR 4 might be better</a> for you.</p>

<p>When you want a solid set of smartwatch features but don&apos;t want to break the bank in the process, you may want to take a look at the Amazfit Bip 3. It offers the lovely rectangular design that many users have come to prefer. You get a 44mm polycarbonate case that&apos;s not too large or bulky, which weighs in at 33 grams. It has a 1.69-inch full-color TFT display, so it won&apos;t be as sharp as a watch with an AMOLED display. The Bip 3 is available in Black, Blue, and Pink.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is as long as some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. There are 60+ sports modes to choose from on the Amazfit Bip 3, including outdoor running, treadmill running, and outdoor cycling. You&apos;ll also find some rather unique sports modes such as yoga, cricket, table tennis, and basketball.</p><p>There are some disadvantages to the Amazfit Bip 3, including clunky notifications that are spaced out and hard to read at times. You also won&apos;t have music storage on the watch. When using the Alexa built-in feature, it relies on your phone&apos;s connection, which isn&apos;t always as seamless as it should be.</p>

<p>The Amazfit GTR 4 is a superb choice for users who don&apos;t want to sacrifice their love of fashion just because they&apos;re buying a smartwatch.

It claims up to 14 days, but with notifications enabled, always-on mode, and background health tracking, you&apos;ll likely come closer to eight days of juice, which isn&apos;t bad at all. It comes with a 5 ATM water resistance rating and excellent fitness tracking that includes over 150 sports modes. Some other features include heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, blood oxygen monitoring, and more.</p><p>To put it simply, if you&apos;re seeking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> that&apos;s still very aesthetically pleasing, you&apos;ll likely be quite happy with the Amazfit GTR 4. Much like any other Amazfit smartwatch, you can&apos;t answer text messages as there&apos;s no on-screen keyboard. You can, however, answer calls since the GTR 4 has speakers and a microphone.</p>

<p>At almost 48mm in diameter, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-t-rex-ultra-review">Amazfit T-Rex Ultra</a> is not messing around. The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique color options, including Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation. There are also four side buttons that you can use to navigate that watch if that&apos;s your preferred method. The best thing about this design, especially for outdoor enthusiasts, is its military-grade durability. This is easily one of the toughest watches out there as it has passed 15 military-grade tests as opposed to 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter where you&apos;re headed or how long you plan to be there, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for long battery life. With typical use, you can expect this beast to last for up to 20 days. Those who will be heavily using their smartwatch can expect to average around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery life will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the health and activity features of the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra. You&apos;ll have over 160 sports modes to choose from, including the basics such as outdoor cycling, treadmill running and trail running, and walking. You can also record more specific activities such as hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you&apos;ll also be able to track your route with the built-in advanced GPS. You&apos;ll have heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p>

<p>For serious runners out there, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Cheetah Pro</a> is well worth considering as the Amazfit watch that will best suit your needs. Firstly, the GPS features are beyond what most smartwatches can offer, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals, as opposed to the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market. Its slew of features including 24hr monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes make it well worth the price tag too, with over 100 apps to choose from and multiple face options, allowing you to tailor the watch to suit your needs. </p><p>There are arguably a little too many features here though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming amount of options that don&apos;t work quite as well as they should, which gives the sense that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining here. While running though, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive too, with the amount of features justifying a purchase for serious runners. </p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive too, but is a little inconsistent during use. Overall though, the Cheetah Pro is very impressive, but is a little more niche than other offerings on this list. If you are into running though, this is definitely the watch for you.</p>

This new-and-improved model comes in a large 43mm case, which makes it one of the bigger watches in the Amazfit lineup. It comes in a sturdy stainless steel body combined with reinforced plastic, which keeps it light without the strap. The watch comes with a 20mm interchangeable silicone sports band that can handle all of your intense activities. You can use the touchscreen on the 1.28-inch AMOLED display to navigate your watch or you can use the side button if you prefer.</p><p>The Amazfit GTR Mini gives you seven days of battery with typical usage.

You&apos;ll have 5 ATM water resistance, heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and local music storage.</p><p>There&apos;s an unprecedented amount of sports modes on this watch — easily over 120. All of the basics are present, including walking, treadmill, trail running, cycling, and swimming. There are also more specific sports modes for serious athletes, like multisport, triathlon, football, rowing, tennis, climbing, and so on.</p><p>You&apos;ll also be able to measure your fitness level, recovery time, and training load. It&apos;s perfect for athletes who want to improve their performance. Some users might appreciate the generous size, but it may not be ideal for those with tiny wrists. Finally, the lack of speakers and a mic is a bummer on a wearable of this magnitude. The smartwatch also lacks third-party app support. You won&apos;t find an app store, but it does offer widget options, including a stopwatch, compass, alarm, and weather.</p>

You also get a brilliant AMOLED display and touchscreen that&apos;s perfect for quick navigation.</p><p>Similar to the other options on this list, the battery life on the Amazfit GTS 4 Mini can vary depending on usage. It should last for up to a week with typical use. It weighs less than 20 grams, so it&apos;s one of the lightest wearables on the market. If you&apos;re a fitness enthusiast or you simply have a tiny wrist, this is one of the best Amazfit smartwatches you can buy. Speaking of which, you get great health and fitness features, including GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, 120+ sport modes, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p><p>Considering the low price tag, you probably won&apos;t be too surprised to learn about some of the drawbacks. For starters, there&apos;s no support for third-party apps. This might not be a deal-breaker for beginners, but it&apos;s still worth noting. You can control your smartphone&apos;s music, but you won&apos;t have storage on the watch for songs. If you can live without these extras, you may have just met your smartwatch match.</p>

<p>Amazfit doesn&apos;t have many ultra-premium smartwatches, but the ones it does make are superb for fitness tracking.

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s decision to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 series</a> with seven years of full OS upgrades both drew praise and criticism. Some applauded Google for committing to the lengthy level of support that will hopefully keep Pixel phones running for longer. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">others were skeptical</a>, wondering what a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro would even look like in 2030. </p><p>We finally have an answer, as Google&apos;s Vice President of Devices and Services, Seang Chau, spoke about the promise on the latest episode of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/made-by-google-podcast">Made by Google podcast</a>.</p><p>According to Chau, Google&apos;s shift to using custom Tensor processors in recent smartphones partially enabled it to offer better software support. It started with the initial increase from three to five years of support and now from five to seven. </p><p>"After we got a couple more years of Tensor under our belt, and we&apos;re really being able to figure out how to best do those updates," Chau said, "...we got a lot more comfortable saying we can go to that seven years and be able to deliver to our customers that extended time."</p><p>The choice to offer a seven-year promise was no accident, either. Google looked at how long the original Pixel remained in use and found that there were still a significant number of active users until roughly seven years after its initial release. This was the basis for Google&apos;s decision to go with seven years of support. "So if we think about, okay, we want to be able to support Pixel for as long as people are using the device, then seven years is about that right number," said Chau. </p>

<p>The chipset is one of the most complex factors in supporting older devices with new software, according to Chau. However, other reasons Google thinks it can deliver this long of a promise are its continuous lab testing and beta testing thanks to Android&apos;s new Quarterly Platform Releases (QPRs). </p><p>"Now that we have these beta programs year-round, we have much more confidence that we&apos;ll have a reliable update for users on a quarterly basis because we have a lot of beta testers," Chau said. </p><p>Finally, Chau discussed how Google will determine which features are supported on legacy hardware. This has been a hot topic lately since the company originally withheld Gemini Nano from running on the Pixel 8 on-device. It later reversed course and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">plans to bring Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8</a> after further testing. </p><p>The uncertainty was related to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>&apos;s limited amount of RAM, which is why Chau says Pixel feature additions over the years will be rooted in software. Ideally, new features later on won&apos;t require new hardware to work. </p><p>Google&apos;s public comments about the Pixel&apos;s new seven-year update promise give us some insight into the reasoning behind it. However, only time will tell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-android-21-look-like-on-pixel-8">what these Pixel phones will look like in 2030</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bluetooth is 24 years old and it&apos;s come a long way since the days of me carrying a phone, PDA, and MP3 player, wearing a mono single-unit earpiece with a boom that sat along my cheek. Its primary function was making phone calls with my phone (a novel concept today). Much of the progress consumers have experienced comes from manufacturers like Apple finding a good way to slingshot sound from one wireless earbud to another or Qualcomm splitting a stream in a way that allows more than one person to listen at a time. But the meat of it all comes from a group of people known as the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group).</p>
<p>Those are the people who formally announced<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vanilla.tools/new-le-audio-standard-bluetooth-will-enable-audio-sharing-and-more"> <u>Bluetooth LE Audio</u></a> at CES back in 2020. By 2022, the Bluetooth SIG finally completed the list of specifications, fully fleshing out its feature set. Those specs brought with them the potential to deliver some exciting advances to those who use Bluetooth earbuds and headphones. Part of that potential relied on equipment manufacturers&apos; cooperation of course. Today, in 2024, we’re still waiting for that potential to be fully realized. So, where exactly are we? What do we have today, and what&apos;s still to come? Let&apos;s dig into that!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-low-energy"><span>Low Energy</span></h3>
<p>Bluetooth operates on two different radios. The Classic Bluetooth radio uses more power to do things like push higher bitrate streams and extend the range of connected devices while the Low-Energy radio has traditionally been used for slower connections in things like IoT devices.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Low Energy used to mean low-bandwidth. Bluetooth LE Audio changes that, in a meaningful way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>LE Audio changes some of that. Improvements have been made that allow the Low-Energy radio to transmit better-sounding audio at longer distances so the battery in your headphones <em>and</em> the battery in your phone will last longer. There are reports on the web from users who have noted an increase in the battery life of their Bluetooth earbuds when connected to phones that support LE Audio. Remember, whenever we’re talking about Bluetooth technology and codec support, both the sending (your phone) and receiving device (your earbuds) must support the same codec for its features to work.</p>
<p>Despite reports on the web detailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1804kzf/looking_for_earbuds_that_support_lc3_le_audio/">how people are interacting with these technologies</a>, it’s still in its infancy in terms of adoption. The hope is that greater support will bring greater innovations in this space. The Bluetooth SIG says that this means brand new use cases for Bluetooth equipment can be created, so look out for some cool new ideas from companies that make speakers and headphones should LE Audio support become more ubiquitous.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-lc3-codec"><span>The LC3 codec</span></h3>
<p>An audio codec is a piece of equipment or software that can encode or decode (or both) a digital data stream. Bluetooth uses software algorithms that compress and decompress a digital <strong>audio</strong> data stream on the fly to turn a digital saved file into sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD" name="" alt="Bluetooth codec comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD.jpg" mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpfjJk9LgLuqLtsYkoouyD.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of Bluetooth audio codecs. The one most people are familiar with is aptX from Qualcomm, but Bluetooth itself has relied on the SBC (subband codec) to provide "reasonably good audio quality" at a medium bitrate with the bandwidth limitations of Bluetooth in mind. Vendors can use other codecs and audio profiles, but support for SBC is mandatory.</p>
<p>LE Audio comes with the new LC3 codec. It&apos;s a low-power and low-complexity (this means the algorithms used to encode and decode it aren&apos;t going to need a lot of processing power) codec that aims to provide high-quality audio even at low data rates. But two years after finalizing the spec, we still have yet to see the LC3 codec widely supported. Manfred Lutzky, head of audio communications at Fraunhofer IIS had this to say after initially testing it:</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Extensive listening tests have shown that LC3 will provide improvements in audio quality over the SBC codec included with Classic Audio, even at a 50% lower bit rate. Developers will be able to leverage these power savings to create products that can provide longer battery life or, in cases where current battery life is enough, reduce the form factor by using a smaller battery.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Whether or not audio quality is better than SBC at lower bit rates may be up for debate, but the promise of longer battery life has stood up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">true wireless earbuds</a> are cheating. The audio for both ears is sent to one of them, then the channels are separated with the audio destined for the other earbud slung around your head. That&apos;s why even the best true wireless earbuds can get out of sync or stutter from time to time.</p>
<p>That&apos;s some great innovation from hardware manufacturers, but an even better way to do it would be to allow Bluetooth to operate with more than one data stream at a time, and that is exactly what Bluetooth LE Audio can do. It enables transmission of multiple and independent streams that can be synchronized at the source device (think your phone) and sent to one or more sink devices, like headphones or speakers or whatever.</p>
<p>This will also make things like taking a call or using a voice assistant better. Right now, if you&apos;re listening to music through your phone and get a call, the music mutes completely and the same thing happens when you press a button to call Google Assistant or Siri.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Imagine saying Hey Google where is the next gas station without missing the prompt to take the next turn from Maps.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Multi-Stream audio means that music can be quietly playing — or something important like navigation directions can, too — while you screen a call or ask Google where the next gas station is. This is another area where hardware makers can find new ways to make use of Bluetooth LE Audio.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C" name="Bluetooth-Auracast-hero.jpg" alt="Bluetooth Auracast audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What was once known as Audio Sharing, Auracast enables transmission of multiple and independent streams that can be sent out from a source device like one of Samsung’s Neo QLED TVs, then sent to multiple “sink devices,” like their Galaxy Buds2 Pro earbuds. Or exchange that TV for a smartphone, use it as a source, and broadcast audio to a room full of people wearing earbuds or headphones that support Auracast.</p><p>Created with public broadcast in mind, Auracast can do some exciting things beyond just sending audio to multiple sources in your home. An example would be a big screen at the airport playing the news and one or more Bluetooth broadcast channels in multiple languages that everyone can connect to in order to hear it. Or Bluetooth at the movies or a drive-in, which could offer a truly premium audio experience for the blockbuster you&apos;re seeing on the screen. My favorite, is broadcast audio at a museum so that you can easily connect and take a self-guided docent tour.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-hearing-aids"><span>Hearing aids</span></h3>
<p>Bluetooth LE Audio can do a lot of things. And it now can do them on an all-new category of device — a hearing aid.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A codec is what's used to turn a file of data into sound and now your hearing aid can use one, too.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Imagine all the benefits of Bluetooth LE Audio with Auracast and none of them interfering with the primary use of a hearing aid, which is being able to hear the world around you through sound amplification. You could listen to that big screen at the airport or take a phone call and <strong>still</strong> hear the person sitting next to you or a car horn or anything else that&apos;s happening without feeling isolated.</p>
<p>Seeing any new technology that provides safety, entertainment and productivity for people with special needs is wonderful. While this probably won&apos;t be the thing everyone talks about when discussing Bluetooth LE Audio, it may well be the most important thing.</p>

<p>By now you&apos;re probably wondering two things: what products is this in that are actually for sale now, and will my old Bluetooth gear work with my new?</p>
<p>As of March 2024, the list of devices compatible with Bluetooth LE audio isn’t very long. Based on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/experience-immersive-intelligent-sound-with-galaxy-buds-series-latest-updates">press release</a>, Samsung’s phones like the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy S23, Galaxy A54, as well as select older devices will get LE Audio with Auracast broadcast support in One UI 6.1. The Galaxy S24 already supports the standard. Sony’s Xperia 5V supports LE, as well as Google’s Pixel 7, and Pixel 8 series. ASUS Zenfone 10 has been confirmed, but you’ll need a pair of earbuds that also support it to get the full benefit and the choices aren’t many when you look at the multitude of Blueooth-enabled earbuds and headphones on the market.</p><p>You won’t get it with Apple’s earbuds, and some Sony products like the WH-1000XM5 rely on their own LDAC codec instead. But it is out there! Among those confirmed at this time would be the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, Sony’s INZONE gaming buds, WF-1000XM5, and Linkbuds S, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and the Earfun Air Pro 3.</p>
<p>And yes, your existing stuff will still work even if you buy something with these new capabilities. If you get new headphones with Bluetooth LE Audio, they will work with your current phone and vice versa. This is because the Bluetooth SIG <em>does</em> force manufacturers to provide interoperability with legacy equipment in order to be certified. Flex those muscles, SIG.</p>
<p>We&apos;re excited about Bluetooth LE Audio and all that LC3 and Auracast can offer, but with people holding onto phones for years, and manufacturers having to adopt the technologies it could still be a few years until we see if these advancements will have as profound an impact on personal wireless audio devices as we’d like to see.</p>

<p>Sharing files on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> can be tricky, but the task is made easier with the help of Quick Share. Much like Android, Chrome OS requires you to set up and then use the feature. Here&apos;s how you can use Quick Share on your Chromebook.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Chromebook.</p><p>2. Look for Quick Share under <strong>Connected devices</strong>.</p><p>3. Select the <strong>Set up</strong> option beside Quick Share.</p><p>4. Set your device name and visibility preferences.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p><p>7. Pick a file you want to share and tap the <strong>Share button</strong>.</p><p>8. Select <strong>Quick Share</strong> as the method of sharing and send your file.</p>
<p>After setting up Quick Share, you can always disable it from the settings menu and enable it later on.</p>

<p>Windows PCs and Android smartphones have a growing relationship that sees the two operating systems working very cohesively. While apps like Phone Link make it possible to mirror your smartphone and move certain images between devices, Google has made file transfers much easier with the introduction of Quick Share for Windows.</p><p>Here&apos;s how you can use the Quick Share on your Windows PC to enjoy seamless file transfer between compatible devices.</p>
<p>1. Download and install the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/better-together/quick-share-app/"><strong>Quick Share app for Windows</strong></a>.</p><p>2. Open the app and click "<strong>Sign in</strong>." You can also skip the sign-in process if you&apos;d rather not use your Google account.</p><p>3. After signing into your account, return to the app. <strong>Enter</strong> <strong>a name</strong> to easily identify your PC.</p><p>4. Click "<strong>Visible to others as</strong>" to <strong>edit your name and visibility</strong>. You can select from everyone, only contacts, your devices, or no one.</p><p>5. Select a file by right-clicking and choose the Quick Share option to send via this feature.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> was previously a Samsung-exclusive feature. Google only recently decided to merge Nearby Share with Samsung&apos;s feature. Quick Share is not available on all devices that have Nearby Share due to compatibility issues, though, and this poses some big problems.</p><p>For instance, sharing files between a Chromebook and a Windows PC is far more complex if only one of those devices supports Quick Share. Hopefully, Google and Samsung will put their heads together and figure out a way to maintain the seamless beauty of Nearby Share on Quick Share.</p><p>For now, only select Google, Samsung, and OnePlus devices seem to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-rolling-out-quick-share-to-pixel-devices">getting the Quick Share update</a>. Once a wider global rollout is achieved, we hope that sharing files between devices will be even easier than it used to be.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hate wearing smartwatches for sleep tracking</a>, which made the Ultrahuman Ring Air extremely tempting to review. To me, smartwatches are perfectly comfortable during the day but feel oppressive jammed between my sweaty wrist and pillow at night, and the health data becomes unreliable without the perfect fit. A petite smart ring with the same sensors was the solution I didn&apos;t know I needed.</p><p>Launched after a successful Kickstarter last year, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is thicker than your average, non-smart ring but skinnier and longer-lasting than competing smart ring brands. It&apos;s also fairly expensive upfront, but you&apos;ll save money in the long run due to the lack of a subscription.</p><p>Compared to the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> — which does charge a monthly fee for additional features and is heavier — the Ultrahuman Ring Air is a compelling alternative, but also a work in progress, still receiving beta features and app tweaks in response to customer criticism. It also has the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> and rumored Apple Ring to compete with, but those are still down-the-road products.</p><p>How you feel about the Ultrahuman Ring Air will depend on your feelings about smartwatches in general. Smart rings are more accurate in some cases but less accurate or feature-rich in others. A smart ring won&apos;t <em>replace</em> your current smartwatch; the question is whether you want or need one <em>in addition to</em> your watch.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ultrahuman-ring-air-models-price-and-availability"><span>Ultrahuman Ring Air: Models, price, and availability</span></h2>
<p>The Ultrahuman Ring Air launched in September 2023, following the Ultrahuman Ring R1. It comes in four finishes — Aster Black, Matte Grey, Bionic Gold, and Space Silver — and ten ring sizes from 5–14. All ring models cost $349, and they are available on Amazon or the company website. </p><p>Ultrahuman says its ring sizes "differ slightly from standard US ring sizes, and we don&apos;t offer half sizes," recommending that you use its own sizing kit before buying one. If you buy directly from Ultrahuman, you can have a sizing kit shipped for free before you choose a size; otherwise, you can buy the kit on Amazon first for $1. </p><p>Buying directly from Ultrahuman also lets you add an engraving for $39, as well as a protection plan for damage or loss coverage for $2.50/month. Unlike the Oura Ring, there&apos;s no subscription to see all of your ring&apos;s health data. </p><p>The Ring Air comes with a proprietary charger, on which you seat the ring to recharge it in a couple of hours, and a USB-C charging cable (but no charging block).</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ultrahuman-ring-air-specs-and-data"><span>Ultrahuman Ring Air: Specs and data</span></h2>
<p>Before diving into my likes and dislikes, let me run through what data the Ultrahuman Ring Air actually tracks for you — and what it doesn&apos;t track. </p>

<p>Generally, its health sensors measure heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen, and skin temperature — all standard data for smartwatch owners. It also has a built-in accelerometer to track steps. </p><p>Specifically, the Ultrahuman Ring Air focuses on sleep quality. If worn at night, the ring will send data to the Ultrahuman app like your total sleep time, your sleep stages (i.e., REM or deep), your lowest and average heart rates, how quickly your heart rate drops to proper resting levels, how your HRV and skin temperature compare to your baseline, how often you moved around at night, and your overall "restoration" and "efficiency."</p><p>Beyond that, you&apos;ll see a post-sleep Recovery Score, similar to what other fitness brands offer, along with a daily "Movement Index" at the top of the app that essentially tells you if you&apos;re getting enough steps and moving around with enough regularity. </p><p>You can also see a heart rate graph for the day, a guide to when "stimulants" like coffee or excess light won&apos;t affect your sleep quality, your VO2 Max estimate, a timeline of key moments in the day like workouts, and whether you&apos;re hitting daily goals like getting enough sleep or activity. </p><p>As for what you don&apos;t get? Aside from the lack of display, you won&apos;t find any haptics in this ring for vibrating notifications or alarms. It doesn&apos;t have any "Find My" tool if you misplace it. You won&apos;t see any data on irregular heart rhythm (AFib), nor an actual "Stress" metric beyond HRV. And there&apos;s no built-in GPS or gyroscope for tracking workouts. Aside from stress tracking, most smart rings lack these features, however.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-pointing-finger.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air worn on an index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J639EEm5a9rtBGZunsB9uf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve worn the Ultrahuman Ring Air for the past couple of weeks, and with each passing day, I&apos;m less and less aware of its presence. </p><p>At first, I wore it on my dominant hand&apos;s index finger, but I realized this was a mistake. It can get in the way of little things like scraping against a metal fork grip, pulling a game controller trigger, or when (<em>ahem</em>) duty calls. While it occasionally gets in the way on my left hand, it comes up much less often. </p><p>Outside of those rare instances, I don&apos;t notice that I&apos;m wearing the ring for hours at a time — and I&apos;m not someone used to wearing jewelry. Considering I type words for a living, you&apos;d <em>think</em> I&apos;d be more aware of it, but its lightness and soft inner resin coating ensure otherwise.</p><p>As a side-sleeper, I appreciate how it doesn&apos;t press against my skin like a smartwatch does at night. In fact, because it&apos;s well-fitted, it seems to keep a tight seal around my entire finger, which keeps my nightly results consistent. For comparison, I&apos;d find that a smartwatch would press too hard against (or separate from) my wrist, skewing the results. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-finger-on-top-of-pillow.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air on the author's index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, <em>other</em> people see it on my finger in day-to-day life. Its size makes it eye-catching, but the design itself is fairly spartan and uniform. It feels like you&apos;re wearing tech, not jewelry; that may or may not appeal to you. Personally, I find that it matches well with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> for an athletic vibe, but others will find it too boring. </p><p>When I tell people what it is, they inevitably ask if they can try it on. The typical response is surprise at how light it is, so I&apos;m not alone in the feeling.</p><p>Ultrahuman sent me the Space Silver model, which makes a metallic impression but so far seems to withstand any scrapes or grime buildup over time. That said, I think only the Gold and Silver rings would do well in this area, while the Black and Grey rings are more subtle but might be more prone to showing wear and tear.</p>
<h2 id="packed-with-seemingly-accurate-data-2">Packed with (seemingly accurate) data</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-sensors.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air sitting atop a rock, showing the visible sensors on the inner ring." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sGATp9bwGVA6BWGB2DVQaV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned above, the Ultrahuman Ring Air comes packed with sleep data, primarily concerning your heart health and sleep quality. The main focus is on your resting heart rate, HRV for stress and recovery, sleep zones, restlessness, and skin temperature. </p><p>I can only speak to my personal experience, but thus far, my sleep data seems to be quite accurate. It knows when I&apos;ve failed to fall asleep, it continues to track without fail after early-morning bathroom visits, and its recovery score matches my tiredness level. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ThuK3SgwD33umKbkqwdTek" name="ultrahuman-app-stats.jpg" alt="Screenshots of the Ultrahuman app showing the author's sleep index and Recovery Score data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ThuK3SgwD33umKbkqwdTek.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Specifically, my resting heart rate (mid-50s, good for my age) and HRV (high 20s–low 30s, poor for my age) are comparable to my Garmin watch sleep data on the rare times I&apos;ve made myself wear them overnight. Specific Ring Air spot-check readings can be erratic, but my averages are on point; I recommend focusing more on daily or weekly trends than individual readings. </p><p>I&apos;m not going to dive into my specific medical history, but Ultrahuman&apos;s data has given me some actionable data for a worrying health point that was easier to ignore when I skipped wearing a smartwatch at night. For me, that makes it worth the high initial price, as I can now monitor my trends as I work to resolve the issue.</p>
<h2 id="no-subscription-required-2">No subscription required</h2>
<p>While Oura and Fitbit demand a monthly fee before unlocking health reports and the most in-depth information on stress, daily readiness, and so on, Ultrahuman makes this data available for "free" after you&apos;ve bought a ring. </p><p>At any point, you can check your ring&apos;s "weekly insights" on everything from sleep and recovery to steps and average movement from a daily or hourly perspective. It&apos;s easy to ignore the need to move <em>throughout</em> the day instead of just all at once during a workout, but Ultrahuman points out your weak points there. </p><p>I do wish there were separate weekly insight reports for different areas, as my current report seems more fixated on movement than on sleep and recovery. However, since most of the main page data focuses on sleep and recovery, it&apos;s not a major issue.</p>
<h2 id="reliable-battery-life-2">Reliable battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GysMcyq9sbL7Fcwmps6F4J" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-Charger.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air seated on its proprietary charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GysMcyq9sbL7Fcwmps6F4J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman estimates that the Ring Air lasts about 4–6 days per charge. In practice, I&apos;d say 5 days is a pretty reasonable estimate in my experience, with the drain only increasing if you use the Workout mode to track heart rate more frequently. </p><p>For comparison, the Oura Ring Gen 3 lasts 4–7 days, with our reviewer estimating six days in his tests, while other brands like RingConn have a similar estimate. You have to decide if the Oura Ring&apos;s slightly heavier weight is a fair trade-off for an extra day. </p><p>In my opinion, the recharges are spread out enough that they don&apos;t bother me. Smart rings aren&apos;t as essential as a smartwatch in terms of notifications, so I don&apos;t notice the absence as much. I worry about what&apos;ll happen after a year or two when the battery capacity wears down, but that&apos;s a concern for any smart ring.</p><p>Truly, my only complaint is Ultrahuman&apos;s <em>really </em>annoying low-battery notifications, which I&apos;ll discuss later on.</p>

<p>Ultrahuman CEO Mohit Kumar is active on the company&apos;s subreddit, responding to users&apos; complaints and feedback. In one instance, he responded to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrahuman/comments/181xlyc/air_rings_sleep_tracking_is_great_but_heart_rate/?rdt=53983" target="_blank">Reddit complaint</a> about fitness accuracy, noting that the Ultrahuman Ring Air is "optimised for HR and HRV at rest," but that "HR during motion is a work in progress" and to check if the new firmware update provided better results. </p><p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that, in some ways, using the Ultrahuman Ring Air is like being an Early Access gamer on Steam. You&apos;re getting an in-progress experience with regular updates and new features, but some are implemented better than others or tinkered with from one day to the next. </p><p>Specific to fitness tracking, smart rings are meant to be fitted closely to your finger at rest, but during workouts, your fingers will swell from increased blood flow, which can in turn skew your results. Ultrahuman&apos;s algorithm is meant to combat that, but it&apos;ll depend on how well your ring fits. </p><p>I noticed early on during a jog that my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-delivers-absurd-value-for-frugal-serious-runners">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> showed my heart rate at 140 bpm and the Ultrahuman Ring Air had me clocked in the mid-180s. My final averages were pretty close to those numbers, unacceptably far apart. </p><p>For my second run, I swapped my Ring Air to my smaller left index finger to see if it made a difference, and it did! This time, my averages were 144 bpm for Garmin and 153 bpm for Ultrahuman — still off, but less unreasonably so. The same applies to the estimated caloric burn (410 vs. 470). My hope is that Ultrahuman can continue to improve this algorithm over time. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SnuPedWdbZ2L68SDwhJFy7" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-and-Garmin-Forerunner-965.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air and Garmin Forerunner 965 sitting on a pillow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnuPedWdbZ2L68SDwhJFy7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because my heart rate workout data is off, Ultrahuman&apos;s VO2 Max estimate for me (44) is pretty far off from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">Garmin VO2 Max estimate</a> (51). It&apos;ll improve with more running data to offset that terrible first impression, but my main point here is that I wouldn&apos;t use this smart ring — or any smart ring, really — as a <em>primary</em> source for workout data. It&apos;s not designed for it.</p><p>I also find that the Ring Air is more prone to false steps from tapping keys or my hand bouncing on my knee than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> is: I&apos;ll get hundreds of steps and a high movement score while working at my desk. Once out for actual walks, it seems to slightly undercount my steps, which usually balances out the earlier false steps. </p><p>For comparison, my Garmin Forerunner 165 — which beat other fitness brands in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">step-tracking and HR accuracy test</a> — measured 17,446 steps after nine miles of walking and running, while my Ultrahuman Ring Air hit 18,058 steps. Most of the discrepancy comes from those initial false steps, but you still get a decent sense of how active you were that day. </p><p>I only have one "beta" data point that I&apos;m truly suspicious of: the Ultrahuman Ring Air measures blood oxygen levels overnight, but it&apos;s never shown me under 99% and typically shows me at 100%. I&apos;d <em>love</em> for this to be true, but across most of my smartwatch SpO2 tests over the years, I&apos;m typically somewhere between 96–98%. Since Ultrahuman doesn&apos;t show an SpO2 graph like it does for heart rates, I don&apos;t think I can trust this data.</p>
<h2 id="hard-to-find-the-app-data-you-want-2">Hard to find the app data you want</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ismAzFcTvVn5kPCAzkTVf" name="ultrahuman-app-stats-2.jpg" alt="Ultrahuman app screenshots showing VO2 Max, HRV and resting heart rate averages compared to other people the author's age and gender, and a weekly insight report." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ismAzFcTvVn5kPCAzkTVf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman&apos;s app needs work. All of the most useful data is crammed into submenus on the main tab, and it&apos;s not always clear where to find specific data.</p><p>For example, you&apos;ll find how your resting heart rate and HRV scores compare to people your age under VO2 Max, which isn&apos;t very intuitive. Your nightly HR and HRV data are under Sleep Index, but your <em>weekly</em> HRV range is found in the Recovery Score widget. </p><p>I also don&apos;t like how certain graphs default to the last reading it took rather than the daily average. You&apos;ll have to tap away from "Today" to "Daily" to see a more relevant average instead of a recent spot-check. </p><p>All of this data is clumped within the main Home tab. The Ultrahuman app has tabs for Metabolism — which you can only access with its Ultrahuman M1 glucose monitor — a Zones tab for socializing with other ring wearers, and a Discover tab for workouts like yoga and pilates, meditations, bedtime stories, and the Ultrahuman podcast. There&apos;s also a fifth profile tab for changing your settings and checking your weekly insight reports. </p><p>Personally, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d want friends to see how badly I slept — even if they did have Ultrahuman rings, and the Metabolism tab feels like I&apos;m being upsold to buy their monitor. I&apos;d prefer to have customizable tab options if I want to pull up specific information with a single tap instead of scrolling through and tapping the right widgets. </p><p>You can have your data exported to Google Fit, Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Fitbit, Polar, Suunto, Wahoo, MyFitnessPal, and a few other fitness apps if you prefer. </p>
<h2 id="nagging-notifications-2">Nagging notifications</h2>
<p>Unlike smartwatches, smart rings can only communicate through phone notifications. In some ways, this is nice: vibrating watch notifications get tiresome. But in other ways, Ultrahuman needs to chill out.</p><p>It sends several daily notifications about when to enjoy or abstain from "stimulants" like coffee to ensure your sleep isn&apos;t disrupted. Thankfully I could disable these in the app settings, since I don&apos;t drink coffee. You also get regular reminders on when to avoid bright screens for your circadian rhythm — advice I&apos;m not especially good at following, but I appreciate. </p><p>Add in post-sleep summary notifications, movement alerts, praise for moving enough, shout-outs for hitting specific goals, and so on, Ultrahuman has become the most common notification on my smartphone. It&apos;s a bit much!</p><p>The absolute breaking point, though, is when my smart ring falls below 30% battery. At that point, Ultrahuman will buzz me <em>every few hours</em> warning me to recharge, and that&apos;s not an exaggeration. Since that&apos;s enough battery for nearly two days of use, that means two days of pestering! I don&apos;t get the urgency and wish Ultrahuman would only bother me at specific increments (aka 20%, 10%, and 5%).</p><p>I know full well that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">stand alerts are important for bodily health</a>, but in other respects I wish the smart ring were more of a silent companion I could check on at <em>my</em> convenience. </p>

<p>Android Central is new to reviewing smart rings, and the category itself is nascent.

Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-has-huge-potential-but-also-huge-roadblocks">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> should be a major rival to all the current brands later this year. But this early in the game, it&apos;s hard to say which, if any, is the "best" without further testing. </p><p>While I hate wearing wrist-based wearables to bed, anyone without that particular hang-up might have better luck with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">reliable fitness tracker</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>. It costs half as much as the Ultrahuman Ring Air, has the same tracked data, gives you notifications and Google apps, and is relatively lightweight — though still 10X as heavy as a smart ring. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a comfortable wearable for tracking your heart health and sleep quality. </li><li>You want a smart ring that's long-lasting and light enough that you forget it's there.</li><li>Your current smartwatch is too bulky for sleep tracking.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're already happily wearing your smartwatch to bed with no issues.</li><li>You need a <em>primary</em> wearable tracker for fitness data like GPS. </li><li>You want to hold out for a smart ring from another brand, like Samsung.</li></ul>
<p>Smart rings are the next big category, and everyone is scrambling to push out their first model to compete with the Galaxy Ring and the rumored (but likely) Apple Ring. What&apos;s not clear is how excited tech fans and non-tech fans will be for a smart ring.</p><p>Tech-loving folks who sleep with a smartwatch might be tempted to switch to a smart ring, but only if it&apos;s within their own ecosystem, so the data syncs with their current watch data. In the meantime, Ultrahuman does its best to offer a well-rounded app experience and may sync with your favorite app.</p><p>For non-tech fans frustrated with short-lived Apple Watches and faulty Fitbits, the Ultrahuman Ring Air might appeal to them the same way a hybrid watch would, with a subtle design and a decently long-lived battery. That said, the Ring Air&apos;s design is more functional than stylish in my mind.</p><p>I quite like my Ultrahuman Ring Air for its form factor and the bevy of health information it provides, but it has a long way to go before I see it as a fitness device. But since I already have Garmin for that, I don&apos;t necessarily mind that its purpose is so niche.</p>

<ul><li>Google added a section to the landing page for Google Messages that revealed when Apple will support RCS messaging on the iPhone.</li><li>Later, Google pulled the section from that landing page, but the information remains available through screenshots and the Wayback Machine. </li><li>While Apple announced that RCS messaging would come to the iPhone later this year, Google clarified in its promotional material that it will specifically be available in Fall 2024. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google finally won its battle with Apple last year, as the Cupertino-based company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">agreed to support RCS messaging</a> on the iPhone later this year. Now, Google appears to have leaked Apple&apos;s timeline for RCS availability in iOS. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/google-messages/" target="_blank">new landing page for Google Messages</a>, the company shared that Apple "will be adopting RCS in the fall of 2024." Hours later, this landing page has been completely scrubbed of references to this timeline. </p><p>In fact, the entire section that revealed Apple&apos;s plans to support RCS messaging this fall has been removed. In it, Google described RCS messaging by saying, "Hello hi-res, goodbye blur," referencing the improved quality of photos and videos shared over RCS compared to SMS or MMS. Clicking the <strong>See more features</strong> button opened up an expanded spotlight of RCS, where Google outlined Apple&apos;s timeline for supporting the messaging standard.</p><p>Here&apos;s what the section regarding Apple&apos;s upcoming support of RCS on the Google Messages landing page looked like before it was taken down:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="zj32ecHGzr2wxfm8UCESpF" name="Google-RCS-MEssaging-Apple.jpg" alt="RCS messaging promo materials." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zj32ecHGzr2wxfm8UCESpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, that entire section is gone on the very same Google Messages landing page. While the section was only live for a matter of hours, it was partially captured by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328192328/https://www.android.com/google-messages/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. There were originally three main feature spotlights: customization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">photomoji</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>. In the live version of the landing page, only the first two sections remain, with smaller sections for other features that remain below.</p><p>It appears Google may have inadvertently leaked Apple&apos;s timeline, but it isn&apos;t too surprising. Apple&apos;s initial timetable of "later next year," referring to late 2024, seemed to line up with the fall already. Since iOS 18 is set to launch in the fall of 2024, it was already likely that RCS message would be supported starting with that OS upgrade. Now, thanks to Google&apos;s lapse, it seems all but confirmed, although things can change now that the reference was taken down.</p><p>RCS messaging will make texting between iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> easier, leveraging higher-quality photos and videos, read receipts, typing indicators, better group chat support, and more. </p>

<p>We&apos;re long-removed from the days when Chromebooks were basically nothing more than just Chrome on a laptop. While there are still some limitations when compared to Windows or macOS, Google&apos;s ChromeOS development continues to be rather impressive. However, Google is gearing up to bring about the biggest change to the platform since its inception.</p><p>For the past few years, we&apos;ve heard and seen mentions of "Lacros," which stands for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/lacros.md"><strong>L</strong>inux <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>C</strong>h<strong>R</strong>ome <strong>OS</strong></a>." Essentially, it&apos;s just the same Chrome browser that you would use on any other desktop OS. In that vein, Google is working on de-coupling Chrome, the browser, from ChromeOS, the operating system.</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that you will no longer have Chrome on your Chromebook; instead, it will solve a few of the platform&apos;s problems, the biggest of which is the inability to receive browser updates after your Chromebook has reached its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366">AUE date</a>. It&apos;s not important from the standpoint of getting new features, but it <em>is</em> important when it comes to receiving security patches that could compromise your accounts.</p><p>Decoupling Chrome would allow you to download and install updates for the browser for, hopefully, years to come. Doing so would greatly reduce the stigma around Chromebooks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/what-do-i-do-with-an-outdated-chromebook">becoming e-waste</a> after the AUE date is met.</p><p>Google has been working on different ways to reduce the e-waste introduced by Chromebooks. The most recent change came in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-will-receive-updates-10-years">September 2023</a>, when Google announced Chromebooks that have been released since 2019 would receive updates for ten years. This is a definite improvement over the previous eight-year commitment, but Google isn&apos;t done just yet.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-lacros-2">Benefits of Lacros</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-update-page-chromeos-120-beta.jpg" alt="ChromeOS 120 on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5egdsQZmNDt5eQJRw2uEGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If done right, you probably won&apos;t notice a difference between the Chromebook you&apos;re currently using and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> after this update is released. That&apos;s kind of the point of it all and explains why this change has taken so long to implement. However, there are a couple of other benefits to having Lacros compared to the ChromeOS that we have today.</p><p>For one, you&apos;ll no longer need to switch between user accounts just because you have multiple profiles. The same profile switcher that is currently available in Chrome on Windows, macOS, and Linux will now be available on your Chromebook.</p><p>Speaking from experience, this is arguably the biggest reason why I jumped at the chance to enable Lacros as soon as I could. I don&apos;t need to deal with logging out of one account and into another when the Chrome browser already has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-switch-profiles-google-chrome">profile switching</a>. With so many other quality-of-life improvements coming to ChromeOS, this is just one more that adds another feather in the cap for the platform.</p><p>This leads us to another reason why Lacros on ChromeOS is a big deal: we <em>should</em> get a consistent experience across the board. So, any other features that you enjoy when using Chrome on other desktop platforms are likely to make their way to Chromebooks.</p>

<p>It seems like this would be a foregone conclusion, but because of how tightly integrated Chrome is to ChromeOS, it just hasn&apos;t been possible for one reason or another. Thankfully, Lacros will likely "solve" this problem and hopefully avoid any other potential annoyances.</p><p>Circling back to updates, while it&apos;s important to reduce the amount of e-waste, there&apos;s another reason why this eventual split is vital. Currently, both Chrome and ChromeOS receive an update on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-update-chromeos">four-week cadence</a>. However, there are times when an update for ChromeOS is delayed for one reason or another, usually related to a bug that needs to be fixed.</p><p>The problem here is that if there&apos;s a critical security patch that needs to be rolled out, Google can&apos;t do so without updating the entire operating system. Whereas, if you&apos;re using Chrome on Windows, you&apos;ll likely see a "Relaunch to Update" prompt appear in the top right corner of the browser window. With Lacros, Google can push an update to the browser, separate from the OS, and implement any necessary changes immediately.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-catch-2">Is there a catch?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3959px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HuZk7HLEeQU5Hnu6ujhYVB" name="acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-tent-mode.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023) in tent mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HuZk7HLEeQU5Hnu6ujhYVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3959" height="2227" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, you&apos;re probably waiting for me to talk about "the catch," whether it&apos;s a feature that will no longer be present or broken functionality in ChromeOS. Hopefully, since Google has been working on this for so long, there won&apos;t be a "catch" to worry about.</p><p>If all goes according to play, you&apos;ll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-update-chromeos">update your Chromebook</a> one day and you won&apos;t even notice a difference. Unless, of course, you&apos;re like us and read through any changelogs that are made available when updates arrive.</p><p>As it currently stands, you can try making the switch on your own Chromebook, provided that you&apos;re okay with enabling the <strong>#lacros-only</strong> flag. After a restart, the only difference you might see is that the Chrome icon is changed to the same one as the Chrome Canary icon. Other than that, you can just continue using Chrome the same way you always have.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qNvb4LFtWYR2TuoCFwMGPe" name="lacros-browser-chromeos-116-account-switcher.png" alt="Lacros browser account switcher on ChromeOS 116" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qNvb4LFtWYR2TuoCFwMGPe.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that when this does make its way to the stable build of ChromeOS, those who like tinkering with flags will notice a change. Currently, if you want to enable any flags to try new features, you can do so by navigating to "<strong>chrome://flags</strong>." With Lacros enabled, that shortcut is still available but only applies to the browser. So, if you want to mess around with any system-level flags, you&apos;ll navigate to "<strong>os://flags</strong>."</p><p>I wish I were able to sit here and tell you when the change was set to be implemented, but unfortunately, we just don&apos;t know yet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/why-the-lacros-chrome-browser-may-arrive-on-chromebooks-very-soon/">Robby at Chrome Unboxed</a> found that Lacros was the default browser on ChromeOS Canary Version 124, but I&apos;m using Version 125, and it&apos;s back to "normal."</p><p>While it&apos;s highly unlikely to come in the next stable release, we are expecting Google to make the biggest change to ChromeOS at some point in the very near future. But when it does come, you may not even know.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing recently introduced its first budget Android phone, the Phone 2a. The device has been getting nifty new features and improvements since its launch through updates, and a new update is being rolled out this week to further improve the phone.</p><p>The new firmware is dubbed Nothing OS 2.5.4.a, and it includes several bug fixes next to some general improvements. The company says it resolved an issue where the "Hey Google" trigger wasn&apos;t accessible in some situations. It also fixed a bug that occasionally caused the fingerprint sensor to malfunction. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone 2a</a> sometimes created a static noise in the receiver during calls, which also seemed to have been fixed.</p>

<p>Notable improvements also come to the cameras of the Phone 2a, which comprise improvements to Portrait Mode next to enhanced camera saturation and tone. Nothing notes overall improvements to camera performance can be seen after the new update.</p><p>Further, Nothing is bringing optimization to certain charging adaptors that are compatible with the Phone 2a. The connectivity improvements with the update involve enhancements to the stability and compatibility of Bluetooth connections.</p><p>Phone 2a users should definitely check for the update by navigating to their device&apos;s <strong>Settings > System > System Update</strong>.</p>

<p>This week&apos;s latest release is a notable extension to the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1770107652745408560">Nothing OS 2.5.4 update</a>, released a week prior. That update included color accuracy and saturation improvements, next to color consistency optimizations between the primary and ultra-wide cameras of the Phone 2a. </p><p>The update also brought performance improvements to games, including popular titles like BGMI. Furthermore, it also fixed numerous bugs across the apps and interface and optimized the overall stability of the Phone 2a.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a went on sale in early March and turned out to be a great budget pick from the current batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> on the market. It received its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-gets-its-first-update">first update</a> shortly a week after its launch, which introduced new widgets, cameras, and performance improvements.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Nothing going full-on in bringing timely updates to the Phone 2a since its launch (the device had already received three updates), which is worth noting for a budget Android smartphone at this price point.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor suggests Google could look to improve the battery life of the Pixel Watch 3 later this year.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 has reportedly appeared on Safety Korea and Dekra websites for certification, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-3-spotted-dekra-safety-korea-sites-battery-revealed/">91Mobiles</a>. According to the listings, the Pixel Watch 3 has been submitted for certification with a battery bearing model number G1QME. Both databases state it features a 307mAh capacity and is a rechargeable Li-ion battery.</p><p>There was no information listed about its charger or charging speeds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:652px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.02%;"><img id="Ugq9VCKNqdrT2Vg4H9Uhr5" name="pixel-watch-3-dekra-database-battery-listing.jpg" alt="A database listing, assumedly for the Pixel Watch 3, detailing a slight battery improvement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ugq9VCKNqdrT2Vg4H9Uhr5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="652" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91Mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For context, the original Pixel Watch featured a 294mAh battery, which was then boosted to 306mAh with the Pixel Watch 2. Both devices can survive for a single day on a full charge, and that&apos;s even more true when users have AOD (always-on display) enabled.</p><p>Google has consistently improved its smartwatch battery, but the latest leak shows a battery that is nearly identical to last year&apos;s.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the company stated users can expect the Watch 2 to reach 50% charge in thirty minutes, with it maxing out in about an hour. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review#section-google-pixel-watch-2-better-but-not-wireless">review of the device</a> showed that estimation is mostly correct, which helps make up for the device&apos;s short battery lifespan.</p><p>Elsewhere, previous rumors have suggested the Pixel Watch 3 could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-patent-shows-touch-bezel-controls">ditch its rotating crown</a> for a digital bezel. The information stemmed from a patent Google filed in November 2023, showing that users could "slide" or "squeeze" the digital bezels to change what&apos;s happening on their Watch 3.</p><p>The patent&apos;s diagrams included showed that this would help users seamlessly raise or lower their media volume, pause a song, or open notifications.</p><p>Another report speculated that the Pixel Watch 3 could also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">provide a second size</a> — which was one of the series&apos; biggest problems. Rumors suggest the device could arrive later this year with a 45mm size variant to accompany the smaller 41mm device.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini now automatically starts Google Maps navigation when prompted for directions, eliminating the need for manual input.</li><li>The update addresses the inconvenience of having to click on a link for directions manually.</li><li>Gemini offers a quick summary of the route, time, and distance before seamlessly transitioning to Google Maps for navigation.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Gemini just got even handier. Now, when you tell it where you want to go, it automatically fires up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> navigation, so you won&apos;t need to manually start directions.</p><p>Prior to this update, when you used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> for directions, it would give you a quick card with the basics: distance, estimated time, and a map. Plus, there was a handy link for detailed directions. Tapping that would whisk you away to Google Maps for the full route.</p><p>It was a bit of a hassle with Gemini, no doubt. A true hands-free experience shouldn&apos;t require you to tap a link just to get directions.</p><p>But that&apos;s history now with the latest Gemini update on the Play Store, first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/27/gemini-google-maps/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Now, thanks to Google&apos;s tweak, voice commands automatically submit, so you don&apos;t have to bother hitting the "send" button anymore.</p><p>When you say "Navigate to [place]" or "Take me to [x]," Gemini gives you a quick rundown: the route, time, distance, and a map with a "directions" link. Then, after a brief pause, it jumps straight into Maps with your route ready to roll, making things smoother and more hands-free for you.</p>

<p>Gemini does this by using a slew of extensions that connect it to other Google products. According to 9to5Google, Gemini does not need to use the traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to complete tasks; instead, it relies on the Google Maps extension.</p><p>If you&apos;re always on the move and rely on your phone for navigation, you&apos;ll probably love this update. Now, asking for directions means getting on the road in seconds without lifting a finger. It&apos;s a game-changer for saving time, especially when you&apos;re busy hustling around.</p><p>Although Google has been beefing up Gemini&apos;s abilities, it&apos;s still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-fix-these-gemini-flaws-asap">missing a few tricks that Google Assistant has</a>, like <em>Routines </em>and playing music commands. If you opt for Gemini, knowing its strengths will help you make the most of it.</p>
