If that applies to you, Shokz has been at the forefront of those technologies and continues to prove themselves with their latest products.</p><p>"Niche" may be the first word that comes to mind with Shokz&apos;s OpenSwim Pro bone conduction headphones. But after I swam my first lap and took my first sustained underwater plunge wearing the OpenSwim Pro, the next word that came to mind was "impressive."</p><p>By comparison, the affordable OpenFit Air aren&apos;t quite as distinct.

<p>Shokz OpenFit Air is available today, June 5th, in black, white, and pink. You can pick them up for $119.95. OpenSwim Pro is available today in two colors, grey or red, for $179.95. </p><p>With the OpenFit Air, it&apos;s hard to tell how often you&apos;ll be able to pick them up for less than MSRP, though they&apos;ve seen price drops on Amazon almost monthly since December 2023. OpenSwim was on sale bi-monthly, but that may have been an early incentive to purchase due to it having fewer features than the new OpenSwim Pro.</p><p>You can buy both devices directly from Shokz.com or Amazon.com right now. If a trip to the brick-and-mortar is more your speed, they&apos;re available at Best Buy. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-openfit-air-what-i-like"><span>OpenFit Air: What I like</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k9VuohHEmxDSVtaK5f6hna" name="shokz-openfit-air-hero.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9VuohHEmxDSVtaK5f6hna.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s begin with the OpenFit Air. There are a few reasons someone may want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">an open-ear product like this</a>. They could have a few piercings in one or both ears. Maybe they don&apos;t like the feeling of in-ear devices. Then there are the usual use cases you read about: outdoor exercise or a worksite that requires unobstructed hearing. </p><p>Either way, it&apos;s important to note first that the trade-off with having your ear canals unobstructed is the depth of bass you will get. It&apos;s simple physics, and there&apos;s really no way yet to overcome that. Some, like Bose, have come quite close, but you&apos;ll pay almost three times more for those than for the OpenFit Air.</p><p>Speaking of paying more, what differentiates the OpenFit Air from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> besides price? As the name suggests, although their weight difference is negligible, the new Air unit <em>feels</em> lighter than the OpenFit. Shokz took user feedback and moved the battery from the stem portion behind your ear on the OpenFit model to the module over your ear in the OpenFit Air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7SLLWp7W4tgZwQBN8nB2Y" name="shokz-openfit-air-openfit-driver-curve-comparison.jpg" alt="Curve of the driver module: Shokz OpenFit Air versus OpenFit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7SLLWp7W4tgZwQBN8nB2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Curve of the driver module: Shokz OpenFit Air versus OpenFit </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, they added more curves to the entire earbud and the module that houses the 18 x 11mm custom composite dynamic driver unit. The earbud now sits at a 25.5-degree angle while the beveled driver housing sits at 18 degrees, so it fits better in your ear than the OpenFit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vs6kApJfoqbZTdjZcXB3iT" name="shokz-openfit-air-wearing-CU.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air being worn by Tshaka" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vs6kApJfoqbZTdjZcXB3iT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In my testing and comparing the two units, I think this new fit will benefit some and be a negligible difference for others. I like the heavier feel of the OpenFit, and I have terribly small ear canals, so the smaller driver module of the OpenFit works fine for me. That said, the OpenFit Air does feel lighter and just as comfortable to wear for extended periods without feeling like it&apos;s flailing around the outside of your ear as some open earbuds do.</p><p>Sound out of the OpenFit Air has solid clarity in the mids and highs, with good separation in the stereo image. OpenFit Air sounds pretty good as open-ear products go, thanks to the OpenBass Air low-frequency algorithm and Shokz DirectPitch technology, which pushes sound directly into the ear while minimizing leakage. </p><p>The genres that shine brightest with the OpenFit Air tend to be pop, rock, folk, and classical. Hip-hop is fine. You&apos;ll be light on the "Boom" but still get decent "bap." Switching from music to movies, I didn&apos;t experience any latency in dialog, and the bass reproduction was satisfying enough to give action sequences in movies or anime the enjoyable thump they should have. And with movies that feature 5.1 audio, the stereo image these produce is solid.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shokz-openswim-pro-what-wowed-me"><span>Shokz OpenSwim Pro: What wowed me</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5ikAuCTbQDGnLL38J7zgef" name="shokz-openswim-pro-tshaka-swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming laps wearing the OpenSwim Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ikAuCTbQDGnLL38J7zgef.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The previous OpenSwim product escaped my notice. Likely because it was just a standalone MP3 player in the body of a pair of bone-conduction headphones. I don’t swim often, so they weren&apos;t my jam. Shokz may have felt that sentiment from more users than me, so the OpenSwim Pro is no longer a one-trick seahorse. </p><p>You still get the MP3 player with an increased 32GB of storage for MP3, WMA, FLAC, WAV, AAC, M4A, and APE files. That&apos;s more storage than any competing product. Depending on which file types you use, you can cram around 8,000 songs into them — plenty for an Ironman or two. Now, though, you get more utility out of them with the included Bluetooth 5.4 radio so that when you aren&apos;t in the pool, you can stream music, movies, podcasts, or whatever you fancy, right from your phone.</p><p>What&apos;s most interesting about these headphones is their underwater sound quality. It is seriously impressive. I&apos;d almost say that they sound better underwater! Imagine that. This underwater awesome is achieved by OpenSwim Pro having triple-sealed components rated for IP68 dust and water ingress which means you&apos;re good up to (two meters) six feet deep for up to two hours. That&apos;s the first part. </p><p>Once you&apos;re in the pool, you can switch the headphones to MP3 mode and choose the Swimming EQ preset (you also have a Standard EQ preset). The Swimming preset flattens the sound profile, sounding tinny out of the water and killing bass response but giving you an underwater listening experience that is highly impressive. The bass magically reappears, giving you a delightfully robust sound as you hit those freestyle strokes or do some underwater laps.</p><p>Just don&apos;t pass six feet of depth, since it could damage the OpenSwim Pro. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GwCjWjaautiXEMNyyPKTUe" name="shokz-openswim-pro-volume-power-buttons.jpg" alt="OpenSwim Pro volume/power buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GwCjWjaautiXEMNyyPKTUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">OpenSwim Pro volume/power buttons also switch modes. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part of this swimming tech is that you don&apos;t need the app to access it. You can simultaneously press the volume down and volume up/power buttons to switch the OpenSwim Pro from Bluetooth to MP3 mode. The controls — the large multifunction button on the front and those volume buttons underneath the right arm of the headband — are just as responsive wet as they are dry. </p><p>Below those volume buttons is the proprietary four-pin magnetic charging port. To keep everything sealed and protected against water ingress, you&apos;ll use pogo pins instead of USB-C.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6bpwdXWPSKCSmAPNK5EDTW" name="shokz-openswim-pro-case.jpg" alt="OpenSwim Pro case drainage holes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6bpwdXWPSKCSmAPNK5EDTW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fine folks at Shokz also considered the case when it comes to getting wet. It&apos;s wedge-shaped so it can stand up and has drainage holes on the back to accommodate airflow for damp headphones drying. Being upright ensures those drainage holes don&apos;t get blocked.</p><p>Overall, on land, the audio quality from the OpenSwim Pro is really good, with a caveat I&apos;ll get to in a moment. They have excellent sound separation in MP3 mode and Bluetooth mode. You have to remember that you&apos;re using open-ear audio devices, so there&apos;s a level of warmth from the mids and lows that you aren&apos;t going to get like in-ears, but despite that, the audio output is pleasing. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shokz-openswim-pro-openfit-air-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Shokz OpenSwim Pro, OpenFit Air: What could use improvement</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynefCuDQFNGvYJZu8g5fdS" name="shokz-openswim-pro-wearing-CU2.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air, and OpenSwim Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynefCuDQFNGvYJZu8g5fdS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much I take issue with regarding both of these devices, but for the OpenSwim Pro, the bass passed through the bone conduction pads may get annoying for some people and too much for those who are ticklish. It vibrates a lot! Like "PS5 gaming remote haptic feedback" a lot. I think this is a feature that some people will accept but others will hate.</p><p>Sorry to be a wet blanket, triathletes, but I have to mention the inability to use these earbuds in salt water. So, no ocean use for you. If you do happen to purchase the OpenSwim Pros and try them in that deep blue sea, Shokz recommends that you wash them off with fresh water and dry them immediately.</p><p>One other thing I&apos;d like to see on future OpenSwim Pro units is the ability to adjust the neck, or is it a head-band? For me it sits at the base of my skull, so technically, I guess that makes it a headband.</p><p>Despite the new angled design, the OpenFit Air feels "loose," hovering over my ear. For my ear geometry, the OpenFit feels like it sits closer to my ear, but ears are like fingerprints; no two are the same, so your mileage will vary in how they feel on you. </p><p>The last thing you may have an issue with is the case size. It&apos;s a hair larger than the previously released OpenFit, so it is "purse-able," but pocketable? Not really. It&apos;s going to leave quite the imprint sitting in your pockets.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-competition"><span>Competition</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xa4j3qWGqRTonczB4GPA6L" name="PXL_20231218_004811600.jpg" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit and AeroFit Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xa4j3qWGqRTonczB4GPA6L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If swimming gear is what you&apos;re looking for, there are actually a few other options on the market, and we have an entire roundup of open-ear earbuds to consider if it&apos;s the OpenFit Air you were curious about. First, let&apos;s talk OpenSwim Pro competitors. The H20 Audio Tri Multi-Sport has a nice, warm bass-heavy sound but, unlike the OpenSwim, only has 8GB of storage for music. They&apos;re $20 less but are only rated for water ingress, not dust, and their controls can be finicky. </p><p>The Zygo Solo takes a novel approach to keeping you in the water and entertained by using an FM radio transmitter, which does a lot better than Bluetooth underwater. The downside is that compared to the OpenSwim Pro&apos;s nine hours of battery life, you&apos;ll get just three hours. Oh, and they&apos;re a lot bigger than the OpenSwim Pro. </p><p>There are a couple of others, but they lack either the battery life, the storage capacity, or the sound quality of the OpenSwim Pro.</p><p>For OpenFit Air competition, the premium upgrade that gives you upgraded sound, a jaw-dropping "Immersive Sound" mode, and better battery life if you don&apos;t use that immersive mode is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds.</a> These are almost three times the cost, though. You&apos;ll pay $299 ordering them from Amazon. </p><p>1MORE Fit Open Earbuds S50 have a long name and an even longer battery life: 11 hours. They&apos;re IPX7, so no dust ingress rating, and they&apos;ll cost you $10 more. People with smaller ears may experience fit issues with these. </p><p>Anker also offers some competition in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-aerofit-review">Soundcore AeroFit Pro</a>, which gives you an impressive 14 hours of playback time and supports LDAC playback. They come with a detachable neckband to shore up the fit for those high-intensity workouts and they sound great at lower volumes.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shokz-openswim-pro-openfit-air-should-you-buy-them"><span>Shokz OpenSwim Pro, OpenFit Air: Should you buy them?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5egggJaMpui5JcesC5Bef9" name="shokz-openswim-pro-openfit-group.jpg" alt="Shokz OpenFit Air and OpenSwim Pro group photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5egggJaMpui5JcesC5Bef9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy OpenFit Air if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want relatively inexpensive open-ear earbuds</li><li>You have concha piercings and in-ears don't fit</li><li>You want open-air earbuds that sound good</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy OpenFit Air if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are a bass lover</li><li>You need more than 6 hours of battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should buy OpenSwim Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You spend a lot of time in the water</li><li>You want something with great sound submerged</li><li>You want something for surf and turf</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy OpenSwim Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're very ticklish. Seriously.</li><li>You don't like neckband configurations</li><li>You need earbuds that can withstand salt water</li></ul>
<p>If you want a product that will "Wow!" you underwater, the OpenSwim Pro is that product. It has nine hours of battery life (six hours in MP3 mode), is IP68 rated for two hours in the pool at up to six feet deep, and has an MP3 mode with 32GB of storage, making it a hard product to beat in this category. Best of all, Bluetooth 5.4 makes it… not so niche. Despite the potentially ear-tickling bone conduction modules, the OpenSwim Pro is easily recommended for the mermaids and mermen among us (Mer-persons?).</p><p>OpenFit Air has stiff competition in the open-ear market. Still, its light weight, solid sound, IP54 rating, wallet-friendly price point, and good call quality make it a good all-around open-ear earbud for those who need or prefer this design.</p>

I turned to the DiskStation DS1823xs+, and slotted in four 18TB HAT5310 drives alongside an assortment of Seagate Exos and IronWolf drives I&apos;m testing long-term, bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">total storage to 114TB</a>.</p><p>The addition of Seagate&apos;s excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">Exos X24 24TB drive</a> increased the addressable storage to 138TB, and for once, I&apos;m actually ahead of my storage requirements — I don&apos;t see myself filling these drives for at least another year or so. That timing works out well, because in that time, we should start seeing retail availability of Seagate&apos;s next-gen Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) drives.</p>

<p>Most HDDs in the market today use Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) or Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR), and if you&apos;re buying anything that&apos;s 8TB or above, there&apos;s a good chance that it uses CMR. With ever-increasing storage needs, hard drive manufacturers are figuring out ways to maximize data density on a platter; the 24TB Exos X24 uses 10 platters, with each platter able to hold 2.4TB of data.</p><p>When writing data to a CMR drive, the magnetic tracks are arranged side-by-side, so changing data on one track doesn&apos;t affect neighboring tracks. SMR drives, meanwhile, maximize density by overlapping tracks, and this makes the drives more affordable, but affect read/write transfers to a noticeable degree. While high-density SMR drives are used in data centers, they&apos;re not ideal for home use scenarios involving plenty of read/write workloads.</p><p>With HAMR drives, we&apos;re seeing the introduction of 30TB HDDs. That&apos;s a sizeable achievement, and Seagate is already selling a 30TB drive called the Exos Mozaic 3+, albeit to enterprise customers. The drive is built on the Mozaic 3+ platform, and it utilizes a 10-platter design — just like the Exos X24 — but with each platter now containing 3TB of data.</p><p>When storing that much data on a single platter, the individual bits are so tightly packed together that changing one bit has the potential to alter nearby bits. HAMR tech counters this by a novel method: lasers. HAMR drives use a plasmonic metal antenna (a diode laser) that&apos;s attached to each write head, and the laser heats a minuscule section of the disk platter at a time, allowing the write head to change the polarity of the bit — but not others around it. This process takes a nanosecond, and doesn&apos;t otherwise affect the thermal stability of the drive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="caEnShWMMUBoiuazTwynKo" name="seagate-exos-x24-10.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/caEnShWMMUBoiuazTwynKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the way the tech works, only the data in the area targeted by the laser diode is altered, and once it cools, it regains its magnetic coercivity. To achieve this, Seagate is using custom hard drive platters that consist of an iron-platinum alloy and a glass substrate, and as the material has higher coercivity, it is thermally stable until it comes into contact with the laser.</p><p>All of this basically means that we can now get drives with significantly higher areal density, leading to HDDs going up to 70TB and beyond. That&apos;s still some way out, but with Seagate now selling 30TB and 32TB drives based on the Mozaic 3+ platform to data center customers, we don&apos;t need to wait too long before these drives are available to retail buyers.</p><p>There&apos;s the small matter that even if Seagate rolled out 30TB drives to consumers today, there aren&apos;t many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">home NAS servers</a> that can accommodate the drives. Most enclosures go up to 24TB, and it&apos;s going to be a year or two until we start seeing NAS servers that can slot in 30TB and higher-storage drives.</p><p>Even though if you don&apos;t need (or want) 30TB drives, their introduction will reduce prices of current 20TB and 24TB drives, and that&apos;s always welcome. The 24TB Exos X24 is already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/seagate-exos-x24-st24000nm002h-24tb/p/N82E16822185105">decent bargain at $479</a> considering the amount of storage on offer, but the introduction of higher-density should bring down those figures. I can&apos;t wait.</p>

<ul><li>It appears that Google's repair policy allows it to retain Pixel devices containing unauthorized parts.</li><li>Similar practices by Samsung suggest a potential industry trend limiting independent repair options.</li><li>Google's policy also discards accessories sent in with Pixels for repair.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery by a YouTuber highlights Google&apos;s sneaky repair policy meant to confiscate your Pixel if it&apos;s got parts the company didn&apos;t approve.</p><p>A recent discovery by YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n4y9mrep9Y" target="_blank">Louis Rossmann</a>, reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keeps-phones-with-non-oem-parts-3448350/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, revealed a potential point of contention within Google&apos;s service policy. The policy, effective since July 19 of last year, grants Google the right to retain Pixel devices sent in for repair if unauthorized components are discovered. This raises questions regarding consumer choice and repairability within the tech industry.</p><p>The specific clause, as found on Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">website</a>, states: "You will not send in a Device containing non-Google-authorized parts – if You do, Your Device will not be returned to you."</p><p>A key caveat within Google&apos;s repair policy pertains to the use of non-authorized components. Individuals who choose to use aftermarket parts for Pixel repairs should be aware that Google reserves the right to retain the device should it be sent in for subsequent repairs containing such parts.</p><p>This policy creates a bit of a clash between your right to fix your own stuff and Google wanting to keep things under their control.</p><p>The recent discovery of Google&apos;s anti-consumer repair policy echoes a similar controversy that surfaced around two weeks ago. Leaked Samsung service contracts revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-samsung-contract-user-data-device-disassembly">protocol mandating repair technicians to immediately dismantle and report devices containing non-OEM parts</a>.</p><p>This recurring trend suggests a potential industry-wide practice, raising concerns about consumer choice and restrictions on independent repair options within the mobile tech sector.</p><p>But that&apos;s not all. The document supposedly spilled the tea on a practice that might be a privacy nightmare. Apparently, Samsung wanted repair shops to hand over a ton of customer data in exchange for genuine parts. We&apos;re talking names, phone numbers, IMEI details, and all the juicy details about why the phone needed fixing in the first place.</p><p>Google&apos;s repair policy extends beyond component scrutiny. Any accessories, like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-pixel-8-cases">favorite Pixel 8 cases</a>, adorning your Pixel during its repair journey will likely be relegated to the lost and found bin, assuming your phone even passes the "authorized parts" inspection.</p><p>This throws some shade on Google&apos;s repair practices. The company wasn&apos;t exactly known for sunshine and rainbows before when it came to fixing Pixels, and now this policy adds another layer of frustration.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>Following concerns raised over its anti-consumer repair policy, Google revised its service policy. The company says it will not retain phones for repair due to non-OEM parts.</p><p>"If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether the phone has non-OEM parts or not," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. "In certain situations, we won&apos;t be able to complete a repair such as if there are safety concerns. In that case, we will either send the phone back to the customer or work with them to determine next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this."</p>

All he could recall was the tune “hmm, hmm, hiiiim.” While the ability to search for a tune with such vague recollection of the lyrics or rhythm might not yet be on the horizon, you can, in fact, sing or hum a part of a song on YouTube to hopefully locate it.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-song-identification-search-android">new song identification feature</a> works similarly to one that Google already offers in its own app and on Pixel mobile devices. But now, it’s extended to YouTube as well.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-search-for-a-song-on-youtube-by-singing-or-humming-2">How to search for a song on YouTube by singing or humming</h2>
<p>If you want to get a detailed list of results that pertain to a song, band, or artist, you can search for the tune right in the YouTube app.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube app</strong> on your Android mobile device.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Search icon</strong> (magnifying glass) at the top, right.</p><p>3. A pop-up may appear asking you to <strong>Allow YouTube to record audio</strong>. Choose <strong>While using the app</strong> or <strong>Only this time</strong>. (Note: if you choose Only this time, you will have to adjust settings for the app to use this feature again).</p>

<p>4. Select the <strong>Song tab</strong> at the top.</p><p>5. The results will pop up after a few seconds of humming, singing, or playing a tune. You may see something like related videos, links to the music video for the song, and any other related content, including covers, viral videos, and more.</p>

<p>If you want to get a more specific result that just shows the song and gives you the option to play or save it, use YouTube Music.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube Music app</strong> on your Android mobile device.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Search icon</strong> (magnifying glass) at the top, right.</p><p>3. Beside the tiny microphone icon to the right of the search bar, you should also see a little <strong>wavelength symbol.</strong> Select that.</p><p>4.

<p>Provided you have given enough information, ths method to search for a song on YouTube and YouTube Music should work. I tried it multiple times and it was pretty good at identifying tracks both old and new. With YouTube, you can explore a video of the song itself as well as tons of other related content, from covers to interviews with the band, and more. With YouTube Music, you can easily add songs to your playlist. But it isn’t foolproof.</p><p>With YouTube Music, for example, I once got a different version of a track from the one I wanted, but close enough. Another time, it called up a cover of a song versus the actual one. A few times, my 12-year-old son tried, albeit with some more obscure and difficult-to-identify tracks, and it chose the wrong ones.</p><p>Nonetheless, the feature is fun to use. And if you hold up your phone to the actual track that&apos;s playing versus attempting your best Billy Eilish or Ed Sheeran impersonation, the app will almost certainly be able to identify it.</p><p>Note that you can already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-assistant-identify-songs">use Google Assistant to identify songs</a> as well. But this handy new feature further solidifies YouTube Music’s position as one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-music-players-android">the best music player apps for Android</a>.</p>

<p>This battery pack can uniquely be worn around the waist or crossbody over your shoulder, which helps redirect weight from your head or neck so you can move more freely while playing. The 10,000 mAh battery capacity means it can extend the VR experience anywhere from an extra 4 up to 9 hours. Plus, it can be used for other devices beyond just VR headsets. </p></p>

<p>If you're still rocking the Quest 2 and looking for an affordable way to extend battery life, this battery pack gives you a reasonable extra 2-4 hours of playtime via its 5,000 mAh battery. But it also has a useful IR light built in to help enhance gameplay in the dark. With adjustable brightness, your late-night or backyard game sessions will be better (and brighter) than ever. </p></p>

<p>Closing out our list, we'll focus more on Quest 3 battery <em>straps</em> instead of battery packs. The Kiwi Design strap doesn't let you swap in a new pack, but you still get 6,400mAh of extra battery capacity, good enough to double your Quest 3's meager 2-hour lifespan. Comfortable, balanced, and easily secured to your head size, the Kiwi Design strap is a great all-in-one option. </p></p>

<p>Another Quest 3 battery strap to consider, this Saqico model gives you an impressive 10,000mAh of battery capacity packed directly into the Elite-style strap with a knob for a secure fit and a hinge to help you find a comfortable angle. Like many battery straps, it's on the heavy side, but the extra security and play length make this a reasonable trade-off. </p></p>

<h2 id="alternative-power-bank-options-2">Alternative power bank options</h2>
<p>When using a VR headset, it&apos;s best to use bespoke hardware. You&apos;ll get comfort enhancements and play like it was meant to be played. You can also use a regular old USB power bank but, keep in mind that having a battery in your pocket and a long cable running up to your headset can be awkward. Still, we&apos;d love to recommend a few low-fi Quest power bank options to get you going.</p>

<p>KIWI Design makes a simple little product that attaches any battery pack you might already own below to your headset via adjustable velcro straps. This pack comes with that velcro strap, a small USB cable to connect your battery pack to the Quest 2, and a small adjustable zip tie to keep it in place. If you're planning to use a regular USB power bank and don't want it in your pocket, this is a pretty good alternative.</p></p>

<h2 id="what-features-to-consider-when-buying-a-meta-quest-battery-pack-2">What features to consider when buying a Meta Quest battery pack</h2>
<p>The most important thing when choosing an external battery pack for the Meta Quest 3 or Oculus Quest 2 is that it should support at least 9V 2A (18W) for optimal performance. There are many batteries on the market with those stats, but there are many other things to consider, such as size and how long they will hold a charge. Still, connecting a battery pack can extend your gaming sessions in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-games">best Quest 3 & 2 games</a> without needing to seek out a wall charger every time you take a break.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-is-the-one-quest-3-accessory-you-actually-need">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> for the Meta Quest 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/geekvr-q2-pro-vs-bobovr-m2-pro">BoboVR M2 Pro</a> for the Quest 2 are the best way to add comfort to your play sessions and keep them going for longer with the ingenious magnetically detachable, hot-swappable and rechargeable battery packs. It&apos;s the most foolproof way to get longer battery life and not have to worry about a cord getting in the way.</p><p>Any of these power banks will let you stay in VR longer. Depending on your needs, some banks may be more suitable than others. Go with the largest battery capacity you can afford to get the most out of the extra charging abilities.</p>

You can tag your run with "#GlobalRunningDay" on your social media app of choice and probably get some love from fellow runners. Simple!</p><p>For those motivated by challenging other runners, rewards, medals, or other swag, we&apos;re here to help. You can find plenty of organizations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> that treat Global Running Day as a serious event.</p><p>Here&apos;s how we recommend getting the most out of Global Running Day 2024!</p>
<h2 id="run-or-walk-a-virtual-5k-2">Run (or walk) a virtual 5K</h2>

<p>New York Road Runners (NYRR) conducts the "official" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nyrr.org/Races/VirtualNYRRGlobalRunningDay5K" target="_blank"><strong>Global Running Day 5K event</strong></a>. At that link, you can register for the event — it&apos;s free so long as you don&apos;t want to pay for a Brooklyn Half Marathon entry — and sync your Strava account. </p><p>Once you&apos;re registered, you have until June 9 to run a 5K and upload it to Strava; your name and result automatically appear on the leaderboard and will climb the ranks if you upload a faster 5K in the contest window. Now you can compare your best effort against runners around the world, which is some awesome motivation!</p><p>Another major aspect of this event is fostering a love of running in children. You can also find a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth/active-at-home/virtual-challenges/global-running-day" target="_blank"><strong>Virtual Rising NYRR Global Running Day Kids Run</strong></a> that encourages you to "pledge" to run or walk a mile with your kid between now and the end of June. Then you can print out a bib for your child to wear and a finisher certificate for them to hang afterwards, to reward them for working hard.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-local-running-club-or-event-2">Find a local running club or event</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can&apos;t list out every local running event out there, but plenty of organizations use Global Running Day as a pretense to gather for social running. They&apos;re typically open to newcomers and will run at a reasonable, matching pace. </p><p>Check social event sites like Eventbrite or Meetup, or look at local Clubs in Strava, where they might list Global Running Day meetups. Then do a quick search for local running, sports, or shoe retail locations in your area; they often have running clubs that meet regularly at that storefront. Even if they don&apos;t, the store&apos;s workers may have scuttlebutt on local running events you may not know about!</p><p>Otherwise, I recommend simply Googling "Global Running Day [your city name]" and seeing what comes up. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re more of a solitary runner, you may still get a rush of endorphins when your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> or app gives you a reward for hitting certain fitness goals. If so, you may be interested to know that some brands specifically reward you for working out on Global Running Day.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> owners who run at least 5K on Wednesday will get that limited-edition award in the photo above, for you to look at in your Apple Fitness award shelf. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners will get a limited-time "Global Running Day 2024 badge" simply by recording any running activity on June 5. It&apos;s not a "Challenge," so you don&apos;t need to opt into anything to get the badge.</p><p>I didn&apos;t find any other specific badges related to Global Running Day aside from the aforementioned Strava NYRR challenge badge. But you can still look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/my-favorite-running-and-walking-apps-for-motivation">motivational running or walking apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walkthedistance&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank"><strong>Walk the Distance</strong></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-hike/id1557127861" target="_blank"><strong>Fantasy Hike</strong></a><strong> </strong>that convert your steps into progress towards a goal, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-zombies-run-marvel-move-helped-me-hit-personal-best">Zombies, Run! missions</a> that will turn your 5K run into a life-threatening race against zombie foes that feels more meaningful.</p>

<p>Everyone worries about making New Year&apos;s resolutions, but starting fitness goals in the middle of summer when nights are long and warm makes more sense. You can <em>start</em> a fitness renaissance on Global Running Day, and then try to keep up your momentum after work ends.</p><p>One simple goal almost anyone can accomplish (with dedication) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walking 10,000 steps a day for a month</a>, as I did last summer. You can make your personal goal 6,000 or 8,000 steps; the number is mostly arbitrary, according to doctors, so long as you&apos;re generally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">moving and standing during the day</a>. But walking consistently is the starting point for being able to <em>run</em> more consistently. </p><p>Another goal is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve your VO2 Max</a>, or your body&apos;s ability to convert as much oxygen into energy as possible during exercise. Most fitness watches estimate your VO2 Max or "cardio fitness level" based on your activities, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-love-polars-manual-vo2-max-and-recovery-tests">Polar lets you test your VO2 Max</a> directly. </p><p>Regardless, improving this stat encourages you to make your runs more purposeful. Max-effort intervals, hill training, or sprints can all help you improve, but you&apos;ll also want to mix in low-aerobic activities at about 55–75% of your max heart rate, to improve your body&apos;s ability to move without immediately overworking your heart. Watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> can help guide you on the right training to steadily improve.</p>
<hr>
<p>If this is all getting a bit overwhelming, just remember this: Global Running Day 2024 isn&apos;t meant to be a gatekeeping event for runners, but rather a way to inspire anyone and everyone to join in on the experience. If you want to treat this as a one-off workout and leave it at that, then that&apos;s totally okay.</p><p>Now, get out there on the nearest trail, track, or treadmill and enjoy the day!</p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out Android 15 Beta 2.2 to enrolled Pixel users.</li><li>The patch aims to solve some persistent problems users still reported involving "Private Spaces" alongside some issues with NFC.</li><li>The company quickly pushed Beta 2.1 to users in May following severe issues with Private Spaces.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to push another "minor" update for Android 15 Beta 2, which seeks to fix problems caused by the beta&apos;s initial rollout.</p><p>The company detailed the contents of the Beta 2.2 patch in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1d7cjx4/android_15_beta_22_now_available/">post on Reddit</a>. According to the notes, enrolled Pixel owners should begin receiving an OTA (over-the-air) patch labeled as version AP31.240426.023.B4. This update will apply to those with devices ranging from the Pixel 6 up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, and 8a.</p><p>The Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet are also getting in on this minor patch. The download size for the Pixel 8 Pro has been reported to be 55.78MB. However, another user reported a 2.57GB download. </p><p>Google explains that Beta 2.2 continues to focus on the lingering problems users have faced with "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a>." The patch solves an issue where "creating a private space on a device for the first time removed app icons from the Home screen."</p><p>Additionally, there are a couple of crucial fixes for Pixel devices&apos; NFC capabilities. The patch explains that a fix for the "Wallet role" that previously a device&apos;s NFC feature from functioning should be solved. NFC payments that failed to progress should also be fixed with the Beta 2.2 patch.</p><p>The remainder of the fixes, as detailed in the full changelog, are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where the app drawer didn't open when swiping up.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused videos that were recorded using 10-bit HDR to have a green tint.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, interactivity, and connectivity.</li><li>Fixed issues that sometimes caused mobile data connections to drop, even when the device was receiving a strong cellular signal.</li></ul>

<p>With Google continuing to fix problematic issues, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1d7cjx4/comment/l6ykqkk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user on Reddit</a> stated that the share sheet bug persists despite the patch. It seems as though the bug was marked "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/340936670">closed</a>," per another user&apos;s comment, but the fix hasn&apos;t been implemented.</p><p>As usual, Google states that enrolled testers should give their devices around 24 hours before picking up the OTA update. Users can check manually by hopping into their <strong>Settings > System > System updates </strong>to check and begin downloading/installing.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-android-15-beta-21-in-haste-following-user-woes">rolled out Beta 2.1</a> for Android 15 quickly in May following severe problems with Private Spaces. Users reported that after interacting with the feature and assigning apps to its secluded space, they found that Private Spaces deleted icons from their home screens. Beta 2.1 pushed hurriedly to users to fix those problems and we&apos;re seeing with its 2.2 patch that some lingering issues were still around.</p>

<ul><li>The latest system update brings a new "Full PWM" option to the Vivo X100 family.</li><li>This new setting enables 2160Hz PWM at all brightness levels, an improvement over the previous 360Hz.</li><li>Full PWM is the latest candidate for a more eye-friendly, flicker-free way of dimming OLED displays.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Vivo just unleashed its latest weapon to combat eye strain for folks who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitive</a>, and it&apos;s something many users have been asking about for a long time. The latest June update for the Vivo X100 series of phones introduces a new "Full PWM" option in developer settings, supercharging the PWM rate from 360Hz to a rather eye-friendly 2160Hz.</p><p>This update is surprising because Vivo is introducing a major new feature half a year after debuting the X100 series instead of reserving this kind of feature for a new phone release. If you have a Vivo X100 series phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/community-guide/273205728/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-android-pixels-6-secret-android-tips?hl=en">enable developer options</a>, then find the "Full PWM" option inside developer options to test it out.</p><p>Previously, the 2160Hz frequency wouldn&apos;t kick in until the phone reached low brightness, which meant some PWM-sensitive users had difficulty using it at high brightness levels. Enabling Full PWM mode ensures that this rate stays consistent at 2160Hz, a number verified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/comments/1d6eonz/vivo_x100_pro_new_full_pwm_mode_measured_with/">by one Reddit user</a> using an Opple Light Master light meter, the same meter I use for phone reviews on Android Central.</p><p>One reviewer, linked in the video below, shows how the perceived pulse rate has been notably lowered with the new update, keeping it under the magic 15% number that often causes eye strain.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pbp7WkQjo6Y?start=494" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Our own Harish Jonnalagadda tested his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro review</a> unit and confirmed the numbers, showing that Vivo&apos;s new update provides not only a high PWM rate but also a sine-shaped waveform. Typically, a sine wave shape has smoother transitions between on and off and is more comfortable for users as it more closely mimics an incandescent bulb.</p><p>As a quick refresher, PWM dimming is a method display manufacturers use to lower or raise the perceived brightness of certain types of displays. This method flashes the screen on and off rapidly, often hundreds or thousands of times per second, tricking our eyes into thinking the display is brighter or dimmer depending on how long the display stays off during these periods of flashing.</p><p>OLEDs most often use PWM dimming and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">some users like myself</a> have been negatively affected by this dimming tactic, getting headaches, eye aches, and even nausea when the flickering frequency is too low. A higher flickering frequency generally lowers the potential for these negative affects.</p>

<ul><li>Strings in Google's app point toward the possibility of an upcoming Spotify extension for Gemini.</li><li>The discovery highlighted two strings: a message informing users that their content is starting and another prompting them to "sign in."</li><li>YouTube Music recently picked up its Gemini extension, providing users with a host of prompts for Gemini to begin playing their custom playlists or radios.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A discovery in Google&apos;s app seemingly points toward the company working on another music-related extension for Gemini.</p><p>As spotted in version 15.22.2 of the Google app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-google-gemini-extension-coming-soon-apk-teardown-3448585/">Android Authority</a>, a Spotify extension for Gemini might be on the way. The availability of a Spotify extension would (ideally) let users quickly access their created playlists and discover songs, genres, artists, and more.</p><p>The app&apos;s code isn&apos;t extensive, as the dive only uncovered a couple of strings. Firstly, it looks like Gemini will alert users that it&apos;s beginning their play session as the string reads "Starting to play on Spotify." This could be the message users see after telling the AI to play a certain song or playlist.</p><p>Following that is a string that states "Spotify requires sign-in." A requirement like this isn&apos;t anything strange as all of Google&apos;s extensions require the user&apos;s account before proceeding.</p><p>Aside from the light discovery, there wasn&apos;t anything else in the Google app&apos;s code to give us more to work with. There&apos;s hope that the Spotify extension will work on the web and the Android variant of Gemini, but we&apos;ll have to wait a while before knowing.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, YouTube Music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">picked up a Gemini extension</a> for its web app and on Android. Google highlighted on its support page that users will have access to an array of prompts for the bot for different actions. Users can tell Gemini to find a specific song by a particular artist or start a radio station for a specific genre.</p><p>After signing in, your entire YouTube Music library of custom playlists becomes accessible, and you can prompt Gemini to play one.</p><p>In other news, Spotify <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotifys-price-hikes-and-lack-of-hifi-make-me-want-to-own-music-again">recently detailed</a> a price hike users should prepare for. Beginning in July, consumers who&apos;ve purchased the Individual Plan will see the price rise by a dollar from $10.99 to $11.99. Moreover, those with Spotify Premium Duo and Spotify Premium Family will experience a sharper increase.</p><p>The former will rise by $2 to $16.99, while the former is set to jump by $3 to $19.99.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s AI chatbot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> has been encountering issues as users begin reporting strange instances of gibberish.</p><p>A user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1d7lw4u/i_think_i_broke_it/">on Reddit</a> posted a screenshot of a response from Gemini, which was full of jumbled pieces of code and characters from other languages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/04/google-gemini-gibberish-repeating-word-replies/">9to5Google</a>). In the user&apos;s provided photo, Gemini responded with a massive chunk of repeating words that didn&apos;t help the user with their query.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1d7use9/anyone_knows_what_is_this/">Another report</a> showed the AI responding to the question, "If 0 was a Roman numeral, how would it look?" Gemini delivered another huge wall of text full of words and symbols that didn&apos;t help. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGemini/comments/1d7ee8y/not_cauchy/">Redditor posted</a> an example of Gemini being completely off base when asked about satellite TV channels.</p><p>The AI promptly delivered a wall of "Not Cauchy, Cauchy, Cauchy," which is about the Cauchy Sequence, a mathematical concept.</p><p>While not widespread, these problems with Gemini are annoying at worst. The AI isn&apos;t entirely broken, as a quick refresh or asking the question again has seemingly worked fine. The publication notes that Gemini&apos;s odd gibberish responses have been reported on the web and its mobile Android variant.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s generative AI has been on a weird kick lately as users may remember its AI Overviews delivering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-head-of-search-ai-overview-fix-inbound">erroneous responses</a>. Users were receiving tips to glue cheese onto their pizza and a multitude of other outlandish ideas. The company&apos;s Head of Search Liz Reid chimed in last week, stating that this is likely the result of its AI not understanding how to weed out "nonsensical" and "satirical" questions.</p><p>Such questions create an "information gap" as the questions aren&apos;t typical, so there&apos;s not much (factual) information. Google&apos;s AI pulls much more "user-generated" content which, as we all know, can be a little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overview-problems">on the humorous side</a>. Reid stated Google has gone to work to implement a limiter for Search&apos;s AI to reduce the "inclusion of satire and humor content."</p>
