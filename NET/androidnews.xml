                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio sells products in about a dozen categories, but it&apos;s the brand&apos;s budget DACs and IEMs that contribute to its bottom line in a meaningful way. There has been a lot of excitement in this area in recent months, with Fiio launching a lot of new models in its dongle DAC range, and the brand is now focusing on its Bluetooth offerings.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13</a> do a great job delivering a clean sound in a tiny chassis, they need to be plugged in — you don&apos;t get Bluetooth connectivity. Thankfully, the brand has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr5-2021-review">BTR5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr7-review">BTR7</a> if you want Bluetooth DACs, and both are highly regarded; I use the BTR7 extensively. And now, there&apos;s a new entrant in this segment: the BTR15.</p><p>Although the naming convention suggests the BTR15 should be the flagship offering, it is an updated model of the BTR5 that has a ton of enticing features. It shares the same design as the BTR5, but you get a larger OLED panel, updated Bluetooth modem with Bluetooth 5.1, and the ability to deliver up to 340mW of power, which is more than the BTR7.</p><p>The best part? The BTR15 retails for just $109, which is lower than the launch price of the BTR5.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DTuB8XnTcz3xmjprPzwfKD" name="fiio-btr15-13.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DTuB8XnTcz3xmjprPzwfKD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio launched the BTR15 back in October 2023, and the DAC is now available globally. Over in the U.S., the DAC is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-BTR15-Headphone-Resolution-Smartphones/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">for $109 on Amazon</a>, and you can pick it up from a variety of audio retailers. The DAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/FIIO-BTR15-Bluetooth-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">costs £114 in the U.K.</a>, and in India, it is available for ₹9,999 ($120).</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-what-i-like"><span>Fiio BTR15: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB" name="fiio-btr15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio really doesn&apos;t like changing the design of its products between generations, and as a result, the BTR15 shares a lot of design similarities to the BTR5. Both have the same aesthetic with dual curved sides — similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> — and there&apos;s glass coating the front and back panels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD" name="fiio-btr15-14.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the chassis is constructed out of aluminum, and the build quality is exquisite. The design itself is rather elegant, and it gives the BTR15 a sense of refinement that belies its price tag. I used the DAC for the better part of three months, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC" name="fiio-btr15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 37.3g, the BTR15 is small enough that you can just carry it in your pocket, and the diminutive size makes it a great choice. It is a smidgen narrower and thicker than the BTR5, but other than that, the design is fundamentally unchanged.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QpvL4FKQgvSD7QDBWFDwpD" name="fiio-btr15-17.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QpvL4FKQgvSD7QDBWFDwpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get all the buttons on the right, and there is a lot to cover. There&apos;s the power button, multifunction button, volume rocker, and a toggle that lets you switch between Bluetooth, PC, and phone modes. The buttons are tiny, but they have good tactile feedback.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-connectivity-you-need-2">All the connectivity you need</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC" name="fiio-btr15-9.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key difference over the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has a 4.4mm port alongside the standard 3.5mm port. The BTR5 had a 2.5mm port for the balanced connection, but with the inclusion of a 4.4mm port, you can use the BTR15 with a significantly wider range of products, including headsets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C" name="fiio-btr15-6.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can connect the BTR15 with your phone via Bluetooth or USB-C, and the DAC uses Qualcomm&apos;s QCC5125 modem, offering Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. This is the same modem that&apos;s used in costlier DACs like the Q15 and K9, so it&apos;s great to see Fiio bringing it to a budget product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC" name="fiio-btr15-10.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to greater range, the QCC5125 unlocks high-res audio codecs; you get LDAC along with the full suite of AptX codecs, including AptX, AptX LL, AptX Adaptive, and AptX HD. The BTR15 has a 550mAh battery, and it lasts just over six hours in LDAC mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD" name="fiio-btr15-12.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another major difference is the screen; the BTR15 has a larger 0.96-inch OLED panel, and it has higher contrast text, making it easy to read outdoors. You can use the screen to navigate the settings, including adjusting the gain, tweaking the EQ, switching to the built-in car mode, and a whole lot more. You can also use the Fiio Control app to change all the setting.</p>
<p>The default screen shows the mode currently in use, volume level, gain, and battery indicator. The screen gives the BTR15 a distinct edge over the KA series of dongle DACs.</p>
<h2 id="outstanding-sound-2">Outstanding sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uikajJgxmAAzWZ2Jjvn9xA" name="fiio-btr15-1.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uikajJgxmAAzWZ2Jjvn9xA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR15 features dual ESS ES9219MQ DACs, and the USB side of things is handled by an XMOS XU316. It goes up to 384kHz/32-bit over PCM and has DSD256, but it&apos;s the power on offer that makes it stand out against the BTR5 and even the BTR7.</p><p>The BTR15 manages to deliver 165mW of power at 16Ω and 125mW at 32Ω over the 3.5mm port, and it goes up to 270mW at 16Ω and 340mW at 32Ω when using the balanced 4.4mm port. It is more powerful than the BTR7 in this regard, and it is able to drive just about any IEM in the market, as well as planar headsets like the FT5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC" name="fiio-btr15-7.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the BTR15 has the same clean sound that&apos;s a characteristic of the brand&apos;s budget DACs, and you get a slight hint of warmth that makes using it enjoyable. I tested the DAC with the Fiio FX15 and FT5, and both proved to be good pairings; the BTR15 was able to deliver a vibrant bass with good texture, unlocking the potential of the FX15. The mid-range is natural and has plenty of clarity, with vocals coming through with good articulation.</p><p>The treble is detailed and airy, and the biggest difference between the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has better resolution overall.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-what-i-didn-t-like"><span>Fiio BTR15: What I didn't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E" name="fiio-btr15-15.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There really isn&apos;t much to criticize with the BTR15. The only quibble I have with the design is that the glass panels tend to smudge easily, and the back is prone to scratches if you carry it around in your pocket. This can be mitigated by using the bundled clear case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD" name="fiio-btr15-16.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR5 had a nifty option to use NFC to connect to phones easily, and that&apos;s missing on the BTR15. It isn&apos;t a huge omission by itself, but it was a cool feature. Also, you don&apos;t get a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box any longer; with the iPhone 15 models switching over to USB-C, Fiio has decided to bundle just a USB-C cable and a USB-A dongle in the package, so if you&apos;re using an older iPhone, you will need to source a small USB-C to Lightning cable.</p>
<p>There&apos;s no fast charging, so even though the BTR15 has a small 550mAh battery, it takes nearly two hours to charge the DAC. My Magic 6 Pro has a battery that&apos;s nearly ten times larger, and it takes just under an hour to charge. Obviously, the BTR15 is designed to be used for much longer than a phone, and it makes sense that Fiio wants to prolong battery life, but fast charging of up to 10W would have made a difference — right now, it only goes up to 5W. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-should-you-buy-it"><span>Fiio BTR15: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB" name="fiio-btr15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a Bluetooth DAC with plenty of power</li><li>You need a balanced 4.4mm port</li><li>You want good battery life</li><li>You need a DAC that's easily pocketable</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want fast charging</li></ul>
<p>Having switched to the BTR15 from the BTR5 and BTR7, it&apos;s easy to tell that Fiio is onto a winner. The DAC delivers a clean sound and retains a lot of the same tonal characteristics as the BTR7, and the increased power on offer makes it a better choice if you&apos;re interested in a Bluetooth DAC to use with a headset.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the value to consider. At $109, the BTR15 is the best value in the brand&apos;s DAC portfolio as of writing. It manages to outmatch the BTR5 considerably, and has notable wins against the costlier BTR7, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The mid-range or sub-$500 smartphone segment continues to be a bustling one especially in price-sensitive markets like India. Realme has managed to carve a niche for itself here by continually delivering new offerings with improved specs and great designs. The latter aspect has always been the brand&apos;s signature recipe for any new smartphone, and that’s still going strong in 2024. </p><p>The Realme 12 series is the latest number offering from the Chinese brand and already, we have about five different models ranging from $150 to about $400. The one on test today is the Realme 12 Plus 5G, which sits somewhere in the middle of the pack and yet, manages to cram some pretty impressive features. </p><p>Realme claims it’s the first in the segment to get a 50MP Sony LYT-600 main camera sensor, along with IP54 water resistance with “Rainwater Smart Touch” treatment for the display, and a 120Hz AMOLED display with incredibly high peak brightness. These features, coupled with a sophisticated design and aggressive pricing makes it a very tempting proposition. It’s time to find out if you should indeed consider it over the competition. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-9.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is available in many Southeast Asian countries like India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. I received the Indian retail unit of the top-end variant, priced at Rs. 21,999 ($265), which comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The base variant isn’t much cheaper at Rs. 20,999 ($253) and has the same amount of RAM but 128GB of storage. Needless to say, you should get the 256GB variant directly if you&apos;re considering this phone, as it’s the best value for money. </p><p>The 12 Plus 5G comes in two colors, Pioneer green and Navigator beige. The latter is more of a neutral shade and will go well with any attire, but the green variant certainly has its own charm and looks equally striking. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-realme-12-plus-5g-what-i-like"><span>Realme 12 Plus 5G: What I like </span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-7.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The entire 12 series is built around the same design language in partnership with luxury watch designer Ollivier Savéo. The single, circular rear camera dial, vegan leather back panel, and the diamond-patterned stripe running vertically through the center of the phone are all said to be inspired by luxury watches. The Pro models in the series get more intricate patterns, but for what it costs, I think the Realme 12 Plus looks stylish and unique. The faux leather back also means there’s no worry of cracks if you drop it or ugly fingerprint smudges. </p><p>The phone doesn’t feel too heavy at 190g despite packing a large display and battery. Realme has included a headphone jack for those who still prefer wired audio, and the second slot of the dual-SIM tray can accommodate a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> if you need more storage. The Redmi 12 Plus is also IP54-rated for dust and water resistance, which is a big deal in this segment. It’s not waterproof, but it should easily survive a heavy drizzle or light splashes of water. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-5.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display on the Realme 12 Plus is also very good for its segment. It’s a flat 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with a FHD+ (2,400x1,080) resolution and a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate. The protective glass has 3D-curved edges all around so it’s gentle on your fingers when performing gestures. Color reproduction is vibrant and the screen has a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits (600 nits typical). </p><p>Thanks to this, content was always easily visible, even under the harsh Mumbai summer heat. The vibrancy of colors can be adjusted in the Settings app, but I found the default Vivid profile to be quite accurate. I also didn’t notice any major color shift when viewing the display off-axis, which is a good sign.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VzKwuTMbkJ52mgyyZQ4Qf7" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-12.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VzKwuTMbkJ52mgyyZQ4Qf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 12 Plus 5G’s display also gets something called a Rainwater Smart Touch feature. This is supposed to maintain accurate touch response even when water falls on the display and also keeps the in-display fingerprint reader functional with moist fingers. </p><p>This kind of works to an extent, but not always. For instance, the display still registers phantom touches when placed under running water, but once removed, it’s actually usable even with big droplets still on the screen. Using the fingerprint sensor in such conditions was hit or miss, as it worked sometimes but struggled to register otherwise.  </p>

<p>The performance of the Realme 12 Plus 5G has been a smooth affair in the two weeks I’ve been using it. It’s backed by a decently powerful MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, which is a bit more potent than a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 but on par or little behind something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> in benchmarks. </p><p>If you’re a casual mobile gamer like myself, then you’ll enjoy playing games like Asphalt 9: Legends or Call of Duty Mobile (with low to medium graphics) on the 12 Plus. The visuals are great, the framerate is generally solid, and the sound from the stereo speakers will keep you engaged for hours. Some portion of the frame and the rear camera bump get a bit warm after, say, 30 minutes of playing, but never overly hot. The screen has a standard 240Hz touch sampling rate, which I found to be adequate. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G worked well on the 5G networks here in India. The phone supports a total of nine 5G bands, some of which are also supported by all the major U.S. carriers, which means you can easily use the phone on your travels to the U.S. NFC is not present, but you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<p>Battery life is quite impressive, too, with the 5,000mAh capacity easily lasting for up to two full days on one charge. Even with a bit of gaming and heavy camera testing, I was still able to go past one full day of use. The 12 Plus 5G can also be charged quickly, thanks to 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging. In practice, you can get a 50 percent charge in just under 20 minutes. The best thing about Realme phones is that the charger comes bundled in the box. </p>

<p>The primary camera on the Realme 12 Plus 5G is pretty good for the segment. The 50MP Sony LYT-600 sensor is optically stabilized (OIS) and has an aperture of f/1.9. Photos are saved at roughly 12.5MP resolution by default, but you can take a full 50MP photo if you need to. Landscapes and close-up photos generally have good sharpness, vivid colors, and decent details in daylight. The ultrawide also manages some decent shots here under bright sunlight. Low-light shots from the main camera are fairly detailed, autofocus is quick, and you can get away with shooting single-handed in Night mode (with a one-second delay) thanks to OIS.</p>

<p>The large sensor also lets you do a 2x lossless zoom (in-sensor crop). Some interesting shooting modes include Street, which lets you toggle an auto-zoom feature. Once you tap your subject, the app tries to aesthetically frame the shot by zooming in on it. You also get the usual selection of shooting modes like slow-mo, timelapse, etc. The 12 Plus 5G can also shoot videos up to 4K 30fps, but without any stabilization.</p>

<p>Apart from the main camera on the 12 Plus 5G, the rest are pretty run-of-the-mill sensors that fail to impress. The rear camera dials make it look like there are four cameras, but one of them is just a dummy to complete the symmetry. The 8-megapixel ultrawide camera fares well in daylight, with minimal barrel distortion, but colors and details are weak compared to the main camera. In low light, Night mode helps maintain a decent exposure, but peek a bit closer, and you&apos;ll notice colors and details are simply lacking. </p><p>There’s a 2MP macro camera in the dial, too, but it’s not great and best left unused. Sadly, the 16MP selfie camera isn’t much to shout about either. You can expect passable selfies under good lighting but average ones in low light. There’s a screen flash to assist in low-light shots, but it can only do so much. </p><p>The quality of recorded video is fairly average too from the ultrawide camera. You can only record up to 1080p 30fps with it, but if you begin recording with the main camera at this resolution, there’s no way to switch to the ultrawide mid-shooting. </p>

<p>My main gripe with the 12 Plus 5G is the bloated nature of Realme UI 5.0 itself. It’s a derivation of Oppo’s ColorOS, which has also received touches of OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS along the way. This version is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and Realme claims that it will get three years of software updates. Unfortunately, there are simply way too many redundant and spammy apps that are preinstalled, and even when you first set up the phone, it feels like someone has been using it for a month.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-13.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have to be mindful to skip suggested app installs during initial setup, or else you’ll be saddled with even more apps before you even begin. What makes it worse is the non-stop notifications from some of them that clutter your notification shade. Thankfully, you can minimize this by disabling most of the suggestions within the apps, but it’s still annoying having to deal with it in the first place. </p><p>My other little niggle is with the phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature or the fact that you can’t exactly have it <em>always </em>on. There’s usually an option to enable this, but it’s absent from the 12 Plus 5G. This means the AOD disappears if you place the phone down and only activates again if you get a notification or move it a bit. </p>

<p>Finally, the 12 Plus 5G is a large phone and while that 190g of total weight is distributed well, the flat nature of the frame is not the most comfortable to hold and use, especially with one hand. The glossy finish of the side rail is also a pain to keep clean and as it attracts dust and fingerprints almost immediately. </p>

<p>As impressive as the features are of the Realme 12 Plus for its segment, there are other players with equally impressive rivals. The Poco X6 5G starts at roughly the same price but offers double the storage, and it even has a 512GB variant with 12GB of RAM for not much more. It packs a more potent Snapdragon SoC and Gorilla Glass Victus, while staying competitive in all other areas with Realme. </p><p>The iQoo Z9 is another recent offering with a feature set similar to the 12 Plus 5G. It, too, features a very capable Sony main camera sensor and a more power-efficient 4nm MediaTek SoC. </p>
<p>Realme’s own premium models are not too far off, either. By spending a bit more, you can get the Realme 12 Pro 5G, which has a more premium design, curved-edge display, a better chipset, and a portrait camera with 2x optical zoom. There’s also the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> which has the unique transparent back with programmable notification lights and superb all-round performance. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a unique-looking phone without spending a lot   </li><li>You want certified water resistance </li><li> You want a vivid display and great battery life  </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a lean version of Android </li><li> You want quality selfie and ultrawide cameras </li><li> You play a lot of heavy games  </li></ul>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is a solid budget offering that checks off most of the boxes if you’re shopping in this segment. Design has always been one of Realme’s strong suits, and it’s on full display here. The vegan leather finish and luxury watch-inspired camera dial on the back is sure to turn heads, as it makes it look more expensive than it actually is. It’s also water resistant, supports expandable storage, and has a headphone jack. The performance is decent, the display is bright and punchy, the battery life is great, and the main camera is reliable no matter the time of day. </p><p>A couple of things that you might not like is the annoying fluff in Realme UI. The redundant apps and their tendency to spam you with ads and unsolicited suggestions get annoying very quickly. The secondary cameras could have been a lot better, too, especially in low light. Finally, if you’re in the U.S., then you’re out of luck trying to get this. In fact, Realme hasn’t yet launched the 12 series outside a handful of Southeast Asian countries. Not to worry, as there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">good cheap Android phones</a> that are more easily accessible. </p>

<hr>
<p>Fairphone announces the launch of its "Fairbuds," which follow behind its smartphones in terms of user-reparability.</p><p>According to a press release, the Android and iOS-compatible earbuds are the smaller counterpart to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fairphone-fairbuds-xl-launch">Fairbuds XL</a> headphones from 2023. The new buds boast "premium" quality sound through the provided 11mm drivers. Fairphone adds users can enable active noise cancellation (ANC), which includes wind noise reduction, for a richer experience.</p><p>Additionally, the Fairbuds feature "crystal clear calling" for users indoors and outdoors, courtesy of its ENC (environmental noise canceling) functionality. Speaking of (no pun intended), the buds deliver six microphones in total so the device can capture every word. Moreover, the Fairbuds offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, giving users the ability to connect to two devices at once.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-example.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in its black colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the new Fairbuds is a talking point as Fairphone states the device delivers a "modular design" full of user-replaceable parts. Its specifications sheet states the Fairbuds feature seven spare parts that users can grab if something goes wrong. The parts available include new earbuds, battery and silicon ring, earbud tips, charging case shell, case core, and the case&apos;s battery.</p><p>If something goes wrong, users in Europe can grab these spare parts on the Fairphone webshop.</p><p>The Fairbuds contain a 45mAh battery, while the charging case features a 500mAh battery capacity. Fairphone states its buds can last for six hours on a full charge, with an additional 20 hours housed inside the charging case. As a quick pick-me-up, the Fairbuds can gain 1.5 hours of playback time in 10 minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1165px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.50%;"><img id="SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ" name="fairphone-fairbuds-white-colorway-launch.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in a white colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1165" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fairbuds have received an IP54 rating for sweat and water resistance. The press release states that the buds and cases were created with 70% recycled "fair materials." Software-wise, the company states that consumers can utilize their Fairbuds with Google Assistant and Apple&apos;s Siri for hands-free help.</p><p>Users in Europe looking for the Fairbuds will also receive a three-year warranty — which is a one-year extension of the brand&apos;s typical two-year plan.</p><p>Consumers across Europe can get their hands on Fairphone&apos;s latest Fairbuds for €149. The buds are available for pre-order beginning today (Apr. 9) on the Fairphone website and a few select European retailers. The company states the €149 price tag will vary from country to country in the region. Those interested will find the device in white and black colorways.</p>

A departure from traditional open-ear designs, they look as much like jewelry as they do consumer technology, so much so that I’m considering buying some earcuffs now. But these earlobe adornments are so much more than just fashionable; they are highly functional. </p><p>These premium open-ears give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Hi-Res audio</a> support, some spatial audio wizardry, Bluetooth 5.3, and more. They’re pricey, but for all that you get, I think they’re worth it if open earbuds are what you’re looking for. One issue here rubs me the wrong way, but I’ll get into that in a bit.</p>

<p>Bose Ultra Open earbuds went on sale on February 15, 2024, and are available in two colorways: Black and White Smoke. You can pick up a pair directly from Bose for $299 or from various retailers like Best Buy and Amazon for the same price. I’ve had them for a while now, and I don’t recall seeing this at launch, but on their website, you can also purchase them bundled with a wireless charging case cover <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds-earbuds-sets/SET-UOE-WLSCH.html">for an additional $48</a>, bringing the total cost to $348. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I won’t belabor the point since I made it in the verdict and intro, but aesthetically, I’m in love with this design. The fit and finish are premium down to how they’re seated into the case. With some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, you find yourself almost having to dig them out of their charging case, but the Bose Ultra kind of just sit on top of their seats in the case. Connected by strong magnets, when you hold them near, they snap into their seat. In front of their seats, you get bright LEDs that indicate the charging status of each earbud, which is in addition to the status LED on the front of the case.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A departure from traditional open-ear designs, they look as much like jewelry as they do consumer technology, so much so that I’m considering buying some earcuffs now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>No extra ear tips or wings with these as they are an ear cuff design with the speaker portion sitting inside the antitragus or antihelix, depending on how you position it. The battery is on the other end of the cuff and sits behind the ear. The fit is snug, but I’ve worn these for hours and only felt a bit of wear fatigue on my right ear, not my left.</p><p>At the gym, they don’t move at all! So you’re solid if you use these for dynamic HIIT workouts, and you don’t need to worry about sweat as they’re IPX4 water-resistant. Wearing them at my gym, I was surprised that the music from these wasn’t drowned out by the terrible selection playing on the house speakers.</p><p>As someone who spends a lot of time in the gym, I love the tactile buttons. They’re large, easy to operate, and quite responsive.</p>
<h2 id="bose-quot-ultra-quot-open-sound-2">Bose "Ultra" Open sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YGHJk66X86nPovfgXsXbcM" name="bose-ultra-open-single-earbud.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGHJk66X86nPovfgXsXbcM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The default stereo sound is good, and the three-band equalizer in the Bose Music app makes it even better, but it’s the Immersive Audio and Auto Volume features that elevate the listening experience to the level of premium pricing. Open earbuds are known for having middling audio because of their positioning outside of the ear canal. That’s the whole point of the product segment, after all, but Bose went into the lab and designed OpenAudio technology, which combines a powerful transducer and an acoustic structure that does a magnificent job of delivering audio into your ear.</p><p>This is great because Immersive Audio, which is Bose’s version of spatial audio, really shines with the Bose Ultra Open earbuds. It’s a virtualization that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you and allows you to choose from one of two head tracking options: Still and Motion. “Still” keeps audio in a fixed position in front of you, so no matter where you turn your head, the audio comes from one direction. “Motion” moves with you and where you turn your head.</p><p>Listening to music and movies was a joy with Immersive Audio turned on. Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 Reality audio tracks.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You'll get breat audio from the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, but there are some things you'll want to take note of.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The full audio picture is nuanced though, so let’s briefly talk about that. The louder the Bose Ultra Open earbuds pump audio, the less robust it becomes. At lower volumes, the audio pumped into your ear is richer. There’s more perceived bass response and warmer mids, with treble quality staying consistent at various volumes.</p><p>This goes back to auditory masking. The whole idea of open ear is that your surroundings are just as — if not more important than — what’s coming in through your earbuds. So, at the loudest volumes, the audio isn’t meant to be overpowering but is meant to take a backseat to whatever is going on around you. At no time during my testing was this an issue when passively listening to music, but I can see there being some challenges in very noisy places when talking on the phone.</p><p>One day during my review period, I was out on a busy street having a conversation with my father, and his audio was definitely competing with the street noise. Again, that’s a feature, not a bug, but it’s something you should be aware of. I could hear him clearly, but I had to focus a bit more than if I was wearing some active noise-canceling earbuds.</p><p>That aside, other premium features I like are audible notifications and aptX Adaptive support. Audible notifications aren’t just beeps and tones but voice prompts and confirmations like speaking the name of the phone you’re connected to or telling you the battery charge status.</p><p>Battery life has also exceeded expectations, lasting six hours with Immersive Audio and Auto Volume activated. Bose says I should be getting just four and a half hours with Immersive on. My listening level was around 20% or 30% of max volume on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>’s volume slider, but with Auto Volume activated, it’s hard to say this was the real volume level being pumped out at any given time.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-auto-volume-and-auditory-masking"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: Auto Volume and auditory masking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-battery-barrel.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Auditory masking is defined as “when the perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another.” Unlike earbuds, which sit in your ear, open earbuds are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/transparency-mode-killed-open-ear-headphones-for-me">very vulnerable to masking caused by environmental noise.</a> I mean, that’s the entire point of them being open. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 tracks. 
</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To bring balance to the experience, Bose implemented a feature called Auto Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume of whatever you’re listening to based on the noise around you. In short, when you’re in a quiet office with the volume set fairly low since there’s no competing noise then step out onto the hustle and bustle of the urban street, the Ultra Open automatically increases audio volume to combat that auditory masking.</p><p>I kept this feature on most of the time, and it did a fantastic job of raising and lowering volume as I moved through different environments. I absolutely noticed it adjusting, but it was smooth, and I think I may have noticed more because I was listening for it and being critical for this review. In time, I think I might forget that it’s happening, and I could see this feature melting into the background.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-what-could-use-some-work"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: What could use some work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-demonstrating-fit.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ok, I love almost everything about the Bose Ultra Open earbuds, except two things in particular, although one of them is just one of those “its strength can also be a weakness” conundrums.</p><p>By default, these $299 earbuds don’t come with a wireless charging case, even though their competitors include the feature. Never fear, as Bose “solves” this “problem” by giving you the option to purchase a $48 charging case accessory, bringing the total price to $348 if you want your earbuds equipped similarly to Sony’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">WF-1000XM5</a>, or Sennheiser’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a>. In 2024, for $299, the original case should already be Qi-enabled. Instead, you get USB-C charging only.</p><p>You won’t get multipoint right now, but Bose has a feature in the app that allows you to switch connections from one device to another. You can even program the earbuds with a shortcut to switch connected devices without taking your phone out. It’s a fairly functional workaround for not having multipoint.</p><p>Lastly, one feature that doesn’t actually need improvement but is more of a “caveat emptor” for those who may talk to work colleagues a lot or run with a partner is Auto Volume. As much as I enjoy the feature, I can see it becoming a nuisance for some, as it will likely increase your volume when you’re talking to people. You might find yourself deactivating the feature in that case so that your earbud’s audio isn’t competing with your real-world conversations.</p>

<p>In the open earbuds category, the only competition these have are the now aging original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-linkbuds-review">Sony Linkbuds with the donut holes</a>. In terms of contemporaries at this price point that I’ve had the chance to review, I don’t think there are any. </p><p>However, other open earbuds you can consider include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a>, which cost quite a bit less but feature rich audio and great battery life. You will have to deal with finicky touch controls, and there&apos;s no automatic wear detection or automatic shut-off, which can be a problem for those who forget to turn them off.</p><p>I don’t want to get too deep in the weeds here, but the point of open earbuds is that they don’t obstruct environmental noise, which means that, ideally, they don’t obstruct your ear canal. Knowing how soundwaves work, other than the donut hole Linkbuds, the Bose Ultra Open are among the only earbuds that don’t obstruct environmental noise or sit over your ear canal, they’re truly “open.”</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Situational awareness is your priority.</li><li>You want earbuds that are simple to operate</li><li>You want premium open earbuds.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>The $299 price tag is steep for you.</li><li>You don’t have another $48 to spend on wireless charging.</li><li>You need that BASS!</li></ul>
<p>If you’re looking for a pair of premium open earbuds, look no further. Bose Ultra Open earbuds are next-level open ears with some innovative audio features that are worth the price of admission. You have some future-proofing with Snapdragon Sound support and Bluetooth 5.3 implementation, and did I mention they look great? The only thing that may stop some shoppers from buying may be the price tag and that wireless charging hitch. But if those aren’t deal breakers, these are the ones to get. Full stop!</p>

<p>Google is hosting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/welcome-to-google-cloud-next24">Cloud Next 2024</a> conference where it got candid on new generative AI features for Workspace and the debut of a new app.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/workspace-cloud-next-2024/">Keyword post</a>, the company introduced its newest Workspace app, "Google Vids." The announcement states that this "AI-powered" video creation app can help users generate storyboards with several options for editing and stylizing. Google Vids is also said to feature voice-over capabilities. Users can pick between pre-set voices or use their own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC" name="google-vids-video-template-example.jpg" alt="An example of the various video templates for "Google Vids."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re having trouble with styles, Google Vids offers a range of templates users can look through. The company states its AI software will suggest scenes from stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Since this is going into Workspace, users can add others to collaborate on the video. Google adds that users can "share projects securely" directly from their browsers. Google Vids is expected to arrive in Workspace Labs in June 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP" name="google-docs-cloud-next-2024-ai-features-teased.jpg" alt="Google Docs is preparing to receive new customization features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Docs is preparing to pick up a new "tabs experience," according to the update post. The company states the new feature is designed to help users "organize related information" in a document. Better document customization is en route in the form of new cover images that extend the length of the page horizontally.</p><p>The company states this update to Docs will arrive "in the coming weeks."</p><p>Sheets is gaining new goodies for its table feature. Google says this update will make it easier for Workspace users to "format and organize" their data through its upcoming design refresh. A new array of templates will accompany this, making it easy for users to hop into a ready-made sheet without beginning from zero.</p><p>These updates for Sheets will appear "in the coming weeks" as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.19%;"><img id="6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa" name="google-gmail-cloud-next-2024-gemini-polish.jpg" alt="Gmail is receiving new voice capabilities for "Help me write" and Gemini's "Polish" arrives for Workspace customers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="291" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gmail made a quick appearance with Google preparing to roll out an update to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">Help me write</a>" that brings voice capabilities. Gemini will be included in a coming update for Gmail as it delivers a way for users to turn their notes into an email. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14199860?hl=en">Gemini in Gmail</a> is available through Workspace Labs but appears slowly as the company rolls it out.</p><p>Google states Gemini Enterprise, Business, and Google One AI Premium customers will be able to take advantage of these new tools.</p><p>Cloud Next 2024 showed Google&apos;s willingness to fine-tune some other areas of Workspace, starting with Meet. The company is planning on launching "Translate for me in Meet" in the next few months, which brings automatic detection and translation for captions. To go with this, Google is adding support for 52 additional languages.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this will only be available to customers who purchase the new AI Meetings and Messaging add-on for $10 "per user per month." The company states this feature will arrive in June, and the add-on can be attached to "select" Workspace plans.</p><p>Lastly, "AI Security" is on its way to select Workspace plans as a $10 add-on. Google says the feature will let IT teams protect sensitive files for an entire company in Drive. AI Security does piggyback off Google&apos;s AI software. The AI is said to evaluate, classify, and protect files for users continuously.</p><p>AI security is available today (Apr. 9) for Workspace users.</p>

<ul><li>Automattic, owners of WordPress, announced that it has acquired Beeper in its quest to bring better communication to users.</li><li>Sources claim that this merger was agreed upon for $125 million.</li><li>Automattic states that its acquisition of Beeper will roll into its plans to merge it with its recently acquired messaging platform, Texts.com.</li><li>Beeper also announced it has launched its new, revamped messaging app on Google's Play Store today (Apr. 9) for all Android users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Automattic, owners of WordPress, has reportedly cemented a deal to acquire the messaging platform Beeper.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://automattic.com/2024/04/09/automattic-acquires-beeper/">press release</a>, the company states its recent acquisition of Beeper is part of its larger narrative to "push the boundaries of messaging." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-multi-service-messaging-app-beeper-for-125m/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a> cites sources close to the matter who state the deal was made for $125 million. Automattic teases that there&apos;s more in store with its acquisition of Beeper, as the messaging platform already supports 14 different messaging services in one app.</p><p>The post adds that Automattic will look to merge Beeper&apos;s team with Texts.com, a service the company acquired late last year. This is its "next step toward the dream of combining all online conversations in a safe, secure, and effective way."</p><p>Automattic states users can expect a "streamlined" experience once the merger is completed. When it does, Texts will fall under the Beeper brand. The company adds end-to-end encryption (E2EE), a "dozen" app integrations, and more.</p><p>Automattic doesn&apos;t have an exact timeframe for users to expect its Texts and Beeper merger to take place, but it says more updates will come when its "phased plan" is ready.</p><p>During TechCrunch&apos;s conversation with Beeper&apos;s founder Eric Migicovsky, he said the eventual plan is to manage chats under its new protocol, "Matrix." The protocol is said to feature an E2EE open-source client, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-mastodon">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Migicovsky commented on the acquisition, stating, "It was either time to raise more funding or find a buyer" due to Beeper&apos;s high costs.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/">Beeper announced</a> that its new app on Android has finally launched on the Play Store. The new app brings a fresh design, the ability for users to modify their chat networks, full message search, and more. The post states that there isn&apos;t any support for iMessage, although the U.S. government&apos;s lawsuit against Apple, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24071226/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-apple-beeper-mini">FCC involvement</a>, could turn things around.</p><p>Beeper and Apple had been at it ever since the former found a way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-lawmakers-urge-doj-investigation-apple-vs-beeper">reverse-engineer iMessage</a> and bring its capabilities to Android. Apple was quick to shut it down, prompting the gaze of U.S. lawmakers who wrote a letter to the Department of Justice stating the company&apos;s actions could be "anti-competitive." Resistance didn&apos;t stop as Apple soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-drops-imessage-integration-after-apple-bans-linked-macs">started banning</a> users of Beeper Cloud and Mini who used Macs.</p><p>The company stated it removed access to iMessage for users due to "spam." Beeper then turned and disabled iMessage support in Cloud, and it&apos;s not clear if it will ever be restored.</p>

The changelog of the latest firmware indicates that it is bringing the unwanted object removal or people tool for the photos captured on the device.</p><p>In the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1568977884347891713">community post</a>, OnePlus shared the firmware details for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, dubbed <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.505</strong> version. It is currently rolling out to the Indian OnePlus 12R users in batches. The prominent aspect of the latest update is the AIGC Remover, which was earlier available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> users.</p>
<p>The latest feature on the OnePlus 12R will allow users to "remove unwanted objects or people and make your photos look cleaner." It sounds and works very similar to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> feature, which has been available for Pixel phones for a while now.</p><p>Meanwhile, OnePlus recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-launch">announced</a> a new Pixel-inspired AI feature dubbed AI Eraser, which lets users substitute unwanted objects in a photo. The AI Eraser is available for the company&apos;s prominent handsets, such as the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus Open, and the Nord CE 4.</p><p>The other highlights from the changelog comprise the ability to create photo collages without frames in photos. A new nifty shortcut has been added to turn on the flashlight by pressing the Volume Down rocker on the OnePlus 12R for a long time. Users can also adjust volumes for apps individually with a new "app-specific" feature added with the update.</p><p>There are several other improvements included with the latest update, which are per the changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Improves the volume bar's design for ease of use and visual consistency.</li><li>Improves the touch control experience in certain scenarios.</li><li>Improves the compatibility of USB connections between phones and cars, and phones and PCs.</li><li>Improves system stability.</li></ul>
<p>As mentioned, the rollout is incremental and for the Indian region. The broader rollout is expected in the next few days, notes OnePlus.</p>

<p>OnePlus 12R comes as the toned-down version of the flagship OnePlus 12 and yet manages to retain some of its best features. Unfortunately, it doesn't support UFS 4.0, but users should still see impressive storage speeds with UFS 3.1.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is bringing the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model to the U.S. for $329, according to a spotted new Amazon US listing.</p><p>The new tablet from Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Included-Speakers-Exclusive/dp/B0CWS8MNW1?th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=schoon0f-20&linkId=f4c5510b58649cffbf16c6798ae4d4a7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">already listed</a> on Amazon US (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/08/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-us-amazon-price/#more-613640">9to5Google</a>) and has two storage options: a 64GB one and a 128GB variant. Both models, however, have only 4GB of RAM. The device seems to be an Amazon Exclusive for the American market, as the listing’s description implies.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 1</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="SZinsW6C9yRE9PcE3qiMx7" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-review-12.jpeg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZinsW6C9yRE9PcE3qiMx7.jpeg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Review </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>While the base variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">cheaper Android tablet</a> is priced at $329, the larger 128GB variant retails at $399. The available colorways are Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and Mint. The device appears to be shipping right away if interested buyers are subscribed to Amazon Prime.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) launched in some global markets late last month as a minor refresh to the 2020 model, which came under the same moniker. Both models appear identical in design, and most of the specs are the same except for the chipset.</p><p>The new model ships with Samsung’s in-house developed Exynos 1280 processor with 2.4GHz clock speeds — the same one that powered the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a> handset. </p>
<p>The tablet&apos;s highlights include a 10.4-inch screen—a WUXGA Plus display with a 2000 x 1200 resolution. It supports microSD expansion up to 1TB, a massive 7040mAh battery capacity with a promise of 14-hour non-stop video playback, and Dolby Atmos-certified speakers. For optics, the tablet relies on a single 8MP rear camera shooter and a 5MP for selfies.</p><p>The device is also accompanied by an S-Pen for productivity, which includes the ability to take notes while the tablet screen is locked and support for Samsung DeX. The device also comprises two models: a Wi-Fi-only model and an LTE variant, but the Amazon above listing doesn’t mention the LTE variant.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google introduces Axion, a powerful chip designed for data centers, capable of handling various tasks including Google searches and AI operations.</li><li>Axion is Google's first custom Arm-based CPU for data centers, promising to provide significant performance improvements over current cloud tools.</li><li>Google plans to offer virtual machines powered by Axion processors to customers in the coming months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu" target="_blank">introduced</a> a brand new chip called Axion for data centers, and it&apos;s touted to be capable of handling everything from Google searches to AI tasks.</p><p>Axion is Google&apos;s first custom Arm-based CPU for data centers, built using Arm&apos;s Neoverse V2 CPU platform. Axion will be the muscle behind all sorts of things you use every day, like Google searches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-weighing-making-search-generative-experience-a-paid-feature">AI-powered tasks</a>.</p><p>Google says Axion knocks it out of the park, crushing current Arm-based cloud tools by 30% and leaving even the latest x86-based virtual machines (VMs) in the dust, with a 50% performance boost. Plus, it sips power more efficiently, saving 60% compared to those old x86 VMs.</p><p>The Mountain View-based tech giant is using the same circuitry built by Arm as Amazon and Microsoft to design the Axion chip. That makes Google the third big tech company to jump on board with this framework, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-expands-in-house-chip-efforts-in-costly-ai-battle-3121c852" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>Google says it has already put Axion to work internally, running first-party services such as BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on Google Cloud. And it plans to keep ramping up its use in the future.</p><p>Google plans to give us a sneak peek at virtual machines powered by Axion processors in the next few months. Later this year, Axion will be up for grabs for all Google Cloud customers.</p><p>To set the record straight, the company is not going to sell Axion chips directly to customers. Instead, it&apos;ll let you rent access to this custom hardware.</p><p>Google has been designing its own chips for a while now, mostly for the Pixel phones (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>) to make them faster and better. The company also makes special chips called "Tensor Processing Unit" (TPU) to help run its data centers, since way back in 2015.</p><p>There are a couple reasons why Google built Axion. First, it wants to be less reliant on other companies for parts, as per WSJ. Second, it lets the company compete better with cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft, which are also building their own superchips. Basically, it&apos;s an arms race for faster and more efficient cloud services.</p><p>Google is betting big on its new Axion chip to handle the ever-growing need for computing power, especially for AI services.</p>

You can also control the volume from an easy-to-access area so that both devices have the volume of audio you want.</p><p>Whether the earbuds you share your music with are among the best<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-spatial-audio-earbuds"> that support spatial audio</a> or not, you&apos;ll find the helpful feature. Those days of giving your friend one of the earbuds are long gone.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-samsung-dual-audio-2">What is Samsung Dual Audio?</h2>
<p>Samsung Dual Audio lets you connect your Galaxy phone to two Bluetooth headphones simultaneously. This feature is useful when hiking with friends and both want to hear the same music. You and your friend can listen to the same Spotify music list, and you can even control <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-control-spotify-music-from-strava-app">it from the Strava app</a> if you like.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-dual-audio-on-my-samsung-2">How do I use Dual Audio on my Samsung?</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Dual Audio feature won&apos;t work on all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>. During my testing using a Galaxy A series phone, it was not available. It was not until I switched to an S series Galaxy phone that it became available. If you follow the steps but can&apos;t access Dual Audio, your Galaxy phone will not support it.</p><p>To start using Dual Audio, you must pair your first earbuds.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Connections</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and toggle it on. Make sure that the earbuds you want to pair are also on. You can also swipe down from the top of your display, long-press on the Bluetooth icon, and look for the earbuds in the Searching for Devices section. You can also choose from the devices that have been paired already.</p>

<p>4. You must <strong>pair two sets of earbuds</strong>. Don&apos;t worry about losing the connection for the first set of earbuds when pairing the second. The first connection will remain when you pair the second set of earbuds.</p><p>5. Once paired, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the <strong>top of your display</strong> and tap on <strong>Media Output</strong>. You can also try swiping down twice to check if the option appears.</p><p>6. When you see the <strong>two earbuds</strong> you paired, <strong>select them</strong>.</p>

<p>You can use any brand of Bluetooth speakers or earbuds to use the feature. As you can see in the image above, you can control the volume for both devices from the same area. You also have the option of the volume buttons as usual. If you ever want to go back to only listening to music from one device, all you need to do is deselect one of the devices.</p><p>There could be a slight lag when using Dual Audio, but hopefully, it won&apos;t be much of a problem.</p>
<h2 id="which-samsung-phones-have-dual-audio-2">Which Samsung phones have Dual Audio?</h2>
<p>Bluetooth 5.0 or higher is a requirement, but even then you won&apos;t find Dual Audio on every Samsung Galaxy. It is available on the latest S series, such as the Samsung Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>. The latest Galaxy Tabs S6, S7, S8 and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and below will come with the helpful feature.</p><p>You may not always want to have your music come from two devices. For those times when you only want to change your device&apos;s audio output to a single device, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-change-the-audio-output-on-android">these are the steps you need to follow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="two-is-better-than-one-2">Two is better than one</h2>
<p>The Dual Audio feature is a huge help. You could watch a movie, and a friend wants to listen to it. Now, you can pair their earbuds with your phone so they can listen in, and you can continue to enjoy the stereo sound of your earbuds, whether they are one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-earbuds">best Samsung earbuds</a> or not.</p><p>To ensure you always enjoy the latest features Samsung or any manufacturer has to offer, always have your apps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-better-at-updates-than-google">Samsung device updated</a>. The Dual Audio feature is a must-have, and we only hope it gets better and more accessible with time. The more devices you can share your audio with, the better, right?</p>
