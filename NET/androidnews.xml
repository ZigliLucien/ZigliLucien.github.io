                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>EarFun is one of the most underrated audio brands to exist in the market. The EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds are thoroughly premium and fresh out of the oven. So it&apos;s really hard to believe that this August 2024 release is already on sale — and it&apos;s not even Black Friday yet!</p><p>Don&apos;t wait around for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-samsung-deals-2024-early-deals-and-how-to-prepare-for-the-big-sales">Samsung&apos;s Black Friday discounts</a> to get a good pair of wireless earbuds. I wholeheartedly recommend the fabulous EarFun Air Pro 4 wireless earbuds for top-notch sound quality, an uber-comfortable fit, and state-of-the-art features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5M9SH1X"><strong>Amazon is offering 27% off these buds</strong></a> at the moment, bringing the price down from $89.99 to a more budget-friendly $65.99.</p><p>EarFun gives you everything and more for very little money. You get Google Fast Pair and support for codecs like Qualcomm aptX Adaptive and LDAC. Even the battery life is awesome, lasting for several days with heavy use. These hi-res earbuds are even Auracast-ready, which makes them incredibly future-proof. These are some of the many reasons why the Air Pro 4 are our top budget pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earfun-air-pro-4-review">EarFun Air Pro 4</a> wireless earbuds just came out in August 2024, so it comes as a very welcome surprise to see them 27% off already. You can these nearly-$100 earbuds for a lot more accessible price tag while this pre-Black Friday deal lasts. Equipped with premium features like Bluetooth Auracast, LDAC, and hi-res audio support, these are some high-end earbuds that sound good, look good, and feel good.</p>
<p>The deal ends in just a couple hours, so don't wait if you're interested!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5M9SH1X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="26f1aaf9-5411-4954-b579-bd75fe9ceb28" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$89.99" data-dimension48="$89.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want all the best audio codecs for audiophiles; finding comfortable earbuds is tough for you; you want something with Bluetooth Auracast to be future-proof; longevity of battery life is very important to you; you want wireless charging.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a more robust dust-proof rating; colorful options are high up on your list of must-haves.</p><p>Back when I reviewed the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earfun-air-pro-3-review">EarFun Air Pro 3 buds</a>, I said that they set the bar for 2023. Somehow, EarFun managed to one-up itself this year. The 2024 follow-up isn&apos;t just as good as its prequel — it beats it fair and square.</p><p>You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find such an awesome mix of features for so less, especially with this deal which slashes a neat 27% off the retail price. EarFun even threw in wireless charging and LED lights to indicate the battery life of the buds.</p><p>The only area where the EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds are lacking is ingress protection. You get an IPX5 splash-proof rating with these buds, which is mediocre at best. Other than that, everything else is a home run.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims the OnePlus 13 could receive Google's offline rediscovery feature, which the Pixel 9 and 8 series have.</li><li>The OnePlus 12 reportedly lacks such "hardware capabilities" to support it; however, the OnePlus 13's Snapdragon 8 Elite is capable.</li><li>Google detailed the function shortly after Find My Device hit more devices, stating (at the time) the Pixel 8 could report its location for "several hours" after turning off.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The latest OnePlus flagship phone is here, but a recent discovery could indicate more to come.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-powered-off-finding-3497244/">Android Authority</a>), a previous beta for OxygenOS 15 might've teased an upcoming Pixel-exclusive feature for the OnePlus 13. Rahman states that he downloaded the beta on a OnePlus 12 and discovered an Android-provided message when looking at its power options.</p><p>Attempting to shut down the phone displayed, "you can locate this phone with 'Find My Device' even when powered off."</p><p>Curiously, last year's flagship phone isn't receiving such support. The Chinese OEM reportedly confirmed as much to the publication. According to OnePlus' statement, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> contains an "8650 platform" via the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. This limits its capability to support offline rediscovery through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Find My Device network</a>.</p><p>Confirmation of the OnePlus 12's lack of the offline discovery feature pushed Rahman toward the 2024 flagship. The post adds that the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC contains a FastConnect 7900 connectivity subsystem. Rahman states that Qualcomm confirmed that this subsystem features all the necessities behind the appropriate connection for the Find My Device network's "Power Off Finding."</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">debuted on October 31</a> on home soil in China. Qualcomm's latest flagship SoC grants the device a massive power boost in efficiency and performance. What's more, consumers in China can experience its 6.8-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">2K Oriental display</a> with a 120Hz refresh rate alongside its large 6,000mAh battery.</p><p>The inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Elite makes it possible for OnePlus to bring offline discovery to its latest smartphone. However, Qualcomm informed Rahman that this feature is "up to OEMs to implement and use it." OnePlus did not announce "Power Off Finding" for the 13 series in October, meaning it's likely still developing it.</p><p>It's speculation, but this function <em>could </em>arrive with a future OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) update.</p><p>Shortly after the revamped Find My Device network hit more devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">Google detailed</a> how its unique Pixel-exclusive feature works. Per its document, the Pixel 8 and 9's offline discovery can function "for several hours" after the phone turns off. Google's recent two flagships were the only ones to have such functionality due to some "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">specialized Pixel hardware.</a>" With Qualcomm's latest SoC including such hardware, we may see more OEMs adopt this useful rediscovery feature.</p><p>In other news, OxygenOS 15 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">started hitting the OnePlus 12 </a>and is on tap to continue to more of its past-gen devices throughout the year.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> ranks among the best phones of 2024 because it balances elegant design with lightning-fast performance and some of the best camera tech we've used all year. You miss out on some AI features and won't get the same number of OS updates as you would with a Samsung or Pixel device, but with a whopping $150 discount on the phone at Best Buy, I'm not complaining. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-512gb-unlocked-flowy-emerald/6570639.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="92cc86e1-c5e6-4c63-a6e9-bb9657d85edd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<ul><li>A report highlights Motorola's updated patent for its rollable phone concept, Rizr.</li><li>The U.S. patent shows Motorola's plans to incorporate additional fingerprint-on-display (FOD) sensors on the "front" and "back" of the device.</li><li>Motorola showcased the Rizr during MWC 2023, showcasing its default 5-inch display and fully extended 6.5-inch screen when rolled out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has had a rollable phone concept stewing for a while and a newly published patent details some additions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/motorola-new-patent-rollable-display-full-screen-fingerprint-sensing/">MySmartPrice</a> spotted an updated patent for the company's rollable phone concept, the "Motorola Rizr." The patent details a device with multiple fingerprint-reading sensors in the USPTO database listing. According to the abstract, Motorola states the device in question "provides a predictable external fingerprint area on a 'rollable display device' for fingerprint authentication."</p><p>The company adds, "this is available at least in both a fully retracted position and fully extended position."</p><p>U.S. patents published on November 5 show at least two positions users <em>could </em>utilize on this rollable phone. The first fingerprint-on-display (FOD) sensor is on the "front" of the phone in its retracted state. Motorola's patent states a user would find this sensor centered near the bottom of the device.</p><p>The second is featured on the back of the phone. At the very least, such a design would give some additional purpose to the "backside" of the display when it's in a compact state.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:964px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.24%;"><img id="5i3vEidhciDNoMYPs2ZHR5" name="motorola-rizr-updated-patent-fingerprint-on-display" alt="An updated Motorola Rizr patent highlighting its double fingerprint-on-display (FOD) sensors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5i3vEidhciDNoMYPs2ZHR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="964" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MySmartPrice)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication dove into the patent further, but couldn't find any additional changes/updates. The post states the device's concept retains its 6.5-inch display when fully rolled out (5 inches when retracted).</p><p>Motorola showed off its rollable phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rizr-concept-mwc-2023">during MWC 2023</a>. During the event, users quickly discovered a hidden front-facing camera and speaker. The device offers a 5-inch display by default, but this display rolls back even further automatically when taking a selfie or on a call. Moreover, additional insight by Android Central during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-rizr-is-the-sharper-image-of-the-smartphone-world">a visit to Motorola's HQ in Chicago</a> showed that shifting its orientation (from portrait to landscape) during a video would see it extend on its own.</p><p>While it's a cool concept, the durability of such a device was called forward. The display isn't flush to the chassis and some parts seem far too exposed when fully rolled out. This is a concept, meaning things can always change — or it could never see a store shelf.</p><p>However, there's no hiding that OEMs are consistently seeking the "next big thing," like a rollable phone. Motorola has the Rizr still in its concept era and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-tablet-74-inch-screen">OPPO X 2021</a> took the spotlight in 2020. More importantly, Samsung was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">rumored to be <em>more </em>interested</a> in a rollable phone after Huawei's Mate XT (tri-fold) debuted.</p>

The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be getting the lion's share of the attention this time around, similar to what we saw earlier this year, but that doesn't mean the rest of the pack is any less exciting.</p><p>Quite the contrary, actually. It's actually been difficult narrowing it down to the three things I'm looking forward to the most, but I think I can be confident that the following list represents the best of what we're expecting to see from Samsung in January.</p>

<h2 id="round-yet-square-2">Round, yet square</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GbvfHgckkaBuPKC3tkr7XQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-case-vs-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-case-back" alt="Comparing a Fiberborne Galaxy S25 Ultra case with a Galaxy S24 Ultra case and the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbvfHgckkaBuPKC3tkr7XQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S Ultra series has had a bit of a controversial design over the past few years. The Galaxy S22 Ultra took many design cues from the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, carrying on the Note line in everything but the name. Largely, this design meant sharp, square corners and rounded edges.</p><p>I've never been a fan of this design and apparently someone else hasn't either, as Samsung may be switching things up this time arounf, quite literally flipping the squared and rounded edges according to all the rumors and leaks we've seen so far. That means the Galaxy S25 Ultra may have round corners and flat sides just as we saw Samsung do with the Galaxy S24 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">earlier this year</a>.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fiberborne.com/products/super-thin-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-aramid-fiber-magsafe"></a></p>

<p>I just received the first samples of Galaxy S25 Ultra cases from Fiberborne, the new name for the Thinborne aramid fiber cases we've regularly crowned as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-cases">best Galaxy S24 cases</a>.</p><p>These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fiberborne.com/products/super-thin-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-aramid-fiber-magsafe" target="_blank">new Fiberborne cases</a> aren't on sale quite yet, but they do reveal what may be the new design of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I'm mostly loving it. I'm not the biggest fan of phones with completely flat sides — I said as much in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro review</a> — but the rounded corners will certainly go a long way to making this phone more comfortable than the last three years of Galaxy S ultra models with their overly sharp corners.</p>

<p>Mobile processors have been pretty boring for the past few years now. While we've seen performance gains year over year, most of those improvements end up being lost to excess heat when playing games for more than 20 or 30 minutes. A lot of emphasis has been placed on AI processing because of it, but the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processors substantially improve all aspects of mobile processing without breaking a sweat.</p><p>Early results <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.antutu.com/doc/133085.htm">from benchmark company Antutu</a> paint the picture we were hoping to see. Not only does the Snapdragon 8 Elite run significantly faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, but it runs several degrees Celsius cooler, too.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/compare/8681992?baseline=8681811">Geekbench results</a> from the Xiaomi 15, one of the first phones to ship with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the new processor runs about 40% faster than the one that launched earlier this year. That's a huge improvement!</p><p>This level of speed has been achieved because Qualcomm was able to pack its brand new custom Oryon processing cores into the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the same exact cores it uses in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> that powers many popular Windows laptops in 2024.</p>

<p>One UI 7 won't be a Galaxy S25 exclusive but Samsung <em>is</em> using its next phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">to launch its latest OS update</a>. Built on Android 15, One UI 7 promises to be the biggest overhaul to Samsung's storied Android skin since the introduction of One UI exactly 6 years ago on November 7, 2018.</p><p>Aside from the potentially exciting visual refresh — which includes not only a fresh coat of paint but also some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">snazzy new animations</a> — Samsung looks to be including fantastic new AI features that will make your everyday smartphone experience all the better.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about a better spell checker or some niche AI feature you probably won't use more than once, though. I'm talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">smart notification upgrades</a> that summarize what's happening so you don't get overwhelmed and miss things.</p><p>I tend to leave my phone in my pocket or on a desk for a long time before picking it up, only to see a hundred notifications that quickly become too much to deal with. What happens then? I usually just hit clear all and figure it out later.</p><p>This new notification summary feature will help deliver quick, concise summaries of groups of notifications so I can stay in the know without feeling overwhelmed. That's the real AI upgrade I've been waiting for, and the phone's hardware will be perfectly equipped to handle these new AI features, especially with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>

<p>My three favorite things about the Galaxy S25 certainly sound compelling, but they allegedly come with a price hike that no one wants to pay. That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S24 Black Friday deals</a> come in. No matter what Samsung will be selling the Galaxy S25 for, it's impossible for the company to offer its phones at any better price than the Galaxy S24 is selling these days.</p><p>In just a few weeks, we'll be in the midst of Black Friday and all the crazy sales. Since the Galaxy S24 debuted 10 months ago, you know you'll be getting the best price possible on Samsung's 2024 phones so that they can make room for the 2025 models.</p><p>If price is a big concern in the coming months, it's probably best to stick with what's currently available, especially since Samsung offers seven years of software upgrades for its Galaxy S24 line. That means One UI 7 is the first of seven total OS updates that'll debut on the phones until support officially ends.</p><p>Getting a phone at a reduced price <em>and</em> getting seven years of guaranteed updates is a surefire way to ensure that you're getting the very best deal this year with no compromises.</p>

<ul><li>The CSA highlighted the arrival of its Matter 1.4 upgrade for smart homes.</li><li>The update adds support for more devices like water heaters and heat pumps, as well as improved thermostat support for preset modes.</li><li>Matter rolled out its 1.3 upgrade earlier this year, where it welcomed EV chargers and smart home appliances.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The CSA continues its mission to improve the connectivity of consumers' smart home devices as the latest major upgrade rolls out.</p><p>Yet again, the CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-4-enables-more-capable-smart-homes/">detailed a host of newly supported</a> smart home devices for the 1.4 update. According to the post, Matter connectivity now supports solar-powered devices such as inverters, individual and panel arrays, and hybrid solar/battery systems. Batteries (battery walls, storage units, etc.) are also said to be supported with the latest update.</p><p>In time for the colder months, the CSA states Matter welcomes Heat Pumps and Water Heaters. The post states that the connectivity's "energy management" capabilities should aid homeowners with (power) consumption forecasts alongside the ability to "adjust" its usage during peak hours. For the latter, the CSA says the 1.4 upgrade adds a new "Water Heater Mode Cluster." This is designed to bring a toggling feature for set schedules.</p><p>Moreover, thermostats receive support for scheduling and "preset modes." The CSA states that its supported preset modes include "home/away and vacation." The post adds that presets can be triggered via motion detection, calendar events, and integration with other devices.</p><p>The CSA highlights support for electric vehicle supply equipment and its "Device Energy Management" to help users optimize the energy usage of their smart home products.</p>

<p>Battery-powered devices receive enhancements to help "optimize" battery life and communication with switches, buttons, and sensors.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post states the 1.4 upgrade introduces better "Multi-Admin" support. The CSA informs users that this should help make management easier as it brings "single user consent" for devices. In short, homeowners can seamlessly connect new or existing smart home devices to "multiple ecosystems automatically."</p><p>The Alliance is also upgrading its Matter-certified HRAP devices to combine a home's Wi-Fi access point and Thread Border Router. The post states this is designed to strengthen the required infrastructure for other Matter products.</p><p>The 1.4 upgrade is available now; however, it may take a while before a given platform integrates it for users.</p><p>Matter's latest update is the second rollout in 2024, as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">1.3 upgrade arrived in May</a>. That update brought support and energy management controls for EV chargers alongside home appliances. Water management devices were also roped into the Matter connectivity push as the CSA included "leak and freeze detectors, rain sensors, and controllable water valves."</p><p>It's worth noting that Google was spotted preparing enhanced Matter-supported device controls <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/android-15-matter-thread-netowrk-support-previewed">over the Thread network</a>. Devices that contain the appropriate Thread radio may receive increased efficiency and "performance enhancements" through Android 15.</p>

<p>This model specifically, is powered by the Intel Core Ultra 5 115U, paired with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. Not to mention that if you decide to snag this deal, you'll also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> for 12 months. With this, you'll get 2TB of cloud storage, in addition to having access to Gemini in all of your Google services.</p><p>When it comes to the design, it's pretty much identical to Acer's previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Chromebook Spin models</a>. That includes being able to either prop it up with "Tent Mode," or flip the screen all the way around, to use the Spin 714 as a tablet paired with a USI stylus. The only downside here is that you'll need to pick up a compatible USI pen, as Acer doesn't include one.</p><p>Although the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 might lack the "pizazz" of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, that doesn't mean you should ignore it. This is still easily one of the best Chromebooks that money can buy, providing a near-perfect blend of sleek design with plenty of horsepower.</p><p>Recently, Google added even more fun with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">ChromeOS 130</a>. This update includes a variety of AI features, such as the Recorder app, Quick Insert, and so much more. There's even the new "Focus" option that lets you start a timer and work on a task without needing to worry about distractions.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening is the horror game I didn't know I needed. I say that because, first off, I'm not exactly a fan of the horror genre. I've enjoyed the occasional scary movie or game from time to time, but those are exceptions rather than the rule. I've also never really gotten into the Metro series despite enjoying the theme and the original release of Metro 2033.</p><p>But Metro Awakening is something special. It's a narrative-heavy, linear first-person shooter — just like the rest of the series — that had me hooked from the moment its clever intro began. It's also the first made-for-VR entry into the storied series, developed entirely by veteran VR developer Vertigo Games, the same company behind VR classics like Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall.</p><p>Despite being from a different developer, Metro Awakening feels incredibly similar to Metro 2033 in all the right ways. As the story goes, it takes place primarily in the metro train tunnels under a once great city, where you'll find yourself uncovering the horrors that both radioactivity and desperate humans created. It's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> I've ever played.</p>

<p>If you've played the Arizona Sunshine games or After the Fall, you'll immediately feel familiar with the mechanics in Metro Awakening. That's not to say things are identical — the dual backpack-based inventory system is a clever new design I haven't seen yet — but everything that's good about the company's previous apocalyptic shooters sits on display for players to experience in Metro Awakening.</p><p>Intuitive on-body inventory systems, where you can consistently depend on grabbing the same item every time you reach for it, make them feel as good as a hot bar in a flat-screen game.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is particularly important given the level of fear the game consistently holds you in, as you'll be able to make better split-second decisions because you won't be fumbling with an unreliable inventory system. Healing is always on your left hip, a pistol always on your right, and reaching into the pocket on your chest always delivers the proper ammo or refill for the weapon you're holding.</p><p>That is, of course, so long as you've been able to hold on to enough ammo to get you through the next section. One of Metro Awakening's biggest strengths is its consistent difficulty level, which is directly relative to how much ammo you're given between any of the game's encounters.</p><p>The first time you pull the hammer back and peer into the gun's body to make sure you still have a bullet in the chamber isn't just clutch. It's vital for immersion.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening's combat encounters are as often about taking the stealthy approach as they are about blindly shooting at unseen enemies like a character in one of Ridley Scott's Alien movies. Most encounters with humans give you the option to be stealthy — which I'll encourage you to use — in order to save up as much ammo for the next encounter as possible.</p><p>But every single encounter — even the ones that very obviously imply a stealthy approach is best — can be run through Rambo style. Enemies' weapons can be taken after they are downed, and while ammo in those weapons is always severely limited, they allow skilled players to hop from enemy to enemy and piggyback in creative ways. Cans and bottles can be brought from place to place and used to distract enemies, so you can use a stealthy melee attack to take them out.</p><p>The ability to act naturally in VR dawned on me during one early encounter. While running from a giant mutant rat, I grabbed a large sliding door and closed it three-quarters of the way, blocking the rat's entry and giving me enough space to blast it to smithereens.</p><p>There's no way to do this in a non-VR game, and it makes the game feel special and bespoke in a way that another flatscreen entry couldn't.</p>

<p>There was never a time in Metro Awakening's 12-hour campaign where I felt like I was repeating the same old situation over and over again. Each hallway, air vent, metro tunnel, or other space you walk through feels unique in a way that's rarely achieved outside of something as good as Metroid Prime. While this isn't a Metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination, the variety of locales and the compelling story kept me coming back to the game for more each day.</p><p>Metro Awakening has you playing the community's doctor whose eccentric wife seems to always cause problems. When she starts hearing the voice of your long-dead son in the steam pipes, you know something bad's about to happen. The rest of the journey will have you wondering if she's sane, prophetic, or maybe somewhere in between the two. Either way, you'll be venturing further than your character's hard past has ever gone before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD" name="metro-awakening-screenshot-02" alt="A screenshot of Metro Awakening taken on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmSprtaPc7XWtkK2taHUJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since many parts of the world you'll explore are radioactive, you'll need to occasionally put on a gas mask and keep track of how effective its filter is working. Finding and swapping out filters will let you explore these areas more, often helping you find survival supplies and a few collectible items. If there's any replayability in the game, it's for folks who love to re-experience specific events or to find all three postcards hidden in each chapter.</p><p>Despite not being a big fan of the horror genre, the macabre scenes depicted constantly throughout the game were fascinating in a way I didn't expect. Likewise, the horrifying creatures that had me jumping and blindly shooting were always interesting to encounter, and I regularly tried to find creative ways to dispatch them before they got too close.</p><p>While I wouldn't put Metro Awakening in the same general category as a horror game like Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife, there's no denying the importance of horror to the story and the overall atmosphere of the game. Even if you're not a fan of horror like me, I'd encourage you to try it. The Meta Quest store has a 2-hour return window, anyway, and you'll definitely get the feeling of the game in the first 30 minutes, let alone two hours.</p>

<p>If I had to name one specific critique of the Quest version of the game, it would be that I expected to see the game running at a higher resolution than it does. I used Quest Games Optimizer to boost the resolution to 130%, and it looked downright breathtaking at times, all without any noticeable performance hitches. Hopefully, Vertigo Games can patch in something like this soon.</p><p>The VR community has had its share of ups and downs with big releases this year, but this last quarter has proven to pack a serious punch that gives me high hopes for the future of big-name VR games. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> sits firmly at the top as game of the year, although Metro Awakening has already making me question which title will get the crown at the end of the year.</p>

<p>I bought three units of the Shield TV Pro 2019, and use the streaming box exclusively in my house. It has the best hardware of any streaming device, and thanks to the generous port selection, you can easily attach external storage. It also has the best AI-assisted upscaling, and if you have SD or older content, it looks great on the Shield TV Pro. As it launched it 2019, it misses out on AV1 decode, but that's a problem only with YouTube, and even though it's significantly costlier, the Shield TV Pro is the one I'd pick.</p></p>

That said, I like the aggressive design of the Shield TV Pro, and it has LED lighting as well.</p><p>I also like the wedge-style Shield TV Pro remote. It has backlit buttons and a great in-hand feel, and it is built to last — the remote took dozens of tumbles in the last five years, and it is still going strong.</p>

<p>The Google TV Streamer comes with the latest Google TV build, and you get useful extras. There&apos;s a dedicated smart home hub — similar to the Google Home dashboard — that lets you control smart home devices, and view footage from any security cameras.</p><p>There are no issues in daily use either; the Google TV Streamer has a smooth interface with no noticeable lag. That&apos;s a big deal in and of itself, because most streaming boxes tend to be laggy at times. Thankfully, that just isn&apos;t an issue here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-4.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aBaSEzPF8Lyx6K9LjRvNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about no lag, the Shield TV Pro continues to set the standard in this category. Even though the hardware is old at this point, there&apos;s absolutely no lag or stutter in regular use, and the device still gets regular software updates with system tweaks.</p><p>That said, the Shield TV Pro is still on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-review">Android 11</a>, and it isn&apos;t likely to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>-based Google TV. I see this as a good thing as it means I get the ability to disable the Google TV interface entirely and use the older Android TV skin, so this isn&apos;t an issue in my own use case.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MDPwVpKzcsN8sxueXDcnhN" name="google-tv-streamer-review-17.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with Android figure and remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MDPwVpKzcsN8sxueXDcnhN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google TV Streamer is powered by MediaTek&apos;s MT8696 platform, and it comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The increased memory and storage absolutely make a difference, and it&apos;s great to see Google make the sensible choice in this regard and not shortchange users.</p><p>You also get 4K playback with Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG. What I like is that the device has an HDMI 2.1 port at the back, and while you don&apos;t get any additional ports other than a USB-C power connector and Ethernet, you can add storage drives by using a USB-C hub.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-2.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield TV Pro against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3aiKBJ35Kmd5QLGhiYzw5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Shield TV Pro continues to have the best hardware, with the Tegra platform still holding its own. You get two USB-A ports at the back as well, and an SD card slot on the side, so if you need an easy way to connect external storage, the Shield TV Pro is the obvious choice.</p><p>While the Google TV Streamer gets a lot right, it doesn&apos;t include Wi-Fi 6, and that&apos;s annoying. It isn&apos;t a huge deal as you still get a reliable signal, but Wi-Fi 6 has inherent advantages with latency and device congestion, and you miss out on those benefits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf" name="google-tv-streamer-with-usb-c-hub-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer with DockCase USB-C Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFbWonPbQGcRNDiUx9v6jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to daily use, both the Google TV Streamer and Shield TV Pro do a great job. There&apos;s no issue with HDR content or installing utilities like Plex, Kodi, and Jellyfin, and I prefer the Shield TV Pro as it allows me to stream games with relative ease.</p><p>The only quibble with the Shield TV Pro is that it doesn&apos;t have AV1, so you don&apos;t get HDR videos in YouTube. This isn&apos;t an issue with other streaming platforms, and as the Google TV Streamer is newer, it has the codec, so you don&apos;t miss out in this regard.</p>

<p>When you look at the $100 price, it&apos;s obvious that the Google TV Streamer is a terrific all-round product. It may not have some of the more advanced options, but as a mainstream Google TV Streamer, it absolutely nails the essentials.</p><p>The Shield TV Pro may be older, but it still costs $199, or twice as much as the Google TV Streamer. It has much better hardware, and if I had to pick one, I&apos;d go with the Shield TV Pro — it just does a better job catering to my usage needs. But if you need the best value, the Google TV streamer is almost as good, and that&apos;s an achievement.</p>

<ul><li>According to research firm Statcounter, Google Pixel market share more than doubled in the span of a month.</li><li>The recent spike in Pixel market share can likely be attributed to the success of the Google Pixel 9 series.</li><li>Additionally, Counterpoint reports Google phone shipments increased 20% year-over-year  on the back of the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>, which includes four phones at various price points, received rave reviews from the media when it launched in August. However, that isn't always indicative of how a lineup of flagship phones will resonate with consumers. A variety of factors can determine whether a phone is successful, even if the hardware and software are both excellent.</p><p>Well, a pair of reports from two research firms suggest that the Google Pixel 9 was a hit, however you look at it. Counterpoint Research's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/" target="_blank">results</a> from the third quarter of 2024 revealed that Google smartphone shipments increased 20% year-over-year. For reference, the Pixel 9 series debuted nearly two months earlier in 2024 than the Pixel 8 series did in 2023. Google's shipments represented just four percent of phones shipped overall in Q3 2024.</p><p>“The Pixel 9 series had a staggard launch this year starting at the end of August with the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro XL, followed by the 9 Pro and 9 Pro Fold in the beginning of September," said Maurice Klaehne, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, in a press release. "We expect GenAI smartphones to perform well in Q4 as more software updates for both iOS and Android get released.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LHz4r4kjv3nPsuHeqarvFP" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHz4r4kjv3nPsuHeqarvFP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Counterpoint also revealed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, the biggest of Google's new flagships, was in the top ten of the best-selling premium phones in Q3 2024.</p><p>However, it's Statcounter's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/north-america" target="_blank">market share figures</a> from October 2024 that give us a better idea of how the Pixel 9 series is performing. Google's mobile vendor market share in North America is 12.4% as of October 2024, which is the first time the company's smartphone market share crossed into double-digit territory. More importantly, it spiked from 4.76% in September 2024 to 12.4% in October 2024. That kind of jump in the span of a month signals that the Pixel 9 series is finding immense success.</p><p>Google's apparent winner in the Pixel 9 is great news for Android as a whole. There is growing skepticism that Samsung, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">recently apologized for failing to innovate</a>, can disrupt Apple's stronghold on the premium phone market in North America. The market share spike Google earned last month could be a reason for optimism that it, not Samsung, can challenge the iPhone.</p>
