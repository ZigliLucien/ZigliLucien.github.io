<p>If past years are any indication, we can expect the Galaxy S25 series to be revealed sometime in mid-January with a street date set for a week or two after the announcement. The flagship lineup is likely to include at least three phones ‚Äî the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra ‚Äî all packed to the brim with the latest Snapdragon processors and Galaxy AI features.¬†</p><p>There&apos;s no doubt that the phones will be impressive, but there&apos;s good reason to expect that they won&apos;t be <em>dramatically</em> different from the S24 series. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> released this year all come with seven years of OS/security updates and deliver outstanding AI-powered performance, and Samsung typically focuses more on careful refinement than dramatic reinventions with its new releases.¬†</p><p>So how badly do you <em>really</em> need the latest devices on the street? The choice is yours, but if you&apos;re looking for a great holiday gift, I wouldn&apos;t snooze on this S24 Ultra deal.</p><p>In conclusion..¬†</p><p><strong>‚úÖI recommend this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re shopping for the holidays and you want an amazing Android phone at a stellar discount (even if it&apos;s going to be considered last-gen very soon); you want a phone with years of software support, excellent cameras, and AI features.¬†</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>you want the latest and greatest from Samsung and don&apos;t mind waiting until January; you&apos;re looking for a good trade-in opportunity or carrier deal.¬†</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>OnePlus has launched a new program offering a lifetime warranty for all of its devices affected by the green line issue.</li><li>OnePlus is also improving AMOLED durability with a new PVX edge-seal to block moisture and oxygen, and displays now go through 180+ tests to prevent green lines.</li><li>The lifetime warranty is currently available in India, while U.S. and Europe users get the standard one- or two-year warranty.</li></ul>

<p>Many OnePlus users have faced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/green-line-of-death">stubborn green line issue</a> on their phone displays. In response, OnePlus has rolled out a program to fix the problem for good.</p><p>Older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus flagship devices</a> have been making waves lately, but not for the best reasons‚Äîa pesky ‚Äúgreen line‚Äù display glitch has been causing headaches for users. The issue, which is common on OLED models, gained traction last year as more cases piled up.</p><p>To tackle the problem, OnePlus started offering free screen replacements under certain conditions. Now, the company has taken it up a notch with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1743847105291616260" target="_blank">‚ÄúGreen Line Worry-Free Solution‚Äù program</a>, promising lifetime coverage for all devices facing this annoying problem.</p><p>The warranty covers all OnePlus devices, old and new. To tackle the green line issue, OnePlus has laid out a three-step plan, with the highlight being the lifetime warranty solution. The company explained that the problem isn‚Äôt tied to one cause but stems from a mix of factors.</p><p>In response, OnePlus is upgrading its AMOLED screens with an Enhanced Bonding Layer. This PVX edge seal blocks moisture and oxygen, keeping your display sharper and lasting longer.</p><p>Additionally, OnePlus' AMOLED displays now go through over 180 intense tests, simulating extreme real-world conditions, to keep those green lines at bay and set a new standard for reliability.</p><p>The green line issue seems to be more of a problem in India, so OnePlus is offering the lifetime warranty there for now, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-lifetime-warranty-green-line-issue/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>. In the U.S. and Europe, though, it‚Äôs still the regular one- or two-year warranty, depending on where you are.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt the first time OnePlus has stepped in to fix the green line issue. In the past, it offered discount vouchers to some affected users in India as a way to make up for the problem.</p><p>OnePlus also clarified that if replacement parts for older devices aren‚Äôt available, the company might offer upgrade vouchers to help users grab a newer OnePlus model.</p>

<p>Oh the woes of living on the edge. Earlier this week, Samsung started rolling out the first One UI 7 beta. Naturally, it's first being made available to those that own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> flagship models (sorry, S24 FE.)</p><p>However, when the rumor mill picked up steam leading up to the official announcement, I was hoping to spend my weekend messing around with One UI 7 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The announcement came and went, and there was no mention of the Fold 6 being included in the beta program.</p><p>In fact, there wasn't any mention of Samsung's flagship foldable phones at all. Instead, they've just been roped in with the rest of the company's lineup, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-starts-to-roll-out-in-select-markets">Samsung stating</a> "In line with Samsung‚Äôs commitment to extend its OS upgrade policy, the update will gradually roll out to other Galaxy devices."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y25BmS6tkpUTKKSGXq4LLD" name="one-ui-7-beta-features-galaxy-s24-ultra" alt="One UI 7 features on the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y25BmS6tkpUTKKSGXq4LLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn't <em>actually</em> expect the Galaxy Z Fold 6 to be included in the One UI 7 beta program. Especially considering how many times <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">rumors</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-uis-next-release-is-delayed-and-samsung-wants-it-on-your-tvs-and-appliances">have</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-pushed-back-again">surfaced</a> about Samsung needing to delay the rollout. It's apparent that this isn't just your run-of-the-mill update, as more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features are on the way, along with the new "Now Bar" and improved camera controls.</p><p>Obviously, Samsung is going to prioritize its slab phones over foldables, but there's just something that leaves me feeling a bit disappointed.</p><p>We're heading into year 6 of the foldable phone experiment, with Samsung arguably providing the most useful and reliable software experience of them all. So why is it that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a> aren't even mentioned in a footnote for being included or next in line?</p>

<p>Yet again, it feels as if foldable phone enjoyers are being treated like second-class citizens who have a first-class budget. Samsung has made it abundantly clear that it is more than willing to ship out the same phone for three years in a row, raking in profits and then apologizing for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">failing to innovate</a>." Only to release a phone with the changes we've been wanting, but limit it to just one specific region.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> are a niche product category, I get it. And I know that within that niche, there's an even smaller group that would entertain the idea of installing beta software. But here's my counterargument ‚Äî if I already know that I'm part of an experiment, what makes you think that I wouldn't want to be included in another one?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA" name="Android-16-Pixel9PF" alt="The logo for Android 16 on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLCKfeSHeDZWCUwT9QjhHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been more than two years since I wrote about my experiences living in the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beta-apps-anonymous">beta lifestyle</a>," but nothing's changed. Well, I take that back. The devices and some of the apps have changed, but everything else I expressed in that article still rings true.</p><p>Some of it definitely has to do with FOMO, as there are some intriguing additions coming to One UI 7. However, there's also a sneaking suspicion that this might be a sign of things to come. Not that Samsung is going to ditch its foldable phones, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">we might be heading for a rough patch</a> with One UI software updates.</p><p>We've had the stable version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> since mid-October, yet here we are almost two months later, and there's no clear timeline for when it will come to the Fold. And if Samsung is having this much of an issue already, what does that say for older models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> or even the Galaxy S23 Ultra?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R58kspU9haSWsVA2tVErqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was going to just bypass the money argument until I realized that the $850 Galaxy S24 gets a taste before the $1,800 Z Fold 6. Yes, I know that I answered the reason as to why this is the case already, but my point still stands.</p><p>It's not like we're talking about a company with limited budgets and resources that might issue one or two updates, six months after the release. This is Samsung. You know, the company that generated almost $60 BILLION in revenue in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">Q3 2024</a>. In my mind, there's really no excuse for any of its flagship phones to be left behind, even if they aren't as popular or selling as well.</p><p>Hell, Google not only included the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer Preview</a> release, but it's also available for the original Pixel Fold. Sure, some features are bound to be missing, but that's to be expected given that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-hope-google-doesnt-limit-assistant-with-bard">Google fumbled the release</a> anyway.</p><p>The point is that if Google can do it, why can't Samsung? If it wanted to, Samsung could, and for reasons that are below my pay grade to know, chose not to.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors from Weibo claim Xiaomi has "postponed" the launch of its planned 15 Ultra.</li><li>The tipster doesn't suggest a reason why; however, the post notes a recent listing that shows it will feature 90W fast charging and satellite call/text capabilities.</li><li>The Xiaomi 15 was spotted at the FCC recently, signaling its upcoming global launch, but the alleged Ultra delay could effect it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's an Ultra-level device set to grace Xiaomi's latest series; however, a new rumor claims it's a bit further away than previously anticipated.</p><p>According to Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P3vA3qgZg?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), Xiaomi has supposedly "postponed" the launch of the 15 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/12/xiaomi-15-ultra-wont-launch-as-soon-as-expected.html">Android Headlines</a>). Despite the curiosity about this (alleged) delay, the tipster did not suggest <em>when </em>consumers could see the device launching.</p><p>In a subsequent post, DCS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P3pSzsxus">spotted a website certification</a> listing for the Xiaomi 15 Ultra.</p><p>The listing shows the phone will debut with 90W fast charging, which is likely the strength of its wired method. The publication adds that the device may arrive with a battery within the ~5,400mAh to ~5,800mAh range and with the potential for 50W wireless charging. The listing DCS discovered included connectivity support, which leans on satellite capabilities.</p><p>The listing shows the phone will support satellite communications via calls and texts.</p><p>The certification didn't point to any sort of launch, meaning we'll have to play things by ear as 2025 rolls in.</p><p>Xiaomi's 15 and 15 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">debuted in China</a> late in October with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. The devices feature a flat design with rounded corners for an easy handheld experience. The Pro delivers a 6.73-inch LTPO AMOLED 120Hz display and a large 6,100mAh battery. This phone also borrows the same camera from the Xiaomi 14 Ultra: a Sony IMX858 telephoto lens with 5x zoom.</p><p>Speaking of the 14 Ultra, the current 15 Ultra battery rumors claim that a ~400mAh or ~800mAh upgrade is in the cards for its previous 5,000mAh.</p><p>In other news, discussions have been heating up about the Xiaomi 15 series ever since it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-preps-global-debut-8-elite-fcc-listing">spotted at the FCC</a>. The listing showcased Xiaomi's intent to provide the global phone with HyperOS 2.0 and two RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, and 12/512GB. It seems likely that the base 15 will debut without the 15 Pro, which would stick to Xiaomi's previous behavior.</p><p>Moreover, the publication wonders if the rumored delay of the 15 Ultra will effect the base model's global appearance. If so, speculation states we could see the phones in February, but there's nothing set just yet. However, a February launch isn't that crazy as Xiaomi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-launch-and-14-ultra">did just that earlier this year</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google has started rolling out its "help me create" Gemini feature in the Home app through its Public Preview.</li><li>The experimental feature lets users quickly make an automation for lights, security, and more through the AI model, Gemini.</li><li>Google states this is appearing "gradually" for enrolled Public Preview testers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google highlighted an upcoming smart home addition in November and that's finally arriving for (a few) enrolled testers.</p><p>According to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15684131#zippy=">support page</a>, Google has started rolling out its new automation creation feature for Home in Public Preview. Per the explainer, AI is at the core of this feature as Google states Gemini enters to bring a "help me create" prompt. Essentially, users can control their smart home devices and automation with ease and the potential for more customization.</p><p>Since it's rolling out, enrolled testers can open the Google Home app and find the  Automation button (with a starry icon), tap "Add" and, finally, "help me create." Google states users can get going by using their voice or by writing to the AI in English. However, the company states that you will find Gemini's suggestions for what to automate.</p><p>You can select one of these if you prefer and find the option to edit them to better fit your needs.</p><p>Users can then tap "create" and wait a few moments while the AI does its thing. After, there will be an option to "rate" or save the automation, as well as an "Ask again" button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:954px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="nnhyxeVGMUZKwzpqxEkmbc" name="google-home-help-me-create-public-preview" alt="Google Home's "help me create" enters the Public Preview." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnhyxeVGMUZKwzpqxEkmbc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="954" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to doing it manually, the post highlights the necessity for three components in "help me create." Those include "Starters," which lets users tell the app/AI "when to begin" alongside "Conditions" for "optional restrictions" when it begins. Then, you have the "Action," which is what <em>should </em>be done.</p><p>Additionally, Google is still working on expanding its device support. There's another page that details which starters, conditions, and actions the prompt supports. Also, "help me create" is stated to only work with Nest cameras "setup or migrated to" the Google Home app.</p><p>This "help me create" feature is rolling out to "eligible users" who've enrolled in Google Home's Public Preview. It seems that only a few are seeing this today (Dec 6), which is also something the company notes. The post states that everyone won't see it simultaneously as it appears "gradually."</p><p>Google teased this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-integrates-gemini-for-smarter-home-automation">new experimental feature</a> during its fall update in early November. The company highlighted a few of its uses, such as the ability for users to automate security, health/wellness, home convenience, and more. That early post said "help me create" would be available "later this year;" however, its arrival in the Public Preview will assist in ironing out any issues before that happens.</p><p>If you're interested in testing "help me create," the post states you can tap the Public Preview icon (it looks like a beaker) and tap the experimental AI features. After agreeing to the terms, the experiment should toggle "on" and the feature should appear shortly after.</p>

<p>Google's December patch arrives shortly after the debut of its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">feature drop for Pixels</a>. These updates will likely arrive close together when updating/installing on your phone. More specifically, the latest feature drop brings new goodies to Gemini on Pixel like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">Spotify extension</a>, calling/texting capabilities for the AI, and "Saved info with Gemini."</p><p>The Pixel 9 series exclusively received new additions like a revamped Call Screen powered by Gemini Nano for screening calls. The Pixel Screenshots app also got upgraded with better organization and the option of using it in Google Wallet to save cards like your driver's license, boarding pass, and more.</p><p>Android in general received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-spruces-up-android-with-6-new-features-improving-gemini-accessibility-and-sharing">a major update</a>, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-december-feature-drop-for-pixel-watch-lets-you-peek-at-nest-cameras-from-your-wrist">Pixel Watch and Nest</a>.</p><p>Google's patch notes for its security update reiterated the decision to grant the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, and Pixel Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">two more years of OS updates</a>. This now makes it so the oldest of the three series is eligible for Android 16, which should arrive much earlier in 2025.</p>

The AI-powered chatbot can replace your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, have conversational chats with you in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, and even analyze your documents. However, if you're a fan of using Gemini's voice assistant functionality, you might be wondering how you can change its voice to match your preferences.</p><p>Luckily, you can do just that in the Gemini app, and we're going to show you how in this guide.</p>

<p>There's only one way to change how Gemini sounds, and that's via the Gemini app. However, this setting changes a lot more than just the voice used in the app. It will also change the voice used for Gemini Live, the Gemini assistant, and all apps that integrate with Gemini. For example, if you tap <strong>Listen</strong> beside a written Gemini response, it'll speak using the voice you select in the Gemini app.</p><p>There are 10 voice options available: Vega, Ursa, Pegasus, Nova, Eclipse, Lyra, Orbit, Dipper, Capella, and Orion. You can pick one of those voices if your first language in Android is a supported language. Supported languages for Gemini voices are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Arabic</li><li>Bengali</li><li>Danish</li><li>Dutch</li><li>English</li><li>French</li><li>German</li><li>Gujarati</li><li>Hindi</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Indonesian</li><li>Italian</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Kannada</li><li>Latvian</li><li>Lithuanian</li><li>Malayalam</li><li>Marathi</li><li>Norwegian</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Romanian</li><li>Slovenian</li><li>Spanish</li><li>Swahili</li><li>Swedish</li><li>Tamil</li><li>Telugu</li><li>Turkish</li><li>Ukrainian</li><li>Urdu</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul>
<h2 id="how-to-change-a-voice-in-the-gemini-app-2">How to change a voice in the Gemini app</h2>
<p>It only takes a few taps to change the Gemini app's voice. You can listen to all the options before making your selection, and can always go back to change it later. Here's how to do it.</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gemini app</strong> on your Android phone.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>Profile picture</strong> or <strong>initial</strong> in the top right corner of the app.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Gemini's voice</strong>.</p><p>4. Swipe left or right to <strong>hear a voice</strong>, and stop at the one you like.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>Back</strong> button to select a voice.</p>

<p>Now that Gemini is a significant part of Android, you may want to change its voice to match your own, or to simply find one you like the sound of. Voice assistants have had the ability to change voices for years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-voice-google-assistant-your-phone">including the Google Assistant</a>. So, it's natural for you to want to change Gemini to match your preferences, too.</p>

<ul><li>Strava's Year in Sport 2024 report was published on Wednesday, showing users' fitness trends worldwide.</li><li>The report shows trends for 135 million active Strava users, including a rise in group activities.</li><li>The "Apple Watch Series" and "Apple Watch SE" were the two top tracking devices for runs, with the Garmin Forerunner 245 in third place.</li><li>Two Garmin Edge bike computers topped the list for tracked Ride activities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strava is one of the most popular social fitness apps in the world, and its annual Year in Sport trends provide some interesting insight into the trends of hundreds of millions of athletes worldwide. So it was fascinating to see that Apple had dethroned Garmin as the most popular running watch on the platform.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-releases-annual-year-in-sport-trend">2024 report</a>, the Apple Watch Series and Apple Watch SE were the number one and two gear for all runners, followed by the Garmin Forerunner 245. Last year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watch-from-2015-most-popular-on-strava">8-year-old Garmin Forerunner 235 was the most popular</a> worldwide for runners, while the Forerunner 245 was the most-used watch in the U.S.</p><p>This year's report solely showed global data, but Apple Watches are very popular in the U.S., so they likely would have won regardless. Garmin still dominated with its acclaimed Edge 530 and 830 bike computers, with the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt V1 ‚Äî the top 2023 bike computer in the U.S. ‚Äî coming in third.</p><p>Outside of gear, the report showed a major increase in running clubs and group runs of 10+, with women in particular joining Strava clubs 89% more in 2024 than in 2023.</p><p>The Strava Year in Sport 2024 report showed that runners' median activity pace was 10:15 per mile; the 2023 report showed lower median numbers for most generations aside from Boomers, so either people slowed down globally in 2024 or older runners skewed the median.</p><p>For other activities, the median pace or speed was 12.1mph for cyclists, 19:40 min/mile for walkers, and 22:06 min/mile for hikers. Now we know what pace to beat to be "better than average."</p><p>Interestingly, Strava says that 72% of uploaded activities come from the mobile app. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> are the overwhelming favorite for marathoners and half marathoners, one in four 5K runners use their phones, perhaps using an external HRM like the Polar H10 or else ignoring heart rate and other wrist-based data entirely.</p>
<h2 id="why-apple-suddenly-beat-garmin-for-runners-worldwide-2">Why Apple suddenly beat Garmin for runners worldwide</h2>
<p>As someone who covers running watches extensively, I believe there are a few reasons why Apple suddenly dominated the Strava gear category for runners.</p><p>The first is about simple categorization and raw sales: Apple consistently sells about 20% of all wearables worldwide (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/wearablevendor">IDC</a>), and all Apple "Series" watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series 9</a> or Series X are categorized as the same "Apple Watch" on Strava, which lets years of different Apple Watch generations tag-team to take the top slot. The same goes for the two generations of Apple SEs.</p><p>(As much as I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">loved the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> for its accuracy and ultra-bright, massive squircle display, I don't think it's counted in the same category.)</p><p>Garmin watches all log activities as their own distinct devices, and we've seen five new Garmin Forerunner watches in the last couple of years. Forerunners have excellent longevity ‚Äî hence why the 2015 Forerunner 235 and 2019 Forerunner 245 kept their Strava crowns for so long ‚Äî but I suspect many of these loyal Garmin fans gave in and upgraded to the Forerunner 165, 255, 265, 955, or 965 in recent years ‚Äî or tried <em>other</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> brands like the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>So it's likely that Garmin's share of Strava runners hasn't faded below Apple, but rather that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a>'s training load tools or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>'s budget-priced perks tempted 235 and 245 users to swap, and each watch is claiming a distinct portion of the Strava user base.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rJ8f5hRPohAu9FkXt6RHaT" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-activity.jpeg" alt="A hiking activity on the Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rJ8f5hRPohAu9FkXt6RHaT.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, Apple has to receive at least some credit for this newfound Strava dominance, because it has seriously emphasized improving its running software over the last few generations.</p><p>It started with watchOS 9 in 2022, when Apple let runners see heart rate zones, running power, cadence, or elevation during a workout; race their past route times; and receive accurate track data using an Apple Maps database of public tracks. Garmin already had all this and more, but Apple closed the gap.</p><p>Most recently with watchOS 11, Apple added 7-day and 28-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> insights in graph form, showing if you're overtraining or slacking off compared to your past efforts, so you get fitter without straining too hard and hurting yourself. You can't see specific training load numbers or aerobic/anaerobic breakdowns like Garmin offers, but it's a streamlined metric for new-ish runners.</p><p>Even if "serious runners" tend to use Garmin watches with better battery life, Apple is cornering the market on casual couch-to-5K runners trying to get fit and lose weight. Strava itself said in the press release that "5k runners tended to opt for an Apple Watch, while the Garmin Forerunner was more popular for longer distances."</p><p>Basically, Apple is democratizing running insights, making them available for people who aren't sure if they're ready to commit to a specialized fitness watch. So even though I use Garmin watches most frequently, I think Apple swooping in to claim the top Strava crown is an awesome development, because it means more types of people are falling in love with running (or at least fighting through the anguish to get fit).</p><p>The same likely applies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> owners now that Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">makes running more of a priority</a> ‚Äî even if they have much smaller Strava numbers than Apple Watch owners.</p>
