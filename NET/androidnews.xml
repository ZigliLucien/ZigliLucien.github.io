For a limited time, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/6580484.p?skuId=6580484" target="_blank"><strong>save $300 on the 2024 Motorola Edge at Best Buy</strong></a> when you let them activate it for you, or save $200 when you connect it to a carrier yourself.</p><p>With 256GB of storage, a 6.6-inch AMOLED screen that's easy to look at, and an excellent battery life, the new Motorola Edge offers a solid (if a bit basic) smartphone experience — especially at this particular price point. Of course, there are plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dont-wait-for-black-friday-best-buy-just-launched-a-huge-sale-on-motorola-phones">early Black Friday Motorola deals</a> to consider, but if you had your eye on the Edge (2024), this is a great opportunity.</p>

This Motorola phone is a pretty basic offering from the company, though it also features a good-looking overall design with an anti-slip vegan leather back and a vivid AMOLED display. Plus, it comes with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and the user-friendly Hello UI, offering a great affordable pick for most casual phone users.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-256GB-Camera-Midnight/dp/B0D2JB6HP5" target="_blank">Amazon - $349.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Straight-Talk-Motorola-Moto-Edge-5G-256GB-Gray-Prepaid-Smartphone-Locked-to-Straight-Talk/6515767297" target="_blank">Walmart - $249.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2024-256gb-unlocked-midnight-blue/6580484.p?skuId=6580484" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1033116b-e16b-48b8-8048-0cc5ab15f4d8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Motorola Edge (2024):" data-dimension48="Motorola Edge (2024):" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a top priority for your phone needs; you've liked other Motorola phones with Hello UI; you need a phone with 256GB of storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a phone with super-powerful performance; you'd rather spend a little more money on a better set of cameras; you prefer a phone with several years of software updates.</p><p>This year's Motorola Edge effort was nothing too groundbreaking, but it's got a few things that people like. For one, the 6.6-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate is great, and it's also fairly easy on the eyes compared to some competitors around this price.</p><p>This phone comes with 256GB of storage, 68W charging speeds, and over a day of battery life. Still, for each upside, there are also a couple of downsides that may or may not matter to you.</p><p>The Edge only comes with two years of software updates, unlike many competitors, which offer four or more. Additionally, performance is lacking, as backed by the 2.4GHz Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor, and the cameras are simply nothing to write home about.</p><p>All in all, the 2024 Motorola Edge is a decent effort for the cost, especially if you like the premium-feeling design and vegan leather backing. Those in need of a peak-level performance phone, however, will likely not be satisfied with the Motorola Edge—or most other phones at this price level.</p><p>You can also find several of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> across a range of prices, if you'd rather go in a different direction.</p>

<hr>
<p>Polar is launching a new sporty smartwatch that builds on its stylish craft with the robustness you'd expect from a fitness partner.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/blog/introducing-polar-vantage-m3/">a press release</a>, Polar debuted the Vantage M3 smartwatch, a sporty alternate following the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Vantage V3</a>. The M3 features a 1.28-inch AMOLED display to replace Polar's old MIP screen. The company states this upgraded touchscreen should provide users with a more vibrant screen that retains its clarity in outdoor conditions. Users can also enable the M3's AOD (always-on display mode) for workout stats at a glance.</p><p>Gorilla Glass protects the M3's display for an added layer of protection against nicks and scratches.</p><p>The post reiterates the 2023 launch of the Polar Elixir biosensor, which is featured on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-grit-x2-pro-launch">the Grit X2 Pro</a>. The company states consumers interested in this "next-gen" sensor fusion platform can experience it on its sporty M3. The back of the device is where the magic happens as the M3 catalogs your heart rate with its 4th-gen OHR sensor. SpO2 levels are made readily available alongside skin temperature readings.</p><p>Additionally, Polar states users have an on-wrist ECG by placing a finger on the M3's button. The device requires 30 seconds before delivering its heart analytics.</p><p>Polar states those looking to stay active will find the M3 loaded with over 150 sports profiles, as well.</p>

<p>Sleep tracking capabilities are the other side of the M3, as the post states it delivers SleepWise, Sleep Plus Stages, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/smart-coaching/nightly-recharge">Nightly Recharge</a>. The latter is Polar's "overnight recovery measurement." According to the company, this feature lets the M3 inform you how well you've rested/recovered from the previous day's shenanigans.</p><p>What's more, Polar states it's provided the Vantage M3 with on-wrist map navigation capabilities. The watch contains a dual-frequency GPS, which should deliver a more accurate telling of your current location. The M3 features a full-color map experience, meaning users will find an "accurate" visual representation of the surrounding buildings, streets, places, and more.</p><p>The company adds that users can combine Komoot with the M3 for "turn-by-turn guidance."</p><p>Other specifications include the M3's 32GB of storage. Moreover, the watch contains a 310mAh battery. Polar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/vantage/m3">states the device</a> can last up to seven days in "smartwatch mode" or 30 hours in "training mode."</p><p>The Polar M3 is available today (Oct 23) in Greige Sand and Night Black. Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/vantage/m3">pick up the device</a> for $399.</p>

<p>The world of e-readers expands as Boox debuts a trio of new ePaper devices for book lovers.</p><p>Today (Oct 23), the company published a press release highlighting three e-readers, beginning with the 2024 Palma 2. Boox states the pocket-sized Palma 2 is a device for a "mindful lifestyle." Users will find the same 6.13-inch  300 PPI E Ink Carta 1200 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">its predecessor</a> from 2023.</p><p>The Palma 2 features Boox Super Refresh technology, which makes for a quicker device. Additionally, the company implemented an octa-core CPU to help users easily manage "multiple tasks." The latest phone-sized reader delivers Android 13 out of the box. It even comes pre-installed with the Google Play Store, meaning users can grab some of their favorite apps.</p><p>Boox states the Palma 2 offers several tools to help make reading more memorable for study and reflection. The device comes with NeoReader, a native Boox reading app that lets users highlight text, annotate, and translate. Boox adds users will also find the Boox AI assistant to help create a list or explain what a book sentence could mean.</p><p>Another highlight of the Palma 2 is the addition of a fingerprint reader. Boox states the fingerprint scanner is woven into the power button for an extra layer of security.</p>

<p>The "smart button" on the side of the Palma 2 lets users assign different functions to it as a shortcut. Boox states the button works in three ways: short press, long press, and double tap. Users can assign its screenshot feature or surface its AI by assigning them to one of the three functions for easy use. "Flexible widgets" and gestures make navigating the Palma 2 seamless when on the go.</p><p>Whether you're downloading a few apps or storing books, the Palma 2 delivers 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Moreover, users can toss in a microSD card for more room.</p><p>Like the 2023 edition, the Palma 2 contains a "durable" 3,950mAh battery with a USB-C charging port. The small phone-like device can repel "unexpected spills and splashes."</p><p>Consumers will find Boox Palma 2 in white and black. The device is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2">for pre-order</a> today (Oct 23) for $279. Boox adds that there are a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2#:~:text=Elegance%20Encased%2C%20Built%20for%20Versatility">flip-fold cases</a> for aesthetic and protective purposes.</p>

<p>Following the Palma 2 is the company's Note Air4 C. According to the post, the Note Air4 C delivers an "improved" 10.3-inch color ePaper display over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair3?srsltid=AfmBOooVwZImKxk_INRIGmQDMFKkzfy4xhKKBPQwDWu_aW2aqLkMgIrq">the Note Air3 C</a>. Boox states it's worked to enhance the tablet's Kaleido 3 color e-ink screen so it can deliver "brighter" backgrounds, contrast for eye comfort, and encourage an "engaging visual experience."  The Note Air4 C's display features a faster refresh rate and response time when tapping or writing.</p><p>The Note Air4 C's design remains close to its predecessor. Boox highlights the tablet's 5.8mm profile and light 420g weight.</p><p>With creativity at its core, the Note Air4 C lets artists pick between templates, brushes, layers, and AI-backed "Smart Scribe" tools. Boox added a new "Shape" tool for those looking to clean up their artwork, which may pair well with its lasso tool for moving design elements. Elsewhere, users can make notes on their artwork and quickly "link" them all with the new link tool.</p><p>The Note Air4 C's Android 13 OS and the octa-core CPU help with most of the heavy lifting. Boox states it has improved the CPU performance of the tablet by ~50% and its implementation of BSR technology aids its display's refresh rate.</p>

<p>The Note Air4 C is also a good reading buddy as Boox states users will find preset appearance choices to "improve readability." Like the Palma 2, the Note Air4 C makes tools like highlighting, creating annotations, and more freely available when reading documents, newspapers, and books. Moreover, users can switch between light or dark modes when reading. Multitasking tools, such as split-screen, let users place a document on the left to read while scribbling notes on the right.</p><p>The post says the tablet's 6GB of RAM helps keep its multitasking smooth and responsive. Moreover, users will have 64GB of storage to store everything they need. The Note Air4 C provides a 3,700mAh battery.</p><p>Users can pre-order the Boox Note Air4 C for $499 on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair4c">main website</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHGDV8F8">Amazon</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Boox rounds out its announcement with a teaser for its A4 paper-sized Note Max. The device features a 13.3-inch, " ultra-crisp" Carta 1300 e-ink display. Boox states it crafted a sleek, "chic-style" shell for this larger device. What's more, the addition of a free-form front light helps with readability and focus.</p><p>The Note Max will arrive with a 2.4GHz octa-core CPU, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Boox has not said when consumers can expect the Note Max to become available. More information will likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/notemax">come in the future</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>At the annual Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit, the company announced it would be supporting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for eight years. That's great to see, but it doesn't mean what you're probably thinking it means.</p><p>It has to do with what type of support a chip maker needs to offer and what part a phone maker plays in how long your phone is kept up to date. The two things don't align the way we think.</p>
<p>When it comes to Android version updates, three parties need to work together to provide one for the phone in your hand. Google, of course, needs to take all the new code and changes to existing code, assemble it into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">specific target for building Android</a>, and test it. It's a lot of work, and a lot of other companies contribute — Android is not written by Google alone.</p><p>Once Google has something resembling a new version, phone makers start working with it. They will take the code and see how to integrate their changes without breaking anything, then assemble all of that into something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">they can test</a>.</p><p>Finally, the companies that make microprocessors, like Qualcomm and the Snapdragon chip, might need to support a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">Linux kernel</a> or low-level operating system changes. We also see plenty of patches and bug fixes from these companies, and if you ever look into what's inside a monthly Android security patch, you'll see companies like Qualcomm doing a lot of the work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1463px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BYePTqNEqrQAXwCL7wFnE8" name="samsung galaxy s24 plus review hero image 1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 Plus on a corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYePTqNEqrQAXwCL7wFnE8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1463" height="823" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a critical part of the chain because only Qualcomm can make changes to its Snapdragon chip. Google or Samsung might know what to do and even how to do it, but Qualcomm is the only company that can legally do the work because it owns the intellectual property being worked on. Snapdragon chips are not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-open-source-android-z">open source</a>, just like MediaTek, Apple, or even Google chips aren't. Those companies own that idea and the execution of it and don't share.</p><p>If the next version of Android or the next security update requires changes to the way the chip operates and Qualcomm doesn't want to do them, phones running unsupported chips won't be updated. Sometimes Google can work around it (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nexus-7-2013-review">Nexus 7 </a>was a good example of Qualcomm not wanting to make necessary changes) but to work properly requires the chip maker's involvement.</p>
<p>None of this means that a phone maker <em>has</em> to do anything. You bought your phone with an expectation of the features it has today running as advertised. A case can be made that a company like Samsung has to deliver on that promise and fix anything that doesn't work properly, but anything new or updated is extra. That's why phone makers are quick to tell you about promises to update a phone for a certain amount of time: it's a feature that you're paying for.</p><p>Samsung doesn't have to promise seven years of support for its Galaxy S phones; it does it because it's a selling point. In a perfect world, once that promise is made, it has to be honored, but almost every phone maker has broken a promise or two along the way.</p><p>Here's where this all starts to sound more like public relations than a technical promise: every chip Qualcomm has ever made could be updated today if someone was willing to pay for it. If Google, LG, and Qualcomm wanted to, they could update the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review" target="_blank">Nexus 4</a> to the point where the chip couldn't keep up. It would still build and flash to your phone without errors; it would just run really slowly and terribly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="6dPwxnsewD85KB5HCMfsGe" name="Nexus-phone.JPG" alt="Some Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dPwxnsewD85KB5HCMfsGe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="544" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not privy to how much a company like Qualcomm charges for longer support life on one of its products, but I know that it's a negotiable part of the contract a phone maker enters when they buy millions of them. Qualcomm tells Samsung (for example) that the chip is supported for, let's say, four years. Samsung says it needs six years. Money changes hands, and six years of support is now included. This isn't free because supporting a chip costs money, and Qualcomm didn't get where it is today by giving things away. This is a big part of the reason the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidia-shield-tv-october-2024-update">NVIDIA Shield</a> has a legendary support lifetime. Nvidia is in charge of <em>everything</em>.</p><p>What I'm saying is that a phone maker could support your phone for eight years today if it wanted to. It could have supported the phone you bought five years ago for eight years. A phone maker has to juggle what's best for itself and what it can offer to us without losing money.</p><p>Eight years of support from Qualcomm is great and could lower the cost enough so that phone manufacturers start offering eight years of support on the phones, too. If it's feasible without adding too much to the phone's retail price, we just might see it. If nothing else, this level of support should mean that phones can see longer support when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-security-bulletin">security updates</a> and bug fixes, and that would be just as good!</p>

<p>Bose <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch">launched</a> the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in September 2023 and they should be easy to find in retail or online. It&apos;s unlikely Bose will release a succeeding pair to these until more time has passed, so expect these to be the company&apos;s flagship earbuds for a while yet. They start out at $299, but look for the odd discount when it happens, rare as it may be. They&apos;re available in Black or White Smoke.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-wearing.jpg" alt="Side view wearing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a design standpoint, the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-ii-review">QuietComfort Earbuds II</a> clearly influence what this pair looks like. They won&apos;t be the smallest you&apos;ll find but improved comfort and stability mean they&apos;re not likely to fall out, either. I&apos;m pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up while riding my bike, and Bose helps by finding the best fit for your ears when going through the test in the Bose Music app.</p><p>A tighter seal is crucial to getting the best noise-cancelation and sound quality, so it may take a little trial and error to figure out what&apos;s best for you. Mind you, these have the same 9.3mm drivers as the QuietComfort Earbuds II, though in going through the app&apos;s hearing test, Bose&apos;s CustomTune software adjusts the sound and noise-canceling to work best with your ear canals.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to go through the hearing test but you also can&apos;t opt out of CustomTune. It works either way doing its best to tune things, and another reason for that is to manage spatial audio, or Immersive Audio, as Bose calls it. Much of the rest of the internal components otherwise change from before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize fit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, Bose gives some attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> codecs, making the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feel more like the premium buds they&apos;re supposed to be. They support Snapdragon Sound, which includes aptX Adaptive to play hi-res tracks from sources offering them. That, plus Bluetooth 5.3, enable lower-latency playback as well, making these easier to trust when watching a show or movie.</p><p>AptX Adaptive isn&apos;t quite as good as aptX Lossless but you won&apos;t notice anyway unless you always prefer to listen to tunes at the highest bit rates. Despite that, I&apos;ll give Bose credit for a solid default sound signature. Fully expecting to have to go to the EQ in the Bose Music app and redo it all, I only made minor tweaks before I was satisfied. Not that Bose gives you too many options. A 3-band EQ isn&apos;t good enough for expensive earbuds, and the existing presets largely swing things toward bass or treble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize sound." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you&apos;re looking for bass, you&apos;ll find it here. There&apos;s enough of a rumble off the bat but cranking it up with Bass Boost in the EQ really turns it up. Truly, though, these earbuds are at their best when you level things, especially because the mids bring out more detail.</p><p>I also like the spatial effect of Immersive Audio for live recordings. Listening to concert albums or even high-quality stuff from YouTube brings out the crowd noise and atmosphere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-close-up.jpg" alt="Close-up view of Bose QuietComfort Ultra left earbud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, the signature feature is the ANC. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds cancel out noise with the kind of regularity and reliability few others can handle. Wearing them on multiple flights, commutes, and bike rides, I&apos;m impressed at how well they dampen most noise in varying conditions. It&apos;s a mark of excellent noise-canceling earbuds that you don&apos;t have to raise the volume much at all to hear your content clearly. That was the case with these just about every time.</p><p>Sure, the odd fire truck siren or construction site jackhammer seep in, but they never feel like they&apos;ll break through entirely. By muffling them to a large degree, I didn&apos;t have to adjust anything along the way.</p><p>When I did want to hear my surroundings — a must while riding a bike in a big city — I could easily switch to Aware mode by holding down the left earbud. There&apos;s plenty of detailed clarity, which is great, except my one bone of contention is how the onboard mics filter in voices. I had to take off an earbud more than once to clarify something someone said. Maybe I&apos;m losing my hearing but I haven&apos;t experienced that with a couple of other comparable earbuds or headphones, so there&apos;s room for improvement there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-in-hand.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds loose in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Touch controls are sometimes hit or miss on earbuds. Not so much on these. They&apos;re responsive and accurate just about every time. Tap once to play/pause, twice to skip a track, and three times to repeat one. Swiping up or down controls volume, which the earbuds can sometimes mistake as pausing playback, but that&apos;s the only real issue you might encounter controlling the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>Tap-and-hold cycles between ANC and Aware, though you can choose a different option, like waking your voice assistant or switching between paired Bluetooth devices. Initially, Bose didn&apos;t give the QC Ultra Earbuds multipoint connectivity — the ability to stay connected to two devices simultaneously — but adding that feature in a subsequent firmware update covered a key omission.</p><p>Bose didn&apos;t really boost battery life here, so you get the same 6-hour estimate (with ANC on) that the previous QC Earbuds II have. Since noise cancelation is so effective, you don&apos;t have to raise the volume as much, which actually does the most to preserve battery each time. The case gives you three extra charges. Just keep a USB-C cable handy when it&apos;s time to recharge the whole package because there&apos;s no wireless charging here.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: What's not good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-open-hand.jpg" alt="Open case showing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can pay an extra $49 to get a wireless charging cover and enable that feature but that feels cheap for earbuds of this caliber. Don&apos;t force people to make that choice when competitors already include it without the markup.</p><p>I&apos;m also surprised the QC Ultra Earbuds aren&apos;t better for phone calls. In spite of outstanding noise-cancelation and audio quality, call quality doesn&apos;t seem to match overall audio quality. People I spoke with weren&apos;t impressed, suggesting other earbuds I&apos;ve tested made my voice sound clearer. That&apos;s regardless of whether it was a quiet room or a bustling street. To me, it kind of feels like an extension of the Aware mode&apos;s muddier performance with voices.</p><p>IPX4 protection is also pretty barebones for earbuds, in my view, so I can&apos;t recommend these for regular workouts given what they cost. I was fine wearing them for bike rides and made sure to clean them afterward, especially since there&apos;s no dust resistance. Light runs or workouts should be fine — as well as a splash of rain — but I doubt these will last a regular, sweaty routine.</p>

<p>Bose and Sony have been jabbing each other back and forth for years over who has the best combination of comfort, sound quality, and noise-cancelation. No surprise you&apos;ll find them both at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds for Android</a>. It&apos;s usually the last one of those features that really puts them so close together, which is why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> are such a compelling alternative. It&apos;s a toss up on whether they block out more noise, but they&apos;re also a very different design and offer more personalized features than the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>While they may not match Bose or Sony for world-class noise-cancelation, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2</a> earbuds are superb and offer some conveniences those others don&apos;t have. Phone calls sound great, and LE Audio means you can use the case as a way to bridge wireless audio from sources only offering a headphone jack (think of an airplane&apos;s entertainment system).</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good sound with outstanding ANC.</li>
  <li>You want spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You want a design with stems.</li>
  <li>You travel a lot.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want wireless charging.</li>
  <li>You want a more customizable EQ.</li>
  <li>You want the best phone call quality.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Wireless earbuds are so ubiquitous today that you can choose a pair that&apos;s really good at key features you want. For the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they&apos;d have to be the combination of ANC and sound quality. Especially the noise cancelation because that&apos;s where these shine brightest against all others. You won&apos;t be disappointed in how they drown out what&apos;s happening around you.</p><p>They&apos;re a pricey proposition considering what&apos;s missing here, which is why you have to weigh what you want to prioritize most above everything else. There&apos;s room for improvement but there&apos;s no doubt Bose took a step forward with these buds.</p>

<ul><li>Google Keep already has handwriting mode for users to draw notes; an advanced version appears in the works.</li><li>The latest APK findings of the Google Keep app reveal a new handwritten notes feature, amongst other nifty improvements.</li><li>They include new backgrounds in handwriting notes mode, so you can soon see some color.</li><li>The image support in the Google Keep app should also include new tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Keep will likely add new productivity tools in the coming updates, as the latest findings of the notes app indicate new features, particularly for handwritten notes.</p><p>As noted by the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keep-notetaking-tools-3492984/">Android Authority</a> and with their APK Insights of the latest Google Keep app bearing version <strong>5.24.422.02.90</strong>, we should see a new handwritten notes feature. The notes app already offers a handwriting mode alongside plain text, checkbox list, and image-based notes. </p><p>However, the latest handwritten notes feature looks like it is aimed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with a stylus, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, for example. It even works for users who use their fingers to draw in the aforementioned modes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3" name="google-keep-new-handwritten-notes-feature.jpg" alt="New handwritten notes feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that the new handwritten notes will be separate from the drawing notes feature that the Google Keep app currently features. The one visible change to differentiate between two handwritten notes is the older handwriting note will have its title at the bottom, whereas the new one is believed to be shown at the top. </p><p>The latter also gains the ability to be shared as PDF files—a feature already available in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-note-taking-apps-android">note-taking apps</a> like Samsung Notes, for instance. The previous handwriting notes were only shared as image files, not PDFs, which appears to be a neat addition. </p><p>Furthermore, the new handwritten notes also mention a new "Text to sketch" feature, which will likely incorporate AI-based sketches in future updates of the Google Keep app. </p><p>Besides, the latest feature isn&apos;t just limited to Android phones for now; it has also been spotted on the web client file Keep — which is, however, uneditable at the moment and visible only as PDF, notes Android Authority.</p>

<p>Aside from the new handwritten notes, the app findings also indicate some nifty new features coming to the notes app. The handwriting mode previously had illustrations like lines and dots to choose from for the background for handwritten notes.

<hr>
<p>The future of Snapdragon chips is now up in the air after Arm decided to revoke Qualcomm’s license. These chips power some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a> on the market, and the ongoing clash between the two companies leaves their production in question.</p><p>Arm has given Qualcomm a 60-day notice to end their architectural license, cutting off Qualcomm's access to Arm’s chip design IP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/arm-to-cancel-qualcomm-chip-design-license-in-escalation-of-feud" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports. This marks a major escalation in their ongoing feud, which started in 2022 after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-buying-nuvia-bigger-deal-than-you-think">Qualcomm bought Nuvia</a> without renewing the licensing deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qualcomm denied Arm’s claim that it needs to end the licensing agreement. Speaking to Bloomberg, a Qualcomm representative accused Arm of trying to interfere with the legal process, calling the termination baseless. Qualcomm remains confident in its legal standing and believes its rights under the deal will be upheld.</p><p>However, if the dispute isn’t settled after the 60-day notice, Qualcomm might have to stop selling its products or face serious legal consequences, including hefty damage claims.</p><p>Arm and Qualcomm have been in a legal fight since 2022, with Qualcomm having since filed a countersuit. The dispute revolves around Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia, which led to the creation of Oryon CPUs. These custom CPUs are set to roll out in mobile chips, following their first release in Windows laptops. Unlike Arm’s Cortex cores, Oryon CPUs are Qualcomm’s own unique design.</p><p>When Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, Arm argued that Nuvia’s intellectual property, developed under an Arm license, couldn’t be transferred to Qualcomm without permission or a new agreement. Arm even demanded that the designs be scrapped altogether.</p><p>Qualcomm, on the other hand, argues that its current licensing agreement already covers Nuvia’s operations, the chip-design startup it bought.</p><p>The dispute could impact SoCs with Oryon CPUs, like the Snapdragon X Elite (already in various PCs) and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. However, earlier models, such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, are expected to be unaffected.</p><p>Up to now, Qualcomm and Arm have been negotiating the use of Arm's processor architecture for designs like the Snapdragon X Elite, which powers Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs and other Windows laptops running on Arm.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/report-arm-is-sensationally-canceling-qualcomms-chip-license-oct-2024" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> points out that traditional x86 processors are losing traction due to energy concerns, pushing Microsoft to develop Windows for Arm devices. The Surface Pro 11 highlights this effort, but the current dispute could threaten the entire program.</p><p>While Copilot+ PCs are still emerging, the licensing conflict might significantly affect the global smartphone market, as Qualcomm chips are commonly found in Android phones.</p>

After nearly a decade of semi-custom designs, Qualcomm is once again leveraging a fully custom architecture, and that is immensely exciting. </p><p>As you can imagine, Qualcomm is touting heady gains across the board with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and with a node shift to 3nm, the chipset may just be one of the best we&apos;ve gotten in recent years. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and how it compares to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Qualcomm is changing how it uses cores in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the platform featuring eight performance cores as standard. You don&apos;t get the usual efficiency cores that do a bulk of the mundane tasks, with Qualcomm emulating MediaTek in this regard. If you want to know more about why Qualcomm ditched efficiency cores with this generation, my colleague Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">talked to Qualcomm engineers</a> about why it&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a look at how the Snapdragon 8 Elite compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400:</p>

<p>Qualcomm significantly boosted the clocks of its cores, with the main cores now going up to 4.32GHz — nearly 1GHz more than that of the 8 Gen 3. This is because of the node shift to 3nm; Qualcomm is finally using TSMC&apos;s 3nm node, and that allows the manufacturer to deliver increased frequencies while still maintaining stable thermals. </p><p>Qualcomm is also touting heady gains on the gaming side of things, along with a new neural engine, and AI-assisted tweaks to its imaging platform. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-heading-back-to-custom-designs-with-oryon-cpu"><span>Heading back to custom designs with Oryon CPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm has been switching up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite comes with the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. Because of the use of second-gen Oryon cores, Qualcomm is able to deliver incredible gains, with the brand touting a massive 45% gain in performance over the 8 Gen 3 in single-core and multi-core workloads.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the 8 Elite is 44% more efficient while performing the same workloads as the 8 Gen 3, and that&apos;s more than a generational increase. Qualcomm used semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, while retaining Kryo branding.</p><p>However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility. The return to custom cores gives the Snapdragon 8 Elite a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon.</p><p>In fact, this is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p><p>What does the switch to the custom architecture entail? Well, Qualcomm is touting incredible gains in performance over the 8 Gen 3, and that should make a difference in real-world use. Qualcomm is just using two core clusters this time, and that allows the brand to tailor tasks with better efficiency — we got four clusters last year.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the 4.32GHz frequency on the main cores; this is considerably more than previous years, and while the cores only go up to the maximum frequency in very short bursts, it should still make a difference.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-taking-gaming-to-new-heights-with-adreno-gpu"><span>Taking gaming to new heights with Adreno GPU</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2542px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:128.17%;"><img id="MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Inside-View" alt="A photo of a phone's internal parts, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo sitting in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MKMTxRHWBnBpTNK43vhYYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2542" height="3258" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the gaming side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Elite switches up the naming convention once again, with Qualcomm just going with Adreno branding without any model numbers. Again, we get heady figures, with Qualcomm touting a 40% increase in performance. What is much more interesting is that the GPU is 40% more efficient at the same tasks as the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>The GPU also includes increased video memory, and there&apos;s a 35% uptick in ray tracing along with the ability to use Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite engine. All of these features are undoubtedly great, but what I&apos;m interested in knowing is how phones with the platform handle sustained gaming; this has been an issue on the 8 Gen 3, and while there was no shortage of power, it led to overheating and thermal constraints.</p><p>It remains to be seen if those issues have been mitigated with this generation, and if we actually get usable titles that have ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>You can&apos;t go two minutes in the tech industry without a mention of AI, and Qualcomm is rolling out several upgrades in this area as well. The Hexagon NPU has a 45% increase in AI performance, along with 45% better efficiency per watt. It integrates multimodal AI engines, including Gemini Nano.</p><p>While I don&apos;t see the point of mobile AI just yet, what is interesting is how Qualcomm is leveraging machine learning into its imaging platform. The Spectra AI ISP now includes limitless real-time semantic segmentation, and that should deliver better portrait shots. You get to see these benefits in videos as well, and that&apos;s just great.</p>

OnePlus isn&apos;t far behind with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which is launching in China on October 31. </p><p>Honor is debuting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-magic-7-series-is-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-and-it-comes-with-an-on-device-autopilot-ai">Magic 7 series</a> with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and we have ASUS, Nubia, iQOO, and other manufacturers getting in on the action. We usually need to wait until the end of the year to get devices based on Qualcomm&apos;s latest silicon, but it looks like some device makers are targeting an early release, so we don&apos;t need to wait to get hands on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. </p>

<ul><li>The floating bottom bar in Google Chat now has a pill shape instead of a circular design, along with a bit of extra width.</li><li>The color scheme has been upgraded with Dynamic Color, enhancing contrast and overall look in Google Chat.</li><li>Plus, the last icon switched from the @ symbol to three dots.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing a floating bottom navigation bar to Google Chat around a year ago, Google is now sprucing it up to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> vibe.</p><p>The floating bottom bar, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">debuted about a year ago as part of a bigger Google redesign</a>, just got a fresh new look. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/google-chat-floating-bottom-bar-material-you/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this refresh makes everything feel more cohesive and visually appealing in the app.</p><p>Prior to this update, the floating bottom bar had a circular shape that helped you spot the active feed. It featured four icons and a button to start a new message. Now, it’s been reshaped into a pill-like design and widened a bit.</p><p>While this change might take up a little more screen space, this refresh gives it a style that jives better with how other Google apps work.</p><p>The fresh design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">debuted along with Gemini summaries</a>, which are now popping up in Google Chat's Home view. Just long-press a thread on your phone, and Gemini summaries will help you get up to speed on any missed conversations. The AI assistant will provide three bullet points summarizing the key points.</p><p>For those using Google Chat on desktop, a 'Summarize' button shows up when you hover over a conversation thread. Clicking it works like the long-press on mobile, giving you a quick summary of the chat.</p><p>Another upgrade is the new color scheme. The background of the floating bottom bar now uses Dynamic Color, letting it blend in nicely with your device's color palette.</p><p>This change boosts its contrast with the rest of the Chat interface, making everything look nicer together. Also, the last icon has swapped out the @ symbol for three dots. All these tweaks come together to create a more stylish and unified user interface in the app.</p><p>Right now, though, the floating bottom bar design is unique to Google Chat, but at least the recent updates have made it look good enough to hang out with the other Google apps.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out a bunch of new security features for its Messages app that use on-device AI to fend off spam, shady links, and other digital junk.</p><p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">top messaging app</a> picked up some upgraded scam detection, zeroing in on catching fake delivery and job offer scams.</p><p>If it detects a potential scam, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> will either toss it into the spam folder or alert you with a warning. It uses on-device machine learning to catch these tricks while keeping your chats private, according to the search giant's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This update is currently being tested by beta users who have activated the spam protection feature.</p><p>Next up, Google is rolling out smart alerts for potentially risky links. These malicious URLs can cause serious trouble, from installing harmful software to sending users to fake phishing sites.</p><p>The messaging app will alert users when they get links from unknown sources and filter out messages with such links. Currently, Google is testing this feature with users in India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, with plans to roll it out globally later this year.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that while many scam texts come from abroad, they’re not all international. Google has revealed that users will soon be able to automatically hide messages from international senders not in their contacts. Those messages will go straight to the "Spam & blocked" folder. This feature is currently being tested in Singapore and will roll out to more countries soon.</p><p>The latest safety upgrades also bring smart alerts that automatically blur nudity in images. If users try to share explicit content, they'll get a warning about the potential risks. This feature will be enabled by default for users under 18, while adults will have to opt in via the Android settings.  This update is expected to roll out in the coming months for Android devices running version 9 or later.</p><p>Scammers don’t only rely on international numbers; they often impersonate real businesses or even friends. To combat these tricks, the Messages app is launching a contact verification system that uses each contact's public key to confirm their identity, checking sender credentials via a QR code or registered phone number.</p><p>Let’s hope Google speeds up the rollout of these new features. After all, over a billion people are counting on Google Messages to keep their daily chats flowing, as per the company.</p>
