                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A feature that tracks and finds lost devices isn&apos;t a new idea. Both Google and Apple have been doing it for years, but as technology advances, things get updated, and Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">started rolling out the new Find My Device</a> network in North America.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-can-now-quickly-google-find-my-phone-find-lost-android-device">idea isn&apos;t new</a>, but how it&apos;s done and what it can do sure is. With a network of well over a billion devices, you can now find your lost phone — and plenty of other things — more easily and in a way that makes it secure by design.</p>
<p>Part of what makes it better is what it can do. Five cool new features make the new feature better than the older version:</p><p><strong>1. The ability to locate offline devices.</strong> You can locate your Android phone or tablet on a map and send a notification to make them ring even when they aren&apos;t connected to a network. If you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro</a>, this even works when the phone is turned off or the battery is dead. We&apos;ll talk more about that a bit later.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use new Bluetooth trackers to keep track of other things.</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Third-party companies</a> are soon releasing small tags for use with Google&apos;s network. You can attach these tags to anything and keep tabs on it through the Find My Device network. They&apos;re also built to be compatible with Google and Apple&apos;s unknown tracker alert system to make sure nobody can use them without you knowing it.</p><p><strong>3. Locate nearby devices. </strong>If you&apos;re close to something you&apos;re looking for, a button will appear that lets you figure out exactly where it is. As you get warmer, the shape fills and as you get colder it shrinks. Nifty.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ" name="find-my-device-1.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGE2HpfXohwqj6iiDRjyUZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1179" height="663" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>4. Use Google Nest devices to help find things at home.</strong> With things like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Nest Home</a> as part of the new network, it&apos;s easier to find lost things in your house. Your Nest devices only work to find your stuff in your house, thanks to the built-in home protection of the new network.</p><p><strong>5. Share accessories with your family or friends.</strong> You&apos;ll be able to share a compatible Bluetooth accessory or tracker with others so they can keep tabs on where it&apos;s at, too.</p>
<p>So it seems like the new feature is really cool and very comparable to what Apple has been doing with it&apos;s own network. Under the surface it&apos;s a lot different, though. Let&apos;s dig in.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:837px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.68%;"><img id="zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY" name="google-find-my-device-locator-io-2023.jpg" alt="Using proximity to locate a lost item through the Find My Device network." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzVhapjd9TH4kfEm2MeqCY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="837" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The short answer is Bluetooth. Almost everything has a Bluetooth connection nowadays, and leveraging it in a way that reports where it&apos;s at concerning other Bluetooth devices makes sense. Never lose your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">favorite earbuds</a> again.</p><p>Imagine you&apos;ve attached a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-joins-google-find-my-device-tracker-debut">Chipolo tracking tag</a> to your keyring. It has a Bluetooth radio inside that "broadcasts" its location so that other devices that are compatible with and have enrolled in the new Find My Device network can "listen" to it.</p>
<p>All these devices report data back to Google in aggregate, and if you want to find your keyring with its attached Chipolo tracker, you&apos;ll get a location based on how far it is from other devices.</p><p>Knowing how far it is from one device does nothing, but when you have billions of devices, you can get a very close estimate of the actual location. When you get close, the strength of the Bluetooth signal is used to fill a shape on your screen until you&apos;re right on top of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf" name="Google-Find-My.jpg" alt="A render of Find My device against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPu2oHj32ksQWjJVw6coqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing left to do is make it all secure and private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Google tries to do this</a> in a few different ways, such as through aggregation and encryption.</p><p>You&apos;ll need to opt-in to the feature, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14796936?hl=en&ref_topic=7651004&sjid=3104889368197014343-NC">you&apos;ll have three options</a> — opt out completely, contribute to aggregation, or use the network without contributing to aggregation. To explain exactly what Google means by aggregation, here are its own words:</p><p>"With aggregation, the Find My Device network waits until multiple Android devices have detected a lost item. Find My Device then shows the owner of the lost item a center point calculated from the multiple location reports."</p>
<p>What this does is tell a user where a thing is without telling them where any of the devices that help find it are located. If your phone tells Google where a luggage tag is located, the person who owns the luggage tag has no way of knowing where you are or that you contributed at all.</p><p>In addition, when Google sends location data to you, it&apos;s end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the tracker owner and anyone it&apos;s shared with. This means nobody but you (or another person you authorized) can use it — this data can&apos;t be shared even if you want it to be shared.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.00%;"><img id="HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem" name="find-my-device-3.png" alt="Find My Device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtSmnGGTuG6cdU4ey7Vaem.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two other important features are worth noting. The service has what Google calls "At Home Protection," and the way it works is that as long as you&apos;re in the places you&apos;ve designated as Home, your Android devices don&apos;t contribute location reports back to the Find My Device network. Nobody can use this data to find out where you live.</p><p>The last thing worth noting is that all of this is compliant with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">unknown tracker alerts industry standard</a>. If someone tries to use a tag to track you, you&apos;ll get notified once your phone notices it is close to you and stays close to you. If someone sticks a tracker on your car or in your purse, it&apos;s going to tell you.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-not-to-love-2">What&apos;s not to love?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL" name="Google-Pixel-8-mint-colorway-holding-back-01.jpg" alt="The mint colorway of the Google Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHAkdeQq3P5TrA2YK9FedL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m sure that privacy advocates will look closely at what Google has done, find things that aren&apos;t ideal, and maybe Google will address them. In the meantime, I see two issues that need to be discussed.</p><p>The first is tracking your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>&apos;s location when the phone is turned off, or the battery is dead. All Google says is, "Thanks to specialized Pixel hardware, Pixel 8 and 8 Pro owners will also be able to find their devices if they&apos;re powered off or the battery is dead." That&apos;s not helpful at all, and with Google&apos;s track record when it comes to privacy, we need to know more.</p><p>I expect Google will tell us more at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O</a>, and in the meantime, I&apos;ve reached out to the company in search of more concrete answers regarding this "specialized hardware" and how it works. If I get any, I&apos;ll share them.</p>
<p>The second thing isn&apos;t an issue with the service at all. If it works as well as it sounds, it&apos;s a crying shame Apple isn&apos;t on board.</p><p>Yes, Apple has a service that uses a high-frequency radio to do the same thing, and if you&apos;re in a country like the U.S., where half the people have an iPhone, it works well. However, the downside is that it won&apos;t work if you&apos;re not in an area with a high saturation of iPhone users (and such places exist in the world).</p><p>If Apple wanted to, it could piggyback on Google&apos;s service and make it better for everyone. Sometimes, companies should stop squabbling and do what&apos;s best for their customers. This is one of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hate the idea of anything tracking me, and I don&apos;t trust Google when it comes to collecting data because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-incognito-mode-update">the sketchy things</a> it has been caught doing. However, this service seems like it&apos;s worth it, and with the safeguards Google has in place, it seems secure and safe. I&apos;ll be using it once trackers become available after Google I/O.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Private Space will supposedly allow users to store private apps separately and suggest using a dedicated Google account for enhanced security.</li><li>The feature will enable the installation of apps privately, either through a dedicated button or by long-pressing apps outside Private Space.</li><li>Private Space will appear in the app drawer with a lock icon and can be customized, such as hiding the icon for discretion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The upcoming Private Space feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> has made several appearances in various builds of Android 14&apos;s Quarterly Platform Release (QPR) updates. With the recent release of more code in the latest Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 build, we&apos;ve got the full scoop on how this feature works and what it looks like.</p><p>Back in December 2023, Mishaal Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-private-space-first-look/" target="_blank">spilled the beans</a> on a new feature dubbed Private Space, believed to be making its debut with Android 15. At that time, nobody knew much about it, and it seemed like it was just a way to hide apps and files securely, keeping them away from prying eyes.</p><p>A few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-spaces-revamp-features-added">more privacy options popped up</a>, including the ability to automatically lock Private Space and hide sensitive information from your lock screen. It&apos;s like the Secure Folder on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>, where you choose what to secure and how. And now, a new report shows this privacy feature in action.</p><p>According to a video Rahman shared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-private-space-hands-on-3432113/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Private Space is described as a feature where you can stash private apps in a separate corner of your phone. It also suggests using a dedicated Google account for added security.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlh8qgsVMGI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<h2 id="here-apos-s-the-lowdown-on-private-space-2">Here&apos;s the lowdown on Private Space</h2>
<p>To get Private Space up and running, go to Settings, pick "Security & privacy," and finally tap Private Space. Once there, you&apos;d need to verify your identity. After that, you&apos;d sign in to a Google account to make it simpler to add apps to Private Space.</p><p>Private Space&apos;s setup process differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung&apos;s Locked Folder</a>. It&apos;s a bit more complex since it suggests setting up a separate Google account specifically for Private Space. The goal seems to be to ensure that your data and browsing history stay isolated within Private Space rather than mixing with your regular account. Nevertheless, users still have the freedom to choose whichever Google account they prefer to use.</p><p>Another significant update to Private Space is its feature that allows the installation of apps privately, keeping them hidden from outside view. These apps are downloaded using the Google account linked to the created space. According to Rahman, users can download apps within Private Space using a dedicated "install apps" button or by long-pressing an app outside the space, which prompts an option to "install in private."</p><p>Once you&apos;ve turned on Private Space, you&apos;ll spot it at the bottom of your app drawer with a lock icon and the label "Private." Just tap the icon to unlock it. You can adjust Private Space settings anytime, like hiding the icon from the app drawer to keep it discreet. If you try to change any Private Space settings, you&apos;ll need to unlock the feature first.</p><p>Some apps are automatically in your secure space, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a>, Contacts, Drive, Files, Photos, and the Play Store. If you want to add more, tap "Install Apps" and choose the ones you want. Or, long-press an app and pick "Install in Private."</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t officially released the feature yet, but it&apos;s speculated that upcoming Android 15 beta updates might come with it.</p>

<p>Android 15 is on its way to an Android phone near you, and while Google continues releasing early builds to developers, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-could-support-bluetooth-audio-sharing">Android 15 preview revealed</a> a promising feature for music lovers like myself. It looks like Bluetooth audio sharing across devices might be available natively once the new platform update rolls out, and I couldn&apos;t be more excited.</p><p>Listening to music on a Bluetooth speaker is enjoyable, but it&apos;s not always ideal. Sometimes, you and your friend or partner might want to listen to the same audio and still want some privacy. In the days before the advent of TWS Bluetooth earbuds, such scenarios would usually involve sharing a pair of wired earphones or using an AUX splitter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/editors-desk-headphone-jack-isnt-coming-back">3.5mm audio port is severely endangered</a> at this point. This means watching the same movie or YouTube video on a phone or tablet with someone requires you to use the device&apos;s speakers or give one wireless earbud to each individual. And if you&apos;re wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">over-ear headphones</a>, it&apos;s simply not possible.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about you, but I find this to be annoying time and time again. Every once in a while, my husband and I bicker over who gets which earbud when watching something or listening to music. This usually happens when we&apos;re traveling.</p>

<p>Samsung rolled out a nifty solution for this many years ago. The feature is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-dual-audio-on-a-samsung-phone">Dual Audio</a>, and most of the brands&apos; phones have it. You can connect two audio devices to a phone via Bluetooth and stream the same audio to both simultaneously. This can be headphones, earbuds, or speakers, as long as your Samsung phone and the audio gadget have Bluetooth 5.0 or higher. There&apos;s a two-device limitation, but it&apos;s still a great way to watch something or listen to something with someone.</p><p>Non-Samsung Android phones do not come with this feature. This got me thinking, and I found it strange that they don&apos;t because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/how-to-use-multipoint-audio-switching-pixel-buds-pro">Multipoint connection</a> has been around for several years now. Since you are already able to connect several devices to a single phone via Bluetooth at the same time, why not add the ability to push audio playback at once, too?</p><p>I was curious, so I did a little digging. Turns out things are a little more complicated than that. Multipoint revolves around the ability to receive audio from multiple sources. Being able to connect and output to several devices simultaneously requires different technical specs, which may explain why only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> have Dual audio. The exact working details of this are still fuzzy, and I&apos;ve reached out to Samsung for more details on how the company is able to get Dual Audio working on its devices, but I did not receive a response in time for publication. However, I will update the article once I get more information. However, it&apos;s clear that compatibility plays a role here.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Dual Audio is an algorithmic optimization that makes it possible for Bluetooth 5.0 and higher devices to stream audio output to two devices simultaneously. While it has been around from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-dual-audio">era of the Galaxy S8</a>, Samsung improved the feature and highlighted it more from the Galaxy S21 series onwards.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1481px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rpDnfioPHFwNryr3z2ZdTG" name="samsung-dual-audio.jpg" alt="How to use Samsung Dual audio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpDnfioPHFwNryr3z2ZdTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1481" height="833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung isn&apos;t the only one with this feature though. Apple phones have a similar audio-sharing feature, and just like Samsung, devices must support Bluetooth 5.0 or above. iPhones can share audio to multiple audio devices via Bluetooth.</p><p>Now, as spotted in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15 developer preview</a>, it looks like more Android users will be able to share their phone&apos;s audio playback to multiple devices. Although the feature was not functioning in the preview at the time of writing, it did display an option to share the audio with "everyone," further leading us to believe that there might not be a mere two-device limit, which is very exciting.</p>
<p>Based on everything shown, I assume the feature is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Bluetooth Auracast</a> technology. Auracast was previously known as Audio Sharing, but it underwent a facelift very recently.</p><p>Bluetooth SIG launched the new and improved version of the feature in June 2022, but we had yet to see any devices launch with it until recently, again, thanks to Samsung and One UI 6.1, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">recently rolled out</a> to select Galaxy flagships. Auracast was also shown off at CES 2024, following which several Samsung devices, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a>, were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-2-pro-auto-switch-auracast-update">updated</a> to support it.</p><p>The best part about Bluetooth Auracast is that it has no device limitation; you can broadcast audio output to as many devices as you like with it. And since it requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth LE Audio</a> and Bluetooth 5.2 to work, it&apos;s safe to assume that it won&apos;t consume as much power as Bluetooth Classic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C" name="Bluetooth-Auracast-hero.jpg" alt="Bluetooth Auracast audio sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mweFGVKnsdobmxdQd3nT9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we draw closer to the estimated July release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, my hopes are getting higher and higher. Google often picks up Samsung&apos;s most in-demand features and merges them into Android. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-19-1pm-et-quick-share-becomes-a-true-airdrop-alternative-with-support-for-all-android-and-chrome-os-devices">Quick Share</a> is one such example, and audio sharing over Bluetooth could be the next one to follow suit.</p><p>I&apos;m banking on Google to popularize this feature and bring it to all Android users. If the audio-sharin feature is indeed powered by Bluetooth Auracast, it&apos;s going to be even more useful and versatile.</p><p>All the signs are there; I just hope it plays out as seamlessly as it did in my head. This could change the way we use our wireless audio gadgets in such a big way, so it would be a darn shame if incompatibility or other issues held it back.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio sells products in about a dozen categories, but it&apos;s the brand&apos;s budget DACs and IEMs that contribute to its bottom line in a meaningful way. There has been a lot of excitement in this area in recent months, with Fiio launching a lot of new models in its dongle DAC range, and the brand is now focusing on its Bluetooth offerings.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka13-review">KA13</a> do a great job delivering a clean sound in a tiny chassis, they need to be plugged in — you don&apos;t get Bluetooth connectivity. Thankfully, the brand has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr5-2021-review">BTR5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-btr7-review">BTR7</a> if you want Bluetooth DACs, and both are highly regarded; I use the BTR7 extensively. And now, there&apos;s a new entrant in this segment: the BTR15.</p><p>Although the naming convention suggests the BTR15 should be the flagship offering, it is an updated model of the BTR5 that has a ton of enticing features. It shares the same design as the BTR5, but you get a larger OLED panel, updated Bluetooth modem with Bluetooth 5.1, and the ability to deliver up to 340mW of power, which is more than the BTR7.</p><p>The best part? The BTR15 retails for just $109, which is lower than the launch price of the BTR5.</p>

<p>Fiio launched the BTR15 back in October 2023, and the DAC is now available globally. Over in the U.S., the DAC is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-BTR15-Headphone-Resolution-Smartphones/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">for $109 on Amazon</a>, and you can pick it up from a variety of audio retailers. The DAC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/FIIO-BTR15-Bluetooth-Headphone-Amplifier-Black/dp/B0CM3NVGYL">costs £114 in the U.K.</a>, and in India, it is available for ₹9,999 ($120).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB" name="fiio-btr15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4UuhDCDYECa6opM9CTUXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio really doesn&apos;t like changing the design of its products between generations, and as a result, the BTR15 shares a lot of design similarities to the BTR5. Both have the same aesthetic with dual curved sides — similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> — and there&apos;s glass coating the front and back panels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD" name="fiio-btr15-14.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ezL5uoVNeKvtuPbQUKGDVD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the chassis is constructed out of aluminum, and the build quality is exquisite. The design itself is rather elegant, and it gives the BTR15 a sense of refinement that belies its price tag. I used the DAC for the better part of three months, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC" name="fiio-btr15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjzXBKuMc3btjmgmtciVTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 37.3g, the BTR15 is small enough that you can just carry it in your pocket, and the diminutive size makes it a great choice. It is a smidgen narrower and thicker than the BTR5, but other than that, the design is fundamentally unchanged.</p>

<p>You get all the buttons on the right, and there is a lot to cover. There&apos;s the power button, multifunction button, volume rocker, and a toggle that lets you switch between Bluetooth, PC, and phone modes. The buttons are tiny, but they have good tactile feedback.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-connectivity-you-need-2">All the connectivity you need</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC" name="fiio-btr15-9.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noMXrXxMx45EEjmg3bK2bC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key difference over the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has a 4.4mm port alongside the standard 3.5mm port. The BTR5 had a 2.5mm port for the balanced connection, but with the inclusion of a 4.4mm port, you can use the BTR15 with a significantly wider range of products, including headsets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C" name="fiio-btr15-6.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVkucrvVWPuBMX5NKTJh2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can connect the BTR15 with your phone via Bluetooth or USB-C, and the DAC uses Qualcomm&apos;s QCC5125 modem, offering Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. This is the same modem that&apos;s used in costlier DACs like the Q15 and K9, so it&apos;s great to see Fiio bringing it to a budget product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC" name="fiio-btr15-10.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SsjT2YDNh55RjXZbG4whnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to greater range, the QCC5125 unlocks high-res audio codecs; you get LDAC along with the full suite of AptX codecs, including AptX, AptX LL, AptX Adaptive, and AptX HD. The BTR15 has a 550mAh battery, and it lasts just over six hours in LDAC mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD" name="fiio-btr15-12.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vi2m4kGLzfgdaKDRahovAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another major difference is the screen; the BTR15 has a larger 0.96-inch OLED panel, and it has higher contrast text, making it easy to read outdoors. You can use the screen to navigate the settings, including adjusting the gain, tweaking the EQ, switching to the built-in car mode, and a whole lot more. You can also use the Fiio Control app to change all the setting.</p>
<p>The default screen shows the mode currently in use, volume level, gain, and battery indicator. The screen gives the BTR15 a distinct edge over the KA series of dongle DACs.</p>

<p>The BTR15 features dual ESS ES9219MQ DACs, and the USB side of things is handled by an XMOS XU316. It goes up to 384kHz/32-bit over PCM and has DSD256, but it&apos;s the power on offer that makes it stand out against the BTR5 and even the BTR7.</p><p>The BTR15 manages to deliver 165mW of power at 16Ω and 125mW at 32Ω over the 3.5mm port, and it goes up to 270mW at 16Ω and 340mW at 32Ω when using the balanced 4.4mm port. It is more powerful than the BTR7 in this regard, and it is able to drive just about any IEM in the market, as well as planar headsets like the FT5.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC" name="fiio-btr15-7.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VTcrKz77pmSVkFTdYU9DHC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the BTR15 has the same clean sound that&apos;s a characteristic of the brand&apos;s budget DACs, and you get a slight hint of warmth that makes using it enjoyable. I tested the DAC with the Fiio FX15 and FT5, and both proved to be good pairings; the BTR15 was able to deliver a vibrant bass with good texture, unlocking the potential of the FX15. The mid-range is natural and has plenty of clarity, with vocals coming through with good articulation.</p><p>The treble is detailed and airy, and the biggest difference between the BTR5 is that the BTR15 has better resolution overall.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-what-i-didn-t-like"><span>Fiio BTR15: What I didn't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E" name="fiio-btr15-15.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4YpePvYiGsQDj6ZaotF2E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There really isn&apos;t much to criticize with the BTR15. The only quibble I have with the design is that the glass panels tend to smudge easily, and the back is prone to scratches if you carry it around in your pocket. This can be mitigated by using the bundled clear case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD" name="fiio-btr15-16.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6hEUSGjdnw7PLvpsYtQgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The BTR5 had a nifty option to use NFC to connect to phones easily, and that&apos;s missing on the BTR15. It isn&apos;t a huge omission by itself, but it was a cool feature. Also, you don&apos;t get a USB-C to Lightning cable in the box any longer; with the iPhone 15 models switching over to USB-C, Fiio has decided to bundle just a USB-C cable and a USB-A dongle in the package, so if you&apos;re using an older iPhone, you will need to source a small USB-C to Lightning cable.</p>
<p>There&apos;s no fast charging, so even though the BTR15 has a small 550mAh battery, it takes nearly two hours to charge the DAC. My Magic 6 Pro has a battery that&apos;s nearly ten times larger, and it takes just under an hour to charge. Obviously, the BTR15 is designed to be used for much longer than a phone, and it makes sense that Fiio wants to prolong battery life, but fast charging of up to 10W would have made a difference — right now, it only goes up to 5W. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-btr15-should-you-buy-it"><span>Fiio BTR15: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB" name="fiio-btr15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio BTR15 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVnEYMn6vanXod8BW4tDhB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a Bluetooth DAC with plenty of power</li><li>You need a balanced 4.4mm port</li><li>You want good battery life</li><li>You need a DAC that's easily pocketable</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want fast charging</li></ul>
<p>Having switched to the BTR15 from the BTR5 and BTR7, it&apos;s easy to tell that Fiio is onto a winner. The DAC delivers a clean sound and retains a lot of the same tonal characteristics as the BTR7, and the increased power on offer makes it a better choice if you&apos;re interested in a Bluetooth DAC to use with a headset.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the value to consider. At $109, the BTR15 is the best value in the brand&apos;s DAC portfolio as of writing. It manages to outmatch the BTR5 considerably, and has notable wins against the costlier BTR7, and that&apos;s no small feat.</p>

Realme has managed to carve a niche for itself here by continually delivering new offerings with improved specs and great designs. The latter aspect has always been the brand&apos;s signature recipe for any new smartphone, and that’s still going strong in 2024. </p><p>The Realme 12 series is the latest number offering from the Chinese brand and already, we have about five different models ranging from $150 to about $400. The one on test today is the Realme 12 Plus 5G, which sits somewhere in the middle of the pack and yet, manages to cram some pretty impressive features. </p><p>Realme claims it’s the first in the segment to get a 50MP Sony LYT-600 main camera sensor, along with IP54 water resistance with “Rainwater Smart Touch” treatment for the display, and a 120Hz AMOLED display with incredibly high peak brightness. These features, coupled with a sophisticated design and aggressive pricing makes it a very tempting proposition. It’s time to find out if you should indeed consider it over the competition. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-realme-12-plus-5g-price-and-availability"><span>Realme 12 Plus 5G: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-9.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R8CvJWS6S3ZjFJzgDHNJiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is available in many Southeast Asian countries like India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. I received the Indian retail unit of the top-end variant, priced at Rs. 21,999 ($265), which comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The base variant isn’t much cheaper at Rs. 20,999 ($253) and has the same amount of RAM but 128GB of storage. Needless to say, you should get the 256GB variant directly if you&apos;re considering this phone, as it’s the best value for money. </p><p>The 12 Plus 5G comes in two colors, Pioneer green and Navigator beige. The latter is more of a neutral shade and will go well with any attire, but the green variant certainly has its own charm and looks equally striking. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-realme-12-plus-5g-what-i-like"><span>Realme 12 Plus 5G: What I like </span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-7.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKTCnkoWp8GYj5CpfbfoYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The entire 12 series is built around the same design language in partnership with luxury watch designer Ollivier Savéo. The single, circular rear camera dial, vegan leather back panel, and the diamond-patterned stripe running vertically through the center of the phone are all said to be inspired by luxury watches. The Pro models in the series get more intricate patterns, but for what it costs, I think the Realme 12 Plus looks stylish and unique. The faux leather back also means there’s no worry of cracks if you drop it or ugly fingerprint smudges. </p><p>The phone doesn’t feel too heavy at 190g despite packing a large display and battery. Realme has included a headphone jack for those who still prefer wired audio, and the second slot of the dual-SIM tray can accommodate a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> if you need more storage. The Redmi 12 Plus is also IP54-rated for dust and water resistance, which is a big deal in this segment. It’s not waterproof, but it should easily survive a heavy drizzle or light splashes of water. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-5.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnAJ9pa2caaVNkLUzzppEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display on the Realme 12 Plus is also very good for its segment. It’s a flat 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with a FHD+ (2,400x1,080) resolution and a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate. The protective glass has 3D-curved edges all around so it’s gentle on your fingers when performing gestures. Color reproduction is vibrant and the screen has a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits (600 nits typical). </p><p>Thanks to this, content was always easily visible, even under the harsh Mumbai summer heat. The vibrancy of colors can be adjusted in the Settings app, but I found the default Vivid profile to be quite accurate. I also didn’t notice any major color shift when viewing the display off-axis, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>The 12 Plus 5G’s display also gets something called a Rainwater Smart Touch feature. This is supposed to maintain accurate touch response even when water falls on the display and also keeps the in-display fingerprint reader functional with moist fingers. </p><p>This kind of works to an extent, but not always. For instance, the display still registers phantom touches when placed under running water, but once removed, it’s actually usable even with big droplets still on the screen. Using the fingerprint sensor in such conditions was hit or miss, as it worked sometimes but struggled to register otherwise.  </p>

<p>The performance of the Realme 12 Plus 5G has been a smooth affair in the two weeks I’ve been using it. It’s backed by a decently powerful MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, which is a bit more potent than a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 but on par or little behind something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> in benchmarks. </p><p>If you’re a casual mobile gamer like myself, then you’ll enjoy playing games like Asphalt 9: Legends or Call of Duty Mobile (with low to medium graphics) on the 12 Plus. The visuals are great, the framerate is generally solid, and the sound from the stereo speakers will keep you engaged for hours. Some portion of the frame and the rear camera bump get a bit warm after, say, 30 minutes of playing, but never overly hot. The screen has a standard 240Hz touch sampling rate, which I found to be adequate. </p>

<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G worked well on the 5G networks here in India. The phone supports a total of nine 5G bands, some of which are also supported by all the major U.S. carriers, which means you can easily use the phone on your travels to the U.S. NFC is not present, but you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<p>Battery life is quite impressive, too, with the 5,000mAh capacity easily lasting for up to two full days on one charge. Even with a bit of gaming and heavy camera testing, I was still able to go past one full day of use. The 12 Plus 5G can also be charged quickly, thanks to 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging. In practice, you can get a 50 percent charge in just under 20 minutes. The best thing about Realme phones is that the charger comes bundled in the box. </p>

<p>The primary camera on the Realme 12 Plus 5G is pretty good for the segment. The 50MP Sony LYT-600 sensor is optically stabilized (OIS) and has an aperture of f/1.9. Photos are saved at roughly 12.5MP resolution by default, but you can take a full 50MP photo if you need to. Landscapes and close-up photos generally have good sharpness, vivid colors, and decent details in daylight. The ultrawide also manages some decent shots here under bright sunlight. Low-light shots from the main camera are fairly detailed, autofocus is quick, and you can get away with shooting single-handed in Night mode (with a one-second delay) thanks to OIS.</p>

<p>The large sensor also lets you do a 2x lossless zoom (in-sensor crop). Some interesting shooting modes include Street, which lets you toggle an auto-zoom feature. Once you tap your subject, the app tries to aesthetically frame the shot by zooming in on it. You also get the usual selection of shooting modes like slow-mo, timelapse, etc. The 12 Plus 5G can also shoot videos up to 4K 30fps, but without any stabilization.</p>

<p>Apart from the main camera on the 12 Plus 5G, the rest are pretty run-of-the-mill sensors that fail to impress. The rear camera dials make it look like there are four cameras, but one of them is just a dummy to complete the symmetry. The 8-megapixel ultrawide camera fares well in daylight, with minimal barrel distortion, but colors and details are weak compared to the main camera. In low light, Night mode helps maintain a decent exposure, but peek a bit closer, and you&apos;ll notice colors and details are simply lacking. </p><p>There’s a 2MP macro camera in the dial, too, but it’s not great and best left unused. Sadly, the 16MP selfie camera isn’t much to shout about either. You can expect passable selfies under good lighting but average ones in low light. There’s a screen flash to assist in low-light shots, but it can only do so much. </p><p>The quality of recorded video is fairly average too from the ultrawide camera. You can only record up to 1080p 30fps with it, but if you begin recording with the main camera at this resolution, there’s no way to switch to the ultrawide mid-shooting. </p>

<p>My main gripe with the 12 Plus 5G is the bloated nature of Realme UI 5.0 itself. It’s a derivation of Oppo’s ColorOS, which has also received touches of OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS along the way. This version is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and Realme claims that it will get three years of software updates. Unfortunately, there are simply way too many redundant and spammy apps that are preinstalled, and even when you first set up the phone, it feels like someone has been using it for a month.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-13.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVXhDNnYjDhx5sxi8vfLti.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have to be mindful to skip suggested app installs during initial setup, or else you’ll be saddled with even more apps before you even begin. What makes it worse is the non-stop notifications from some of them that clutter your notification shade. Thankfully, you can minimize this by disabling most of the suggestions within the apps, but it’s still annoying having to deal with it in the first place. </p><p>My other little niggle is with the phone’s always-on display (AOD) feature or the fact that you can’t exactly have it <em>always </em>on. There’s usually an option to enable this, but it’s absent from the 12 Plus 5G. This means the AOD disappears if you place the phone down and only activates again if you get a notification or move it a bit. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PK56W2NooPPNptFkpMab44" name="Realme-12-Plus-5G-14.jpg" alt="Realme 12 Plus 5G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PK56W2NooPPNptFkpMab44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, the 12 Plus 5G is a large phone and while that 190g of total weight is distributed well, the flat nature of the frame is not the most comfortable to hold and use, especially with one hand. The glossy finish of the side rail is also a pain to keep clean and as it attracts dust and fingerprints almost immediately. </p>

<p>As impressive as the features are of the Realme 12 Plus for its segment, there are other players with equally impressive rivals. The Poco X6 5G starts at roughly the same price but offers double the storage, and it even has a 512GB variant with 12GB of RAM for not much more. It packs a more potent Snapdragon SoC and Gorilla Glass Victus, while staying competitive in all other areas with Realme. </p><p>The iQoo Z9 is another recent offering with a feature set similar to the 12 Plus 5G. It, too, features a very capable Sony main camera sensor and a more power-efficient 4nm MediaTek SoC. </p>
<p>Realme’s own premium models are not too far off, either. By spending a bit more, you can get the Realme 12 Pro 5G, which has a more premium design, curved-edge display, a better chipset, and a portrait camera with 2x optical zoom. There’s also the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a> which has the unique transparent back with programmable notification lights and superb all-round performance. </p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a unique-looking phone without spending a lot   </li><li>You want certified water resistance </li><li> You want a vivid display and great battery life  </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if…</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want a lean version of Android </li><li> You want quality selfie and ultrawide cameras </li><li> You play a lot of heavy games  </li></ul>
<p>The Realme 12 Plus 5G is a solid budget offering that checks off most of the boxes if you’re shopping in this segment. Design has always been one of Realme’s strong suits, and it’s on full display here. The vegan leather finish and luxury watch-inspired camera dial on the back is sure to turn heads, as it makes it look more expensive than it actually is. It’s also water resistant, supports expandable storage, and has a headphone jack. The performance is decent, the display is bright and punchy, the battery life is great, and the main camera is reliable no matter the time of day. </p><p>A couple of things that you might not like is the annoying fluff in Realme UI. The redundant apps and their tendency to spam you with ads and unsolicited suggestions get annoying very quickly. The secondary cameras could have been a lot better, too, especially in low light. Finally, if you’re in the U.S., then you’re out of luck trying to get this. In fact, Realme hasn’t yet launched the 12 series outside a handful of Southeast Asian countries. Not to worry, as there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">good cheap Android phones</a> that are more easily accessible. </p>

<hr>
<p>Fairphone announces the launch of its "Fairbuds," which follow behind its smartphones in terms of user-reparability.</p><p>According to a press release, the Android and iOS-compatible earbuds are the smaller counterpart to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fairphone-fairbuds-xl-launch">Fairbuds XL</a> headphones from 2023. The new buds boast "premium" quality sound through the provided 11mm drivers. Fairphone adds users can enable active noise cancellation (ANC), which includes wind noise reduction, for a richer experience.</p><p>Additionally, the Fairbuds feature "crystal clear calling" for users indoors and outdoors, courtesy of its ENC (environmental noise canceling) functionality. Speaking of (no pun intended), the buds deliver six microphones in total so the device can capture every word. Moreover, the Fairbuds offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, giving users the ability to connect to two devices at once.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-example.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in its black colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the new Fairbuds is a talking point as Fairphone states the device delivers a "modular design" full of user-replaceable parts. Its specifications sheet states the Fairbuds feature seven spare parts that users can grab if something goes wrong. The parts available include new earbuds, battery and silicon ring, earbud tips, charging case shell, case core, and the case&apos;s battery.</p><p>If something goes wrong, users in Europe can grab these spare parts on the Fairphone webshop.</p><p>The Fairbuds contain a 45mAh battery, while the charging case features a 500mAh battery capacity. Fairphone states its buds can last for six hours on a full charge, with an additional 20 hours housed inside the charging case. As a quick pick-me-up, the Fairbuds can gain 1.5 hours of playback time in 10 minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1165px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.50%;"><img id="SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ" name="fairphone-fairbuds-white-colorway-launch.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in a white colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1165" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fairbuds have received an IP54 rating for sweat and water resistance. The press release states that the buds and cases were created with 70% recycled "fair materials." Software-wise, the company states that consumers can utilize their Fairbuds with Google Assistant and Apple&apos;s Siri for hands-free help.</p><p>Users in Europe looking for the Fairbuds will also receive a three-year warranty — which is a one-year extension of the brand&apos;s typical two-year plan.</p><p>Consumers across Europe can get their hands on Fairphone&apos;s latest Fairbuds for €149. The buds are available for pre-order beginning today (Apr. 9) on the Fairphone website and a few select European retailers. The company states the €149 price tag will vary from country to country in the region. Those interested will find the device in white and black colorways.</p>

<p>Bose Ultra Open earbuds went on sale on February 15, 2024, and are available in two colorways: Black and White Smoke. You can pick up a pair directly from Bose for $299 or from various retailers like Best Buy and Amazon for the same price. I’ve had them for a while now, and I don’t recall seeing this at launch, but on their website, you can also purchase them bundled with a wireless charging case cover <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds-earbuds-sets/SET-UOE-WLSCH.html">for an additional $48</a>, bringing the total cost to $348. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I won’t belabor the point since I made it in the verdict and intro, but aesthetically, I’m in love with this design. The fit and finish are premium down to how they’re seated into the case. With some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, you find yourself almost having to dig them out of their charging case, but the Bose Ultra kind of just sit on top of their seats in the case. Connected by strong magnets, when you hold them near, they snap into their seat. In front of their seats, you get bright LEDs that indicate the charging status of each earbud, which is in addition to the status LED on the front of the case.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A departure from traditional open-ear designs, they look as much like jewelry as they do consumer technology, so much so that I’m considering buying some earcuffs now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>No extra ear tips or wings with these as they are an ear cuff design with the speaker portion sitting inside the antitragus or antihelix, depending on how you position it. The battery is on the other end of the cuff and sits behind the ear. The fit is snug, but I’ve worn these for hours and only felt a bit of wear fatigue on my right ear, not my left.</p><p>At the gym, they don’t move at all! So you’re solid if you use these for dynamic HIIT workouts, and you don’t need to worry about sweat as they’re IPX4 water-resistant. Wearing them at my gym, I was surprised that the music from these wasn’t drowned out by the terrible selection playing on the house speakers.</p><p>As someone who spends a lot of time in the gym, I love the tactile buttons. They’re large, easy to operate, and quite responsive.</p>

<p>The default stereo sound is good, and the three-band equalizer in the Bose Music app makes it even better, but it’s the Immersive Audio and Auto Volume features that elevate the listening experience to the level of premium pricing. Open earbuds are known for having middling audio because of their positioning outside of the ear canal. That’s the whole point of the product segment, after all, but Bose went into the lab and designed OpenAudio technology, which combines a powerful transducer and an acoustic structure that does a magnificent job of delivering audio into your ear.</p><p>This is great because Immersive Audio, which is Bose’s version of spatial audio, really shines with the Bose Ultra Open earbuds. It’s a virtualization that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you and allows you to choose from one of two head tracking options: Still and Motion. “Still” keeps audio in a fixed position in front of you, so no matter where you turn your head, the audio comes from one direction. “Motion” moves with you and where you turn your head.</p><p>Listening to music and movies was a joy with Immersive Audio turned on. Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 Reality audio tracks.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You'll get breat audio from the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, but there are some things you'll want to take note of.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The full audio picture is nuanced though, so let’s briefly talk about that. The louder the Bose Ultra Open earbuds pump audio, the less robust it becomes. At lower volumes, the audio pumped into your ear is richer. There’s more perceived bass response and warmer mids, with treble quality staying consistent at various volumes.</p><p>This goes back to auditory masking. The whole idea of open ear is that your surroundings are just as — if not more important than — what’s coming in through your earbuds. So, at the loudest volumes, the audio isn’t meant to be overpowering but is meant to take a backseat to whatever is going on around you. At no time during my testing was this an issue when passively listening to music, but I can see there being some challenges in very noisy places when talking on the phone.</p><p>One day during my review period, I was out on a busy street having a conversation with my father, and his audio was definitely competing with the street noise. Again, that’s a feature, not a bug, but it’s something you should be aware of. I could hear him clearly, but I had to focus a bit more than if I was wearing some active noise-canceling earbuds.</p><p>That aside, other premium features I like are audible notifications and aptX Adaptive support. Audible notifications aren’t just beeps and tones but voice prompts and confirmations like speaking the name of the phone you’re connected to or telling you the battery charge status.</p><p>Battery life has also exceeded expectations, lasting six hours with Immersive Audio and Auto Volume activated. Bose says I should be getting just four and a half hours with Immersive on. My listening level was around 20% or 30% of max volume on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>’s volume slider, but with Auto Volume activated, it’s hard to say this was the real volume level being pumped out at any given time.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-auto-volume-and-auditory-masking"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: Auto Volume and auditory masking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-battery-barrel.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Auditory masking is defined as “when the perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another.” Unlike earbuds, which sit in your ear, open earbuds are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/transparency-mode-killed-open-ear-headphones-for-me">very vulnerable to masking caused by environmental noise.</a> I mean, that’s the entire point of them being open. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 tracks. 
</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To bring balance to the experience, Bose implemented a feature called Auto Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume of whatever you’re listening to based on the noise around you. In short, when you’re in a quiet office with the volume set fairly low since there’s no competing noise then step out onto the hustle and bustle of the urban street, the Ultra Open automatically increases audio volume to combat that auditory masking.</p><p>I kept this feature on most of the time, and it did a fantastic job of raising and lowering volume as I moved through different environments. I absolutely noticed it adjusting, but it was smooth, and I think I may have noticed more because I was listening for it and being critical for this review. In time, I think I might forget that it’s happening, and I could see this feature melting into the background.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-demonstrating-fit.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ok, I love almost everything about the Bose Ultra Open earbuds, except two things in particular, although one of them is just one of those “its strength can also be a weakness” conundrums.</p><p>By default, these $299 earbuds don’t come with a wireless charging case, even though their competitors include the feature. Never fear, as Bose “solves” this “problem” by giving you the option to purchase a $48 charging case accessory, bringing the total price to $348 if you want your earbuds equipped similarly to Sony’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">WF-1000XM5</a>, or Sennheiser’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a>. In 2024, for $299, the original case should already be Qi-enabled. Instead, you get USB-C charging only.</p><p>You won’t get multipoint right now, but Bose has a feature in the app that allows you to switch connections from one device to another. You can even program the earbuds with a shortcut to switch connected devices without taking your phone out. It’s a fairly functional workaround for not having multipoint.</p><p>Lastly, one feature that doesn’t actually need improvement but is more of a “caveat emptor” for those who may talk to work colleagues a lot or run with a partner is Auto Volume. As much as I enjoy the feature, I can see it becoming a nuisance for some, as it will likely increase your volume when you’re talking to people. You might find yourself deactivating the feature in that case so that your earbud’s audio isn’t competing with your real-world conversations.</p>

<p>In the open earbuds category, the only competition these have are the now aging original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-linkbuds-review">Sony Linkbuds with the donut holes</a>. In terms of contemporaries at this price point that I’ve had the chance to review, I don’t think there are any. </p><p>However, other open earbuds you can consider include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a>, which cost quite a bit less but feature rich audio and great battery life. You will have to deal with finicky touch controls, and there&apos;s no automatic wear detection or automatic shut-off, which can be a problem for those who forget to turn them off.</p><p>I don’t want to get too deep in the weeds here, but the point of open earbuds is that they don’t obstruct environmental noise, which means that, ideally, they don’t obstruct your ear canal. Knowing how soundwaves work, other than the donut hole Linkbuds, the Bose Ultra Open are among the only earbuds that don’t obstruct environmental noise or sit over your ear canal, they’re truly “open.”</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a pair of premium open earbuds, look no further. Bose Ultra Open earbuds are next-level open ears with some innovative audio features that are worth the price of admission.

<p>Google is hosting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/welcome-to-google-cloud-next24">Cloud Next 2024</a> conference where it got candid on new generative AI features for Workspace and the debut of a new app.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/workspace-cloud-next-2024/">Keyword post</a>, the company introduced its newest Workspace app, "Google Vids." The announcement states that this "AI-powered" video creation app can help users generate storyboards with several options for editing and stylizing. Google Vids is also said to feature voice-over capabilities. Users can pick between pre-set voices or use their own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC" name="google-vids-video-template-example.jpg" alt="An example of the various video templates for "Google Vids."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re having trouble with styles, Google Vids offers a range of templates users can look through. The company states its AI software will suggest scenes from stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Since this is going into Workspace, users can add others to collaborate on the video. Google adds that users can "share projects securely" directly from their browsers. Google Vids is expected to arrive in Workspace Labs in June 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP" name="google-docs-cloud-next-2024-ai-features-teased.jpg" alt="Google Docs is preparing to receive new customization features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Docs is preparing to pick up a new "tabs experience," according to the update post. The company states the new feature is designed to help users "organize related information" in a document. Better document customization is en route in the form of new cover images that extend the length of the page horizontally.</p><p>The company states this update to Docs will arrive "in the coming weeks."</p><p>Sheets is gaining new goodies for its table feature. Google says this update will make it easier for Workspace users to "format and organize" their data through its upcoming design refresh. A new array of templates will accompany this, making it easy for users to hop into a ready-made sheet without beginning from zero.</p><p>These updates for Sheets will appear "in the coming weeks" as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.19%;"><img id="6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa" name="google-gmail-cloud-next-2024-gemini-polish.jpg" alt="Gmail is receiving new voice capabilities for "Help me write" and Gemini's "Polish" arrives for Workspace customers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="291" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gmail made a quick appearance with Google preparing to roll out an update to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">Help me write</a>" that brings voice capabilities. Gemini will be included in a coming update for Gmail as it delivers a way for users to turn their notes into an email. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14199860?hl=en">Gemini in Gmail</a> is available through Workspace Labs but appears slowly as the company rolls it out.</p><p>Google states Gemini Enterprise, Business, and Google One AI Premium customers will be able to take advantage of these new tools.</p><p>Cloud Next 2024 showed Google&apos;s willingness to fine-tune some other areas of Workspace, starting with Meet. The company is planning on launching "Translate for me in Meet" in the next few months, which brings automatic detection and translation for captions. To go with this, Google is adding support for 52 additional languages.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this will only be available to customers who purchase the new AI Meetings and Messaging add-on for $10 "per user per month." The company states this feature will arrive in June, and the add-on can be attached to "select" Workspace plans.</p><p>Lastly, "AI Security" is on its way to select Workspace plans as a $10 add-on. Google says the feature will let IT teams protect sensitive files for an entire company in Drive. AI Security does piggyback off Google&apos;s AI software. The AI is said to evaluate, classify, and protect files for users continuously.</p><p>AI security is available today (Apr. 9) for Workspace users.</p>

<ul><li>Automattic, owners of WordPress, announced that it has acquired Beeper in its quest to bring better communication to users.</li><li>Sources claim that this merger was agreed upon for $125 million.</li><li>Automattic states that its acquisition of Beeper will roll into its plans to merge it with its recently acquired messaging platform, Texts.com.</li><li>Beeper also announced it has launched its new, revamped messaging app on Google's Play Store today (Apr. 9) for all Android users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Automattic, owners of WordPress, has reportedly cemented a deal to acquire the messaging platform Beeper.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://automattic.com/2024/04/09/automattic-acquires-beeper/">press release</a>, the company states its recent acquisition of Beeper is part of its larger narrative to "push the boundaries of messaging." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-multi-service-messaging-app-beeper-for-125m/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a> cites sources close to the matter who state the deal was made for $125 million. Automattic teases that there&apos;s more in store with its acquisition of Beeper, as the messaging platform already supports 14 different messaging services in one app.</p><p>The post adds that Automattic will look to merge Beeper&apos;s team with Texts.com, a service the company acquired late last year. This is its "next step toward the dream of combining all online conversations in a safe, secure, and effective way."</p><p>Automattic states users can expect a "streamlined" experience once the merger is completed. When it does, Texts will fall under the Beeper brand. The company adds end-to-end encryption (E2EE), a "dozen" app integrations, and more.</p><p>Automattic doesn&apos;t have an exact timeframe for users to expect its Texts and Beeper merger to take place, but it says more updates will come when its "phased plan" is ready.</p><p>During TechCrunch&apos;s conversation with Beeper&apos;s founder Eric Migicovsky, he said the eventual plan is to manage chats under its new protocol, "Matrix." The protocol is said to feature an E2EE open-source client, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-mastodon">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Migicovsky commented on the acquisition, stating, "It was either time to raise more funding or find a buyer" due to Beeper&apos;s high costs.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/">Beeper announced</a> that its new app on Android has finally launched on the Play Store. The new app brings a fresh design, the ability for users to modify their chat networks, full message search, and more. The post states that there isn&apos;t any support for iMessage, although the U.S. government&apos;s lawsuit against Apple, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24071226/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-apple-beeper-mini">FCC involvement</a>, could turn things around.</p><p>Beeper and Apple had been at it ever since the former found a way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-lawmakers-urge-doj-investigation-apple-vs-beeper">reverse-engineer iMessage</a> and bring its capabilities to Android. Apple was quick to shut it down, prompting the gaze of U.S. lawmakers who wrote a letter to the Department of Justice stating the company&apos;s actions could be "anti-competitive." Resistance didn&apos;t stop as Apple soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-drops-imessage-integration-after-apple-bans-linked-macs">started banning</a> users of Beeper Cloud and Mini who used Macs.</p><p>The company stated it removed access to iMessage for users due to "spam." Beeper then turned and disabled iMessage support in Cloud, and it&apos;s not clear if it will ever be restored.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is bringing OxygenOS 14.0.0.505 update for Indian OnePlus 12R users.</li><li>It brings an object/person removal tool similar to the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12.</li><li>The update is incremental, with a broader rollout expected in the next few days.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out a new April 2024 update for the OnePlus 12R for the Indian region. The changelog of the latest firmware indicates that it is bringing the unwanted object removal or people tool for the photos captured on the device.</p><p>In the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1568977884347891713">community post</a>, OnePlus shared the firmware details for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, dubbed <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.505</strong> version. It is currently rolling out to the Indian OnePlus 12R users in batches. The prominent aspect of the latest update is the AIGC Remover, which was earlier available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> users.</p>
<p>The latest feature on the OnePlus 12R will allow users to "remove unwanted objects or people and make your photos look cleaner." It sounds and works very similar to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> feature, which has been available for Pixel phones for a while now.</p><p>Meanwhile, OnePlus recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-launch">announced</a> a new Pixel-inspired AI feature dubbed AI Eraser, which lets users substitute unwanted objects in a photo. The AI Eraser is available for the company&apos;s prominent handsets, such as the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus Open, and the Nord CE 4.</p><p>The other highlights from the changelog comprise the ability to create photo collages without frames in photos. A new nifty shortcut has been added to turn on the flashlight by pressing the Volume Down rocker on the OnePlus 12R for a long time. Users can also adjust volumes for apps individually with a new "app-specific" feature added with the update.</p><p>There are several other improvements included with the latest update, which are per the changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Improves the volume bar's design for ease of use and visual consistency.</li><li>Improves the touch control experience in certain scenarios.</li><li>Improves the compatibility of USB connections between phones and cars, and phones and PCs.</li><li>Improves system stability.</li></ul>
<p>As mentioned, the rollout is incremental and for the Indian region. The broader rollout is expected in the next few days, notes OnePlus.</p>
