<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s sales of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> are already proving to be better than those of the Galaxy S23 series, and the latest numbers show us why. According to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">data from Counterpoint Research</a>, sales of the Galaxy S24 series rose by 8% in the first three weeks when compared to last year&apos;s early sales numbers, and the S24 Plus is driving up these numbers.</p><p>When comparing Samsung&apos;s flagship sales, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy 24 Plus</a> still trails the base S24 and the Ultra, which have 21% and 52% share, respectively. However, the Galaxy S24 Plus has seen a massive 54% growth when compared to the Galaxy S23 Plus and grabbed 21% of S24 sales.</p><p>Notably, the base S24 only saw a meager 4% growth, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> actually lost share compared to the Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p>

<p>Counterpoint also points out that preorder volumes were up across the S24 series in the U.S., Europe, and China, proving how popular these devices are.</p><p>Jeff Fieldhack, Counterpoint Research&apos;s research director for North America, highlights that while S24 growth is still under 10%, it&apos;s still within the high single digits, which is encouraging. "And in Samsung&apos;s biggest market – the US – we&apos;re seeing YoY growth in the mid-teens – solid numbers especially considering the tough February. And considering we&apos;re still really at the beginning stages of the coming GenAI smartphone boom, there is plenty of runway for more growth."</p>

<p>Over the years, Samsung&apos;s Plus model has been seen as nothing more than a larger version of the base model, complete with a larger battery and faster charging. The device did not offer much difference beyond that when compared to the base, especially once Samsung reduced the display resolution to FHD+, meaning the choice between the two phones solely came down to size. That said, the popularity of the newest Plus model underscores some of the changes Samsung made to the device to set it apart from the base model further.</p><p>As I highlighted in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus review</a>, the move back to a QHD+ resolution offers a refreshingly crisp picture that&apos;s much more appropriate for a large display. Of course, sometimes size is all that matters for some, which is why the smaller Galaxy S24 remains popular for users who prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android phones</a>. That said, larger devices appeal to those who enjoy viewing content on their smartphones, which is further enhanced by the improved brightness and higher resolution.</p><p>However, the real improvement comes with the bump in RAM to 12GB, which does wonders for app management. It does a much better job of keeping apps running in the background than phones I&apos;ve reviewed with 8GB of RAM. Counterpoint Research also highlights the benefits it brings to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, noting that 12GB is the "minimum spec for a large language model to run well" and highlighting the importance of higher-spec phones in the push for on-device AI.</p>

<p>"The big driver this year for Samsung&apos;s key flagship has been the S24 Plus model," states<strong> </strong>Minsoo Kang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. "It&apos;s hitting the sweet spot on pricing, nudging upgraders as well as specs to support new users wanting optimized on-device AI."</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus retails for $999 before any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">deals and offers</a> are taken into account, and there are plenty of those to help bring the price down. That&apos;s already $300 less than the S24 Ultra, which saw a price bump at launch and likely contributed to its slight sales decline. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera system</a> is still impressive, not everyone may find the extra sensor or built-in S Pen worth the extra cost.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus finally makes a case for its existence, being more than just a larger S24 by offering more Ultra-like specs at a cheaper price and saving the "extra" features for those willing to pay for them. Of course, these are early sales numbers, so we&apos;ll have to see how the Plus model fares in the long run, but this should give Samsung some reason to keep it around after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-launch-rumors">early rumors</a> suggested the company would omit the middle phone from its lineup.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google DeepMind announces its newest project, a "generalist AI agent" that aims to assist users in carrying out tasks while playing a game.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/">DeepMind</a>, the latest AI is called the Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent, or "SIMA" for short. Google&apos;s AI-focused division states SIMA can "perceive and understand a variety of environments, then take actions to achieve an instructed goal."</p><p>To work, DeepMind adds that SIMA needs what the user sees and "natural-language" instructions provided by the user. The AI is said to use a user&apos;s standard keyboard and mouse inputs to move a user&apos;s character within the game world. By extension, the post adds that SIMA can "interact with any virtual environment."</p><p>SIMA has been tested on 600 basic skills, such as turning left, climbing ladders, opening a game&apos;s pause menu for settings, and more. Google states that SIMA can also perform "simple tasks" in 10 seconds. A few of these tasks involve driving a car in Goat Simulator 3 and telling SIMA to walk to your spaceship in No Man&apos;s Sky.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.58%;"><img id="2rSejMgM7btxP9mKqR3xsJ" name="google-deepmind-sima-gaming-assistant.jpg" alt="The various models and tools Google used to train SIMA." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2rSejMgM7btxP9mKqR3xsJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="433" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To get SIMA to where it is now, Google states it partnered with game developers like Hello Games, the makers of No Man&apos;s Sky, and Tuxedo Labs, who made Teardown. SIMA was also taught using an environment built in the Unity engine called "Construction Lab." Through this, SIMA learned how to manipulate objects and better understood the physical world inside a video game.</p><p>Google also leaned on real-life gamers as an initial approach to understanding how SIMA could work. They monitored them as a pair, with one player playing the game while the other fed them instructions on how to complete a task.</p><p>In total, Google&apos;s DeepMind trained SIMA using nine different games, all within their respective genre. During their study, the division discovered that an AI agent trained across multiple games delivered better results than a system trained on one. More research showed that SIMA&apos;s reliance on language is paramount to its performance.</p><p>Without user input, SIMA is said to behave "in an appropriate but aimless manner." DeepMind observed SIMA exploring and gathering resources but wouldn&apos;t follow the game&apos;s objective unless strictly told to do so.</p><p>SIMA is still in its infancy, but Google is seemingly confident in its "language-driven" capabilities to assist gamers. More importantly, more research is reportedly necessary as Google wants SIMA to understand "higher-level language instructions to achieve more complex goals."</p>

<p>We&apos;re crossing over the midway point in March, and Google is starting to tease its upcoming I/O 2024 event.</p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/googledevs/status/1768313667185991746">latest I/O teaser</a> on X is accompanied by a colorful puzzle that users can complete to discover the date of its upcoming event. The company is calling on anyone and everyone to complete its latest puzzle, which is filled with twists and turns as it moves along the progress bar.</p><p>Once completed, the I/O 2024 date will be revealed.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s puzzle this year involves creating a path for a little marble to roll across until it reaches the end (the finish line). There are fifteen puzzles in total users can complete, and doing so will push along that progress bar to reveal I/O&apos;s date.</p><p>Users can use their WASD keys if they&apos;re on a desktop to select a piece of track from the pile to place (using spacebar) on the puzzle to the right. Similarly, you can drag your pieces using your mouse.</p><p>Once your pieces are all set, and you&apos;re certain your path will get the marble to the end, Google will prompt you to "run" it. The previously flat puzzle turns 3D as you watch the marble roll along until it crosses the finish line, which springs up, spouting celebratory confetti everywhere.</p><p>Users can then continue on to the next puzzle, furthering the community&apos;s progress.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the I/O 2024 puzzle is nearly one-third of the way toward completion. So, we&apos;re likely a few hours away before the community can rally together with a much stronger presence to complete the task. Users can click "I&apos;d rather observe" on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/puzzle/">I/O teaser page</a> to view this progress bar.</p><p>This year&apos;s I/O teaser is relatively straightforward, unlike the one last year, which left people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2023-puzzle">scratching their heads</a>. Speaking of, the date revealed last time was on May 10, to be specific. Google usually holds its I/O events around May, so it&apos;s not insane to think we&apos;re looking at that happening again.</p><p>The only question is <em>when </em>its event will take place, so we need to get those marbles to the finish line.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s community has completed enough progress on its fun marble game to reveal its I/O 2024 date. The event will be hosted on May 14, per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/">official page</a>.</p><p>Users will find a countdown to the event, alongside an option to play Google&apos;s fun marble game if they didn&apos;t get a chance to. You may also register for the event to attend Google&apos;s keynote speeches, presentations, and more sessions about its latest projects.</p><p>Google will likely continue to have a mix of live-streamed content and sessions for developers and product updates. The company will also reveal what time folks should tune in, alongside its schedule once we get closer to the date.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re on the hunt for the best cheap Android phone, you&apos;ve come to the right place. Here, you&apos;ll find all of the best devices for $500 or less, ranging from flagship-quality smartphones to decent budget models. You can even score a Samsung Galaxy for five Benjamins or less.</p><p>We&apos;ve thoroughly researched all of the picks in our guides, so you can rest easy knowing there won&apos;t be any surprises later on. Needless to say, with phones this cheap, you can&apos;t expect outstanding performance all across the board. As the old saying goes, "you get what you pay for". Still, you might be pleasantly surprised by the quality of some of these phones. Our top pick, the Google Pixel 7a, for example, boasts incredible camera software and uses the same chipset found in the Google Pixel 7 Pro, which used to be our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> when it launched.</p>

<p>Considering how much we loved its predecessor, the Pixel 6a, Google had some seriously big shoes to fill with the Google Pixel 7a. Thankfully, not only did they deliver, but actually <em>exceeded</em> our expectations. We even went so far as to call the phone the "best Pixel Google has ever built" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">our Google Pixel 7a review</a>.</p><p>How is this possible? With this cheap Android phone, it all comes down to balance. With a starting price of just $499, the Pixel 7a offers some truly outstanding bang for the buck, thanks to specs like the Google Tensor G2 chipset (the same processor found in the more-expensive Pixel 7 Pro), glorious haptics, and camera tech that rivals some of the best Android phones that money can buy. In fact, pound for pound, we found that the Pixel 7a performed just as well as the base model Pixel 7 ($599) in most of our initial tests.</p><p>You also get Android 13 with all of the usual Pixel-exclusive features straight out of the box, plus five years of Pixel updates guaranteed. It&apos;s the first A-series Pixel to come with wireless charging (limited to 5W). Sure, you only get a 90Hz refresh rate, and the battery life may not be the best in the business, but you&apos;re getting a truly unrivaled experience for less than $500.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 12R is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">best unlocked phones</a> you can buy in the US, but those looking for a deal through their carrier will be out of luck. If you can plonk down the cash though, you&apos;re in for a real treat. At a starting price of just under $500, the 12R gets you a flagship processor, premium design and build quality, a brilliant AMOLED display, and the quickest charging ever in this segment.</p><p>OnePlus&apos; R series of phones is essentially a homage to its roots of making "flagship killer" smartphones, and the 12R is the first of its kind to finally get a US launch. We&apos;re talking Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED display, and 100W wired charging. If that&apos;s not enough to get you excited, the 12R follows the same design as the flagship 12, which means you could easily fool someone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-cases-for-oneplus-12r/">right case</a>.</p><p>In our review, we simply loved how the 12R felt every bit as powerful as the OnePlus 12. Whether it was multitasking or gaming, the phone handled everything without breaking a sweat. Benchmark numbers are a bit lower than 2024&apos;s flagships, but that isn&apos;t something most people would care about.</p><p>The main camera really stands out, delivering flagship-grade performance in daylight and low light. The ultrawide is a bit inferior in comparison, but is still good enough for this price segment. The software is slick and fluid, and the 12R is slated to get three Android OS upgrades. Overall, there&apos;s very little to be disappointed about, especially when you consider how much you&apos;re paying.</p>

<p>The Phone 2a is Nothing&apos;s first-ever budget smartphone, and it carries the same quirky DNA as its pricier siblings. The transparent back panel, meticulous attention to detail, and the Glyph lights are some of the unique features that make it the best-looking phone in this segment.</p><p>With our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-questions-answered">brief time</a> on the phone, we&apos;re already mighty impressed at what the company has pulled off here. The polycarbonate build doesn&apos;t feel as premium as the exposed aluminium rails of its bigger sibling, but it&apos;s still light and durable. You get fewer LEDs around the camera module for the Glyph lights, but the functionality is still solid. The 6.7-inch AMOLED display is pretty to look at, and colors and brightness levels are satisfactory. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro SoC, which is more than adequate for casual use.</p><p>The Phone 2a has a large 5,000mAh battery with relatively quick charging. The camera specs on paper are also quite good, and from what we&apos;ve tested so far, they perform very well compared to the other phones of its class.</p><p>The only catch with the Nothing Phone 2a is that you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-why-nothing-isnt-launching-the-phone-2a-in-the-us">can&apos;t buy it outright</a> in the US. The company doesn&apos;t have any plans at the moment to put it on open sale. However,  you can try your luck getting it via Nothing&apos;s developer program from its website for $349.</p>

<p>The Galaxy A Series continues to be one of Samsung’s greatest achievements, with solid specs and nice designs on mid-range and low-end phones. We were massive fans of the Galaxy A53, and its follow-up does not disappoint, delivering flagship-level specs at half the normal flagship price.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Samsung Galaxy A54</a> boasts a typically vibrant 6.4-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate alongside the ultra-efficient octa-core Exynos 1380 processor, a large 5,000mAh battery, and 6GB of RAM with 128GB storage capacity. The camera software is excellent here as well, with a 50MP primary lens and a 32MP selfie shooter. Plus, you get a lot of the camera features found in Samsung’s latest flagship series, such as Nightography capabilities and Object Eraser.</p><p>As with all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones"><u>best Samsung phones</u></a>, device longevity is the focus of the Galaxy A54. The phone is set to receive four OS upgrades and up to five years of security updates, so you can plan to use the A54 for years to come.

<p>As we found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">our Nord N30 5G review</a>, this affordable phone from OnePlus consistently performs like a phone twice its price, thanks to specs like a Snapdragon 695 5G processor, 8GB of RAM, and even 64GB of expandable storage out of the box. On top of that, it&apos;s got an AMOLED display on the front, which is unusual for phones in this price range.</p><p>As you would expect from an AMOLED panel, the colors are gorgeous, the black levels are perfect, and everything just looks great. It&apos;s even got a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The cameras are also above and beyond the level of quality of most phones in this price range.

<p>Samsung offers a lot of smartphones for $200 with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15 5G</a>, making it an amazing budget option for your kids&apos; first phone. A lot has been improved from the Galaxy A13 5G which used to be on our list, such as a better AMOLED display, the latest version of Android, quicker wired charging, and upgraded cameras.</p><p>The visual aspect has also been overhauled as the A15 5G looks more modern, and from the rear, it looks similar to Samsung&apos;s pricier A-series models or even its S series. However, you can&apos;t expect anything more than a plastic build at this price, and the Blue Black colorway tends to look a bit cheap in our experience.</p><p>Coming back to the positives, the 6.5-inch AMOLED display has a Full-HD resolution which means icons and text end up looking decently sharp. Colors are also vibrant and punchy, making it great for binge-watching videos. The MediaTek SoC can handle basic apps well enough, but the problem is the stingy 4GB of RAM which tends to make app-launching and multitasking painfully slow. Thankfully, a microSD card slot is supported for expanding the 128GB of storage.</p><p>The cameras on the Galaxy A15 5G pleasantly surprised us. The main 50MP snapper can capture more than passable photos, and did the macro camera for a change. The ultrawide was quite underwhelming, but at least it&apos;s there when you absolutely need it. Battery life is one of the main highlights of this phone. The 5,000mAh battery can easily get you through one full day, and maybe more depending on your usage.</p><p><em>For more options in this price range, check out our guide to the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200"><em>best Android phones under $200</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>It can be challenging to keep track of all the value phones Motorola has in its lineup, but one that manages to stand out is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review" target="_blank">Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)</a>. Along with being one of the few Android phones that comes with a built-in stylus, it&apos;s also just a perfect combination of specs, features, and value.</p><p>You&apos;re getting a large 6.6-inch display that looks great, and thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, this one will feel a lot more expensive than it is because of the smooth presentation. There&apos;s also ample performance thanks to the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 processor, along with 128GB of built-in storage and a very large 5,000mAh battery. Given the affordable price of the G Stylus, these are all impressive specifications.</p><p>As the name implies, the main draw to the Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) is its built-in stylus experience. It&apos;s certainly not the most premium stylus we&apos;ve ever used, but it works well enough for drawing, note-taking, etc. It can also be stored seamlessly at the bottom of the phone when you aren&apos;t using it, which is a nice touch that ties the whole experience together.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-cheap-android-phone-to-buy-2">What is the best cheap Android phone to buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kiiwUvoYW3wfNHxJPokZRh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A15-.jpg" alt="The home screen on a Samsung Galaxy A15 5G on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiiwUvoYW3wfNHxJPokZRh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, the Google Pixel 7a is the best phone under $500 — but fortunately, we&apos;re living in a day and age that&apos;s full of excellent and affordable smartphones.</p><p>So, how should you choose a cheap Android phone?</p><p>Most people have a budget to stick to, and that’s where deciding the right budget-minded phone comes into play. You want to pick a phone that’s not just in your budget, but one that will last a while, too. That way, you’re not spending even more on yet another phone upgrade shortly down the road.</p><p>But before you even think about a phone’s processor, cameras, or storage space, you need to think about connectivity. All modern phones support Bluetooth earbuds and Wi-Fi, but not all phones support all cellular networks. Make sure the phone you’re looking for supports your network of choice, especially if you are choosing an unlocked phone from the list.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The quickest way to end up with a phone that feels sluggish and old is to undersell yourself on the phone’s chipset.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Next, keep a phone&apos;s processor in mind before pressing that buy button. The quickest way to end up with a phone that feels sluggish and old is to undersell yourself on the phone’s chipset.</p><p>Lots of phones feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors, but that doesn’t mean all of them are worthwhile. Unless your budget absolutely doesn’t allow for anything faster, you probably want to avoid any phone powered by a Snapdragon 400-series or lower chipset. Those phones are really only good as communication devices and for browsing the web or social media.</p><p>Likewise, MediaTek’s Dimensity series of processors are the only ones you want to consider from the company. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-stylus-5g-review" target="_blank">TCL Stylus 5G</a> — which is only available at T-Mobile — sport the excellent MediaTek Dimensity 700 5G chipset, which is speedy enough for just about anything you throw at it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mJPH2sb7kC2hkuoNaL9hi6" name="derrek-lee-moto-g-stylus-5g-2022.jpg" alt="Moto G Stylus 5G (2022)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJPH2sb7kC2hkuoNaL9hi6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Storage isn’t much of a concern these days thanks to excellent cloud storage services like Google Photos.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You’ll also want to make sure your new phone has at least 6GB of RAM if you’re ever planning on doing more than one thing at a time on it. Less RAM means the phone has less memory to store opened apps, creating a scenario where apps take a long time to load and often have to reload if you switch back and forth between apps.</p><p>Storage isn’t much of a concern these days, thanks to excellent cloud storage services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos" target="_blank">Google Photos</a>, which can offload the photos and videos you’ve taken to a safe and secure cloud drive. That means they not only won’t be taking up precious space on your phone, but they’ll also be securely backed up in case something happens to your phone.</p><p>Services like Google Photos also archive your photos and make it easy to search for even the most minute details, like your old black and white cat or the blue shoes you wore to that wedding several years ago.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>With a few exceptions, the cameras on the phones above will all deliver a good experience in most lighting conditions.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Cameras on smartphones have become increasingly important over the years, and, with a few exceptions, the phones above will all deliver a good experience in most lighting conditions. As these are less expensive phones, you’ll need to be aware that most models will only take great pictures in adequate light. Phones like the Google Pixel 7a or Samsung Galaxy A54 5G offer great low-light support, and that function is becoming more common on phones even under $300 these days.</p><p>No phone on this list has poor battery life, but some folks might have a unique need for a smartphone to last more than a single day on a full charge. We’ve noted that several options above will offer that but specifically highlight one phone as having the best battery life of them all.</p>

<p>Most Android phones these days are pretty good, but a few stand above the rest. We&apos;ve outlined many of our favorites here but if you want a few more options and are on a tighter budget, we&apos;ve got picks for the best phones under $300 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-under-100" target="_blank">best phones under $100</a> . Each of these categories comes with a few concessions but, if you&apos;re looking for a specific niche — like a stylus — you&apos;ll find a few more options there.</p><p>Just remember, though, that you&apos;re paying hundreds less than what it costs to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. While those phones might offer faster processors, better cameras, or brighter screens, they&apos;re extremely expensive to replace if they accidentally get broken. Splurging on the best overall phone that throws in everything and the kitchen sink isn&apos;t always the ideal solution — especially when you&apos;re looking to cut costs.</p>

The headphones have never been cheaper than this, so if you want to beat the crowds ahead of the big sale, now&apos;s a great time to buy.</p><p>The Sony WH-1000XM5 earned the top spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> that money can buy, due in part to the QN1 processor (which provides some cutting-edge active noise cancellation), endlessly customizable sound profiles, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. As we note in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">our XM5 review</a>, the biggest problem that the headphones have is the price, which is why this historic discount is such a big deal. </p>

<p>Head to Amazon today and you'll score a whopping 18% discount on the Sony WH-1000XM5, which are our favorite headphones on the market. This is a return to the lowest price that we've ever seen on the innovative cans, matching the discounts we saw during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale events last fall. </p>
<p>If you'd rather buy from Walmart, it's worth noting that the retailer is currently beating Amazon's price by a few dollars, knocking the headphones down to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-WH-1000XM5-The-Best-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Black/386006068"><strong>just $324.99</strong></a>.

<p>If the XM5 are still a bit too expensive for you, consider their predecessor, the Sony WH-1000XM4.

They're also a full $80 cheaper than the XM5, which is no small amount.  </p>

<ul><li>ASUS reveals the Zenfone 11 Ultra, which immediately displays its departure from last year's launch as it features a larger 6.7-inch LTPO screen.</li><li>The device contains Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, internally, and a triple camera array with a 50MP primary lens, 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 32MP telephoto lens.</li><li>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra is available today (Mar. 14), starting at $899.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>ASUS is launching its latest Zenfone 11 Ultra today (Mar. 14), which breaks the series&apos; typical small form factor for a larger overall experience.</p><p>As detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.asus.com/us/mobile-handhelds/phones/zenfone/zenfone-11-ultra/">ASUS</a>, the Zenfone 11 Ultra takes a whole new approach as it features a 6.7-inch LTPO display. This is a notable departure from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10&apos;s</a> 5.9-inch display. The 11 Ultra&apos;s screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and can reach a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz for gaming purposes. Naturally, ASUS states the device can reach a refresh rate max of 122Hz while scrolling across the web and in apps.</p><p>Internally, ASUS has outfitted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> with Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. The Taiwanese company states the chip clocks in at 3.3GHz and is paired with the Adreno 750 GPU.</p><p>The 11 Ultra&apos;s chassis is based on the gaming-focused ROG Phone 8 but offers a few changes. ASUS states that consumers will find glossy and matte finish options for the device&apos;s minimalistic rear panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DXZMhmsJzuC92JrP353dKR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-15.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DXZMhmsJzuC92JrP353dKR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Changes continue with the 11 Ultra&apos;s rear triple camera array. Instead of featuring two (rather large) lenses like the Zenfone 10, the lenses are housed in a rounded corner square container. The primary lens utilizes a Sony IMX980 50MP lens featuring Gimbal Stabilizer 3.0, 6-Axis Hybrid, and 2x lossless zoom.</p><p>This is accompanied by a 13MP ultra-wide lens with a 120-degree FOV (field of view) and a 32MP telephoto lens with 3x zoom. The 11 Ultra&apos;s front-facing selfie camera sits at 32MP. ASUS states it&apos;s upgraded the selfie camera with a 90-degree FOV to help users get everyone in the photo in one take.</p><p>AI has worked its way onto the Zenfone 11 Ultra to aid its camera and for on-device tasks. The company adds its AI software can assist users in searching for specific "events, times, locations, and objects" in their photos. Additionally, AI provides noise-cancellation capabilities while on a call. The phone&apos;s camera benefits from "Portrait Video," which is said to piggyback off an AI algorithm that helps provide a "natural" depth of field effect.</p><p>A few features are arriving with the Zenfone 11 Ultra in beta, such as AI Call Translator, AI Transcript for the phone&apos;s recorder app, and AI Wallpaper.</p>

<p>A 5,500mAh battery keeps your Zenfone 11 Ultra going. ASUS states the battery supports its HyperCharge for 65W fast-charging capabilities, alongside Qi 1.3 wireless charging.</p><p>Consumers will find the device available with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The Zenfone 11 Ultra is available to purchase today (Mar. 14) with an $899 starting price. What&apos;s more, consumers will find the device in four colorways: Skyline Blue, Eternal Black, Misty Grey, and Desert Sand.</p>

It’s not the first time chat filters have appeared in a beta version of the app.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-16-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-beta-android-chat-filters-unread-groups/">Android Police</a>), the latest beta update – version 2.24.6.16 – is rolling out a feature that allows users to filter chats. This version of the chat filter feature offers three filtering options: All, Unread, and Groups. The new filters are positioned as a new row of lozenge-shaped buttons at the top of the screen, just below the top app bar. </p><p>Perhaps significantly, there is no contacts filter on this feature version. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-14-17-whats-new/">Last July</a>, a previous beta test took place, and there were additional filters, including Personal and Business. In September, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-19-7-whats-new/">another beta update</a> saw these two filters renamed as Contacts and Groups. </p>

<p>It’s unclear why the contacts filter has been removed, but it is likely to be based on user feedback. In theory, chat filters will enable users to find specific conversations more quickly and easily, improving the user experience as a result.    </p><p>While WhatsApp is relatively simple to use, anyone who has many conversations on the go will have experienced the challenge of trying to find a specific chat. Allowing users to filter for unread messages or group chats could make it a lot easier to locate and access specific messages.</p>
<p>According to WABetaInfo, this feature is currently available to just a few beta testers, but the expectation is that it will become available to more users “over the coming weeks.”</p><p>We’ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-web-favorites-in-development">previously reported</a> that WhatsApp web is working on a favorites feature, as well as similar developments on the iOS version of WhatsApp. This suggests that chat filters could be a prominent part of future planned updates to the stable version of WhatsApp.</p>

I have incredibly fond memories of the early days of modern consumer VR — specifically with the HTC Vive — and its SteamVR-powered experience. I&apos;ve spent hundreds of hours in PC-only headsets over the years, and while all of them used different tracking methods, controllers, displays, and other components, all of them have been peppered with the exact same problems: they require as many hours of troubleshooting as you&apos;ll plan to play on them.</p>

<p>It&apos;s more than likely that I&apos;m cursed in some regard to PC gaming, but I&apos;ve never had an easy time of the effort. I&apos;m aware of the flak I&apos;m going to receive from the hardcore community for this article, but I know I&apos;m not alone in my struggles. PC gaming seldom works for me and, even when it does, the trade-offs are almost often never worth the effort that goes into making it work.</p><p>This past week, Meta relaunched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/meta-quest-link-improvements/">Meta Quest Link software</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, Quest Pro, and Quest 2, and it made me wonder if the new improvements would be a notable improvement on my historically bad experience.</p><p>Turns out, it wasn&apos;t.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664" name="windows-blue-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A blue screen of death on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T4rTxG3wQwaQSVBCkNj664.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I come from an IT background of 15 years where I spent time as both a help desk technician and a systems administrator. I&apos;m extremely familiar with computers, the individual components, and have been since I was a kid. I built my first computer from scratch when I was 12 and was an avid PC gamer for most of my life.</p><p>But the years of tweaking and troubleshooting have grown on my nerves. Things were never worse than when I was knee-deep in the PCVR scene with the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift S, two PC headsets that I loved but didn&apos;t love me back. I can recall spending an hour troubleshooting audio problems nearly every night when my wife and I would play Beat Saber, and the problems never got better as the headsets improved.</p><p>Today, PCVR has the potential to be more effortless than ever. Realistically, all you need is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5841245619310585">Steam Link app</a> on your Meta Quest headset, and you can wirelessly play PCVR games with almost no setup. That is, so long as you have one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wifi-6-routers">best routers</a> that&apos;s capable of delivering low latency and high bandwidth between your PC and Quest.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Somehow, even a wired PCVR experience will fail me when it should be the simplest method to use.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, for me, my old Wi-Fi 6 mesh router stopped working and I&apos;m using an older router with less-than-adequate wireless speeds for PCVR use. That means I&apos;ve got to wire up my headset like it was 2016 if I want to play PCVR games.</p><p>Simple enough, you say. Just plug the thing in and launch the Quest Link app, right? I wish.</p><p>Over the weekend, I jumped into the latest beta of Contractors Showdown to see how different the game looked on PC versus the native Quest version. There are some marked differences between the two, but I was surprised by how soft the image was compared to the native Quest version.</p><p>I tweaked some settings but could never get rid of that telltale "compressed" look. It was a good enough experience, but I was left at least a little disappointed by the result. Still, it worked well enough... that is, until the next day when I went to play another round with some friends.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZdwFzQwVwjB5y7MivpnUfG" name="Meta-quest-3-pc-link-cable-03.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 3 sitting on top of a PC with a Link cable attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZdwFzQwVwjB5y7MivpnUfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I plugged the cable in and heard the good old "da dunk" connection sound Windows makes when something gets plugged in and recognized. Except the Quest Link software said the headset wasn&apos;t connected. I then put the Quest on, clicked the Quest Link button on the dashboard, and it said no PC found.</p><p>So I did what any self-respecting IT expert would do: I turned it off and on again.</p><p>Then I unplugged it, left it off for 20 seconds, and plugged it back in again. Wash, rinse, repeat. I even tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Kuject-Transfer-Charging-Chargers/dp/B08MZFS4SY/">another cable</a> since I&apos;ve got two or three lying around, but the PC refused to recognize my connected headset.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Gaming on a Quest is so much more effortless than any other way to VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Ironically, Air Link worked immediately when I clicked the toggle in the headset, but I quickly remembered why I could not play this way. The latency between my movements and the in-game character&apos;s movements made the game completely unplayable. And the fact that a VHS tape delivered better quality than my wireless streaming setup didn&apos;t help things.</p><p>Instead, I unplugged everything and started up the native Contractors Showdown game running on the Quest itself. Guess what? <strong>It worked.</strong></p><p>It always works when it&apos;s on Quest — aside from a scant few hiccups here and there — and that&apos;s part of why I love the Quest experience so much. It&apos;s a console. You put it on your head and play. It&apos;s <em>the</em> thing that immediately sold me on Quest when I used the original unit back in 2019 and why I almost never use any other headset to play VR games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I fully recognize the advantages PCVR games could have. I just wish the tech would work for me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve written off PCVR more times than I can count, so why do I still seem to come back for more? The answer is that I fully recognize the serious advantages PCVR games could potentially have over Quest games.</p><p>Better graphics are just the start. Many SteamVR games are Steam Workshop enabled and can be easily modded. Half-Life: Alyx is a deal not just because of Valve&apos;s masterful storytelling but also because the modding community has produced some truly brilliant works of art with it.</p><p>But I rarely experience this because PCVR doesn&apos;t work for me on a technical level. No matter what I do, and no matter how hard I try, things never seem to get better. At the very least, even if I can get it working once, I seldom repeat the experience two days in a row. And, for that, I may very well be writing off PCVR forever.</p><p>Anyone want to buy a PC? I might be selling one.</p>

<ul><li>Google has enhanced security for Chrome's Safe Browsing feature, providing real-time protection against phishing for all users, regardless of their protection mode.</li><li>The security update is available for Chrome on desktop and iOS, with plans for an Android release later this month.</li><li>Additionally, Password Checkup on iOS has been upgraded to flag weak and reused passwords.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today that it has beefed up security for the <em>Standard</em> protection mode in Chrome&apos;s <em>Safe Browsing</em> feature. Now, everyone gets real-time protection against phishing and malware attacks.</p><p>Even with all the safety tools available to consumers, the internet isn&apos;t exactly becoming safer. To tackle this, Google upgraded Chrome&apos;s protection system, Safe Browsing, last year, adding real-time protection to the mix.</p><p>This feature, which was previously only available in Safe Browsing&apos;s <em>Enhanced Protection</em> mode, keeps an eye on the URLs you&apos;re browsing and instantly warns you if you wander into a sketchy part of the internet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.80%;"><img id="uxaXAG7iQsu5nAbKri69U6" name="google-chrome-phishing warning.jpg" alt="Google Chrome security feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxaXAG7iQsu5nAbKri69U6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="678" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is now up and running for anyone using Chrome on desktop or iOS. Google also plans to bring it to Android users later this month.</p><p>As you browse the web, Chrome will scan if the webpage you&apos;re on matches any malicious URLs in a local list. If it finds a match, it&apos;ll block the site and show a warning. However, Google found out that 60% of these sneaky domains are only active for less than ten minutes before they vanish.</p><p>This means that keeping an updated list of risky domains is less helpful. Since the list is stored locally, it can&apos;t shield you from new sites detected since the last update.</p><p>Google&apos;s fix involves live monitoring, where it constantly checks against Google&apos;s cloud database in real time to decide if a site is dangerous and needs to be blocked. According to Google, this method boosts protection from phishing and malware by 25%. Plus, it leans on AI to classify malicious URLs and web pages.</p><p>While live monitoring is now turned on by default in the Standard Protection mode, not everyone might be comfortable with Google scanning every URL you visit and every file you download.</p><p>To tackle privacy worries, Google is rolling out real-time protection in a way that preserves privacy through Fastly&apos;s Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) privacy server.

<p>Blink has debuted its latest Mini 2 plug-in camera, which is available today (Mar. 14) and starts at $39.99 in the U.S.</p><p>According to a press release, Blink states it has redesigned its next-generation Mini 2 security camera, beginning with its new custom chip. This chip is said to bring one of the Mini 2&apos;s key features: person detection. The camera features CV-enabled person detection through a Blink subscription, which should help trim down on false alarms if an animal walks by it.</p><p>The Blink Mini 2 has also been upgraded with improved image quality and low-light performance when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blink-mini-vs-blink-indoor">initial iteration</a>. The latest security camera offers a wider FoV (field of view) and a built-in LED spotlight that lets users peer through the camera in full color.</p><p>Privacy was another aspect Blink honed in on, stating its customers will have "complete control of their privacy settings." The company&apos;s official app will be users&apos; gateway to these settings as they customize activity zones and privacy parameters. </p><p>Regarding the former, Blink states users can set their Mini 2 to record areas they find important and do away with spots that don&apos;t matter, like public walkways.</p><p>The Mini 2 continues to feature a two-way speaker, much like the original Mini. Additionally, Blink states image processing captured by the camera takes place on your device.</p>

<p>Blink&apos;s Mini has always been compact, however, the company is refreshing it with a sleeker design for the sequel. The Mini 2 is stated to retain the same size (2" x 1.9" x 1.4") but has been outfitted with a weather-resistant power adapter for outdoor use.</p><p>The Mini 2 features some AI, as the press release adds that the camera works well with Amazon&apos;s Alexa. Using the "Alexa Blink Smarthome Skills," users can connect an Echo device to their Mini 2. Doing so will deliver important home security alerts, an option to check your camera&apos;s live feed, and arming and disarming commands.</p><p>Customers who&apos;ve purchased a Mini 2 will have access to its core features, but those looking to take it further will need a subscription. Grabbing a plan will provide homeowners with the Mini 2&apos;s person detection feature, cloud video recording, rapid video playback access, and 60 days of unlimited video history.</p><p>Blink states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/plan-management/purchasing-a-blink-subscription-plan-through-amazon">subscription plans</a> begin at $3 a month or $30 for a year.</p><p>Consumers can grab the Blink Mini 2 today (Mar. 14), starting at $39.99 in the U.S. for indoor use. Those interested in Canada will find it starting at CAD 54.99. If you&apos;re taking it outside and want the weather-resistant adapter, those prices will jump to $49.98 and CAD 69.98, respectively.</p>
