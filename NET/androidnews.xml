<ul><li>Pixel Camera app bearing 9.4.103.641377609.23 introduces new General and Pro tabs for older Pro models.</li><li>Pixel Fold, Pixel 7 Pro, and Pixel 6 Pro users can choose between Auto and Manual lens selection options, like the flagship Pixel 8 Pro handset.</li><li>The zoom buttons, like 1x and 2x, have been replaced by UW, W, and T with the new update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel Camera is getting a new update that brings in new settings and exclusive features from the Pixel 8 Pro to other Pixel phones.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/pixel-camera-9-4-update/">9to5Google</a>, the new changes with the latest Pixel camera app update bearing the <strong>9.4.103.641377609.23</strong> version start with the ability to choose a specific lens to capture a shot, as previously seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Older Pixel phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, Pixel 6 Pro, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> will now have the feature tucked under the “Lens Selection, “ which provides Auto or Manual options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="xbL2TBmUNqGTHBebMSARe9" name="google-pixel-camera-lens-selection.jpeg" alt="Pixel Camera Settings "New"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbL2TBmUNqGTHBebMSARe9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the Lens Selection is now buried under the Photo Settings section in the camera app, which is split into two tabs: General and Pro — a new addition as part of the latest update rollout.</p><p>The other interesting change is the replacement of the zoom buttons right above the shutter button. Instead of 1x or 2x buttons, Pixel users will now get to see UltraWide (UW), Wide (W), and Telephoto (T) options, making it easier for beginners to differentiate. The primary camera for the respective device will launch as default (W) whenever users open the camera app.</p>

<p>The RAW/ JPEG picker, previously hidden in the Advanced Settings section, has also been moved to the new Pro tab. However, like the Pixel 8 Pro, other Pixel owners won’t be able to select the Resolution for the image, notes 9to5. </p><p>Similarly, the “Store video efficiently” settings are also shifted to <strong>Settings> Video</strong> under Video Stabilization and Audio Zoom toggles. It was also earlier tucked away under Advanced Preference.</p><p>The publication further indicates that the HDR+ Improved Frame Selection feature is likely included in the new update for devices including Pixel 6 and above, alongside the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. </p><p>For the aforementioned device owners, the update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera">already live</a> on Google Play Store. On the other hand, Google has also rolled out new features in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-june-2024-feature-drop-detailed">Feature drop</a> for Pixel phones and Pixel Watch models.</p>

<p>Oura was founded in 2013, and for the past 10 years, we’ve seen the company aggressively pursue its competitors since it holds many patents in the smart ring industry. Right after the Galaxy Ring was announced, the company was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-responds-galaxy-ring-announcement">quick to remind</a> Android Central that it has “100 granted patents, 270 pending patent applications, and 130+ registered trademarks.”</p><p>Oura argues that some of its competitors have infringed on its patents, involving aspects of design, functionality, and more. In March, it filed an ITC lawsuit against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman</a>, RingConn, and Circular for patent infringement.</p><p>“Unfortunately, when we see companies take shortcuts that imitate and ride the coattails of our innovation, we have no choice but to take action,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-files-itc-action-for-patent-infringement/">said</a> Tom Hale, Oura’s now-CEO.</p><p>Hale goes on to say that, having spent over a decade investing in the research and development of the ring and engineering it into its hardware and software, Oura will continue to protect the efforts it took to reach where they are today.</p><p>Samsung, fully aware it might be next in line to get sued for its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-sues-oura-to-prevent-galaxy-ring-patent-challenge">filed a lawsuit against Oura Health Oy</a> at the San Francisco Division District Court on May 30. The lawsuit claims that Oura’s pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement could actually pose a risk to the success of Samsung’s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-MWC-silver-close.jpg" alt="Eyes on with the Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBUFKrUfBvXCDw7oCAbjcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, has no comment on the likelihood of Samsung winning the lawsuit. However, he points out that he doesn’t see it as an offensive move to stifle competition. “Rather, I see it as a defensive move to ensure a fair fight.”</p><p>And reasonably so, considering Oura’s history. “Samsung’s suit does help paint itself in a better light as it appears to evangelize competition, while Oura, the underdog in the overall wearables market, is perceived as a monopoly,” Ubrani added.</p><p>The question, though, is more about the validity of some of Oura’s patents. Samsung argues that Oura’s patents cover features common to most smart rings, such as sensors, batteries, and data scores. However, if the court agrees on these aspects, Oura’s legal strategy could be weakened.</p><p>Despite this, Samsung asserts that the Galaxy Ring “has not infringed, and does not infringe, directly or indirectly, any valid and enforceable claim” from Oura’s five most commonly cited patents in its previous lawsuits.</p><p>Oura, on the other hand, has not publicly commented on Samsung’s lawsuit as of yet. The company did not respond to Android Central’s request for comments, either, but we will update this article once we have more information. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-colors.jpg" alt="Four Oura Rings in different finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yp7TetoRuQK8dJCY5XRDbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="671" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura was founded by Petteri Lahtela, Kari Kivela, and Markku Kosekela. Their vision was to create a functional and minimalistic wellness device. According to Petteri Lahtel, the brand’s early days weren’t easy, as securing funding proved difficult. </p><p>“It was really hard to find investors who were also driven by something else other than money. Our mission from day one has been to create a lasting impact by empowering individuals to learn how their bodies respond to their lifestyles,” he said in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbforum.com/nbreport/petteri-lahtela-what-i-learned-through-founding-oura-health/">interview</a> with Nordic Business Report. </p><p>While they continued to struggle for funding, they launched a Kickstarter campaign and publicized their concept in 2015. The company has since created three generations of its smart ring, the latest of which is its most popular and has solidified Oura as a leader in the space. Throughout these years, the focus on data accuracy and user empowerment has powered the ring since 2021.</p><p>“That’s how we stand out against other wearables—Oura Ring is designed not just for a moment in time or a season, but it’s meant to be a personal health companion for life,” Jason Russell, Oura’s VP of consumer software product, told me in an email.</p><p>From creating rings that could only track sleep and fitness to getting breakthroughs in women’s reproductive health research, including the capability of Oura Ring to track menstrual cycles and identify pregnancy, it has come a long way.</p><p>When discussing new players entering the smart ring market, Russel said that Oura has always welcomed “increasing competition as validation for the category’s potential.” However, to the contrary, whenever a company tries to enter the smart ring market, Oura has sued it for patent infringement, likely protecting years of innovation and user-centric design. </p><p>“With over a decade of experience in the industry, we’ve established ourselves as pioneers in the ring form factor, setting a high standard for innovation and accuracy, and we continue to innovate,” he added. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Oura wins its lawsuits and competitors are forced to alter or retract their designs, consumers will have fewer options when choosing a smart ring. Oura would likely monopolize the smart ring market and restrict consumers&apos; ability to find a better ring that matches their budget and needs.  </p><p>"As a pioneer in the space, Oura has every right and reason to protect their moat, particularly as a giant like Samsung introduces a competing product," Ubrani added.</p><p>Secondly, going after competitors could only lead to a potential price rise, limiting accessibility to customers. It might even discourage other companies from investing in the innovation of these niche wearables, which could stifle the growth of smart ring tech. However, considering the legal system&apos;s complexity, it is important to note that these lawsuits might take years to resolve.</p><p>Oura might argue that these lawsuits help maintain the quality of products and prevent companies from infringing on their patents. </p><p>However, Ubrani says in reality, "these lawsuits and protectionist moves ultimately hurt the consumer because it reduces competition and instead, on some occasions." Instead, Oura should focus on improving its products and services to stand out in the market rather than chase after its competitors.</p>

<ul><li>The Realme GT 6 launch in Spain faces a major setback as the first shipment was stolen during transit.</li><li>The launch, originally set for June 20, is delayed due to the missing shipment.</li><li>Realme admitted it couldn't recover the stolen devices, highlighting supply chain vulnerabilities for high-value electronics.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A shipping mishap has hit the much-awaited Realme GT 6 launch in Spain. The first batch meant for local stores in the country has vanished during transit.</p><p>In a statement on its official X account, Realme Spain apologized for the incident. The company addressed the missing Realme GT 6 shipment and expressed regret for the unexpected incident (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/realme-gt-6-stolen/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p>

<p>Despite ongoing recovery efforts, the shipment&apos;s location is still unknown. Due to the theft, the launch of the mid-range smartphone in Spain has been delayed.</p><p>The Realme GT 6&apos;s launch in Spain was initially set for June 20 with a coordinated rollout in physical stores, but it has now hit a major snag. The theft of the first shipment has seriously disrupted the planned rollout in the country.</p><p>Realme Spain, citing uncontrollable external factors, admitted it couldn&apos;t recover the stolen devices. The incident highlights the vulnerabilities in global supply chains, especially for high-value electronics.</p><p>Ahead of its launch, the phone&apos;s key specs have surfaced, indicating that the Realme GT 6 packs a punch with a few solid features: a 6.78-inch 120Hz display that hits 6,000 nits of peak brightness, a massive 5,500mAh battery supporting 120W fast charging, and a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 processor</a>. Users can pick between 8GB or 12GB of RAM and storage options ranging from 128GB to 512GB.</p><p>We might also see a 50MP main camera with OIS and a Sony-LYT808 sensor, a 50MP telephoto shooter with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_gt6_price_memory_options_in_europe_leak_ahead_of_launch-news-63314.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>.</p><p>Besides the shipping issues, the GT 6 theft poses a reputational challenge for Realme. To overcome this setback, Realme will need to focus on securing future shipments and maintaining strong customer trust.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster posted an alleged rendering of Samsung's Galaxy Ring charging case on Weibo, showcasing its small, ring box-like design.</li><li>It seems consumers will need to place their Ring in the center of the device, around the raised portion, to begin charging.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring's FCC listing teased a charging "cradle," though it was only seen in a mockup from underneath.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s first smart ring continues to generate excitement, and the latest leak may have spilled its charging case.</p><p>Known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Oji4m2Qqm?pagetype=viewer">Ice Universe</a> posted a supposed rendering of the Ring&apos;s charging case on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/16/samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-leak/">9to5Google</a>). At first glance, the case looks similar to a ring box you&apos;d spring open when the time is right. RingConn also has a similar ring case for its smart ring.</p><p>Internally, it seems consumers will nestle their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> around the raised portion with the expected contact pins for charging purposes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:670px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.55%;"><img id="ugfBPmTe8MKemhiHzndASg" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-charging-case-supposed-rendering.jpg" alt="A supposed look at the Galaxy Ring's charging case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ugfBPmTe8MKemhiHzndASg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="670" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another, slightly larger circle surrounding the Galaxy Ring in the image which could be some form of charging indicator. Most cases like this, especially for earbuds, offer some type of indicator to let you know your device is charging appropriately.</p><p>Samsung might opt for an in-device indicator as you set the Ring around the raised portion before closing. Aside from the case&apos;s supposed design, we&apos;re still left wondering about more concrete information about its specifications.</p><p>At the end of May, the Galaxy Ring appeared for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">its FCC certification</a>, which revealed its specifications in terms of available sizes and battery capacities. However, that listing also gave a vague mockup drawing of the charging "cradle" from underneath. Available information in the listing stated that Samsung would label each "cradle" with the appropriate ring size a consumer purchased.</p><p>The mockup also detailed where a user would plug in the USB charging cable to top up its internal battery. The FCC showed that the Galaxy Ring will arrive in ring sizes ranging from five to 12.</p><p>In other news, the Galaxy Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">was rumored</a> to feature quite a healthy battery life of nearly 10 days. Samsung Electronics President Roh Tae-moon confirmed this fact during the Ring&apos;s showcase at MWC 2024. So, with that in mind, it remains to be seen if users can carry around this Galaxy Ring case or if it&apos;s something that remains static at home.</p>

<p>It&apos;s an exciting time for Motorola foldable enjoyers as the company confirms they&apos;re on the way—and quite soon, too.</p><p>Motorola posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MotorolaUS/status/1802702833768079662">a quick video</a> on X, confirming that its next wave of foldables will launch on June 25 in the U.S. Unfortunately, Moto doesn&apos;t give us a clear view of the design of its Razr devices in the short teaser. What&apos;s easily discernable is that one variant (at least) will feature orange and blue colorways.</p><p>It also seems as though a vegan leather backing is to be expected on the devices.</p><p>The teaser continues, briefly showing several more colorways for its 2024 Razr phones, such as pink and maybe a cafe-brown option.</p><p>The good news is that we&apos;re only a week (and a day) away from seeing the Razr and Razr Plus 2024 in totality.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Motorola put its higher-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a> on the shelves <em>before </em>the cheaper Motorola Razr 2023 hit the market later in the year. It&apos;s unclear if the company will follow the same trend again this year or if consumers can grab both devices simultaneously, as that would be a quick turnaround for the more affordable variant.</p><p>Regardless, there&apos;s been some rumors that suggest Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">might not increase</a> the prices of its Razr foldables. It was discovered through a European listing that the Razr Plus could see a €1200 price tag, which is similar to its predecessor. Moreover, the device could get a larger RAM/storage option for the same price, with rumors suggesting a 12GB+512GB configuration.</p><p>Other news suggests Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">is going all in</a> on the bigger cover screens by boosting its Plus variant to 4 inches and giving its base model a larger 3.6-inch cover. The latter is the same size as the cover display on the 2023 Razr Plus.</p><p>The Plus variant is expected to debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 165Hz refresh rate on its cover display, and a 6.9-inch OLED internal screen. The base Razr model could see MediaTek&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> series chip with a 4,200mAh battery.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-with-a-walmart-plus-membership-2">What comes with a Walmart Plus membership?</h2>
<p>In addition to exclusive deal access, Walmart Plus memberships come with loads of great incentives, including free shipping on all orders (no minimum), free delivery from your local Walmart store, and a free subscription to the streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a> (on the Essential Plan). </p><p>Drivers with a Walmart Plus membership will also enjoy free tire repair and discounts on gas at over 13,000 participating locations. Walmart Plus also tends to offer some limited-time benefits that come and go. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/plus"><strong>sign up today</strong></a> and you&apos;ll get five months of Apple Music or three months of YouTube Premium at no additional cost.  </p>
<h2 id="how-much-is-a-walmart-plus-membership-xa0-2">How much is a Walmart Plus membership? </h2>

<p>Anonymous asks:</p><p><em><strong>Does using a cell phone increase the chance of cancer? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh boy, it&apos;s that time again. This question comes up every once in a while after some paper or publication questions the link between phone use and cancer rates. I&apos;ve seen a recent one implying that a particular brand of phone is more dangerous because it emits radiation and ignores it. You should, too, because there are a few glaring errors, like incorrectly listing what doctors and governing bodies call a safe amount. But it is a valid question and worth discussing once one bogus claim is tossed aside.</p><p>Because I always front-load the basic answer, I&apos;ll defer to the FCC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns">which states</a>:</p><p>"<em>According to the FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO), among other organizations, to date, there is no consistent or credible scientific evidence of health problems caused by the exposure to radio frequency energy emitted by cell phones.</em>"</p>
<p>As usual, though, the simple answer doesn&apos;t say it all. Nobody is saying there is <em>no</em> definite link between using a phone and cancer because it&apos;s impossible to know. What people at the CDC or WHO <em>do</em> know is that studies show the number of people who develop an illness has no evidence that phone use caused it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Cell phones</a> communicate with other devices, like cell towers or Wi-Fi routers, using RF (Radio Frequency) waves. The frequency of these waves is about the same as over-the-air broadcast television or the low setting of a microwave oven. They&apos;re also non-ionizing, which is really important in this discussion.</p>
<p>Non-ionizing radiation is everywhere at a much greater frequency than your phone emits because visible light is everywhere. If you have enough light to see or there is enough light to feel the heat, you&apos;re awash in non-ionizing radiation.</p><p>This type of radiation does not emit enough energy to damage human DNA and cause cancer like higher-frequency UV rays or X-rays can. At an extreme level, RF waves can heat human tissue, but your phone is incapable of producing this much energy. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUKsEdBmrSg55YXgoRQ9pe" name="sunshine.JPG" alt="Sunshine at the Natural History Museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUKsEdBmrSg55YXgoRQ9pe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3264" height="1836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These are things science knows. Indisputable facts if you will. Using this knowledge we can say that using a phone is no more dangerous than being in the path of a television signal or being inside under a bright lamp. It&apos;s far less dangerous than being outside in the sun with no UV protection, which is a known cause of cancer.</p><p>The good news is that concern for our safety doesn&apos;t stop there. The amount of RF emission from a phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-is-fcc-certification-necessary">tested and regulated</a> before you can buy one.</p>
<p>Cell phone RF is measured as SAR, which stands for the Specific Absorption Rate, which is the amount of radiation absorbed by the body. Your phone gives off radiation that your body will absorb, and phone makers have to limit the amount to meet standards.</p><p>Different countries and governing bodies have different regulations, but in the U.S., the FCC lists the maximum limit of SAR as 1.6 watts per kilogram of body weight. A phone can&apos;t emit more than this amount under any conditions.</p>
<p>As the FCC notes, these tests can be misleading. A phone&apos;s listed SAR value is when the phone is operating for an extended period under its highest possible power. Your phone will never work this hard. A better, more accurate SAR value would be based on variables that can&apos;t be tested, so the FCC goes with the worst-case scenario.</p><p>For practical purposes, this means a phone with a lower listed maximum SAR rating could perform worse than one with a higher listing in your hand under certain conditions. Remember this when you look at lists saying which phones are "safest" based on SAR ratings.</p>
<p>This is what science knows and has tested, but there is still more work to be done. Cell phone usage is a relatively new phenomenon. We don&apos;t have hundreds of years of historical data to compare, so we need to keep looking. Currently, nobody can find an actual link between phone use and cancer—but that doesn&apos;t mean nobody ever will.</p><p>If you want to be safe, nobody will fault you. Use the speakerphone or text instead of making a call. In the meantime, know that almost everything you see linking illness and phone use doesn&apos;t jibe with what the experts and scientists who study it every day have to say on the matter.</p>

<ul><li>A new round of rumors spills an alleged look at Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra with its squarish body and circular watch face set on top of it.</li><li>The renders show the device in white and black colorways featuring a circular, third orange (potentially rotating) button on the side.</li><li>Renderings of the Watch Ultra have spilled before, showing a similar design and now rumors state the device's 47mm size could launch between $699 and $710.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another round of leaks is surfacing regarding Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watch Ultra&apos;s potential design and price tag.</p><p>The leaks stem from X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Tim_tom_0/status/1802152272123548140">Tim Tom</a>, who posted an alleged snapshot of the Galaxy Watch Ultra in white and black colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-price-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). From the renderings, it seems Samsung is moving toward a squarish body with a circular watch face atop that.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Watch Ultra white version pic.twitter.com/OSJbscGkIA<a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_tom_0/status/1802259273092665546">June 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The right side of the device seems to offer three buttons with the center-most one colored orange and metallic silver on its face. The purpose of these buttons is unclear. These could likely open the app&apos;s menu and other options like previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watches</a>.</p><p>This new centered orange button <em>could </em>rotate, letting users scroll through their app menu or adjust media volume. With such uncertainty, it&apos;ll be worth waiting until Samsung&apos;s full reveal of the watch.</p><p>The leaks continue with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-watch-ultra-us-prices-colours-revealed/">91Mobiles</a> reportedly obtaining information about Samsung&apos;s potential price plan for the Watch Ultra. The publication&apos;s unnamed source states the device could cost anywhere between $699 and $710. These prices refer to the watch&apos;s 47mm size variant.</p><p>Leaked renders from X double down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">on previous images</a>, showing the device with that squarish body and circular face. There was a third circular button present in those photos, too. However, it was colored like the rest of the watch&apos;s body. Those rumors also said the Watch Ultra could be slightly bigger than the Watch 6 Classic with the following dimensions: 47 x 47.14 x 16.4mm.</p><p>Elsewhere in the post, you can also see a render of the charging cradle for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, which also appeared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-charging-case-rendering-leak">separate leak</a>.</p><p>What&apos;s exciting is that Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">upcoming countdown animation</a> for this summer&apos;s Unpacked event appeared. From the snapshot, it seems the Korean OEM is preparing for its event on July 10 at 10 PM Korean Standard Time (KST).</p>

Qualcomm cleared up the speculation with a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-6s-gen-3-not-new-3451623/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which confirmed that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 isn’t <em>really</em> a new chip. </p><p>“Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is an enhanced version of Snapdragon 695 delivering improved CPU, GPU, and AI performances (sic),” the company said.</p><p>Before this was made clear, it already seemed like the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 was yet another rebranded version of the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3, which was first released in 2021. For starters, the beginning of the model number of the former (SM6375-AC) is identical to that of the latter (SM6375). Both chips also used the 6nm manufacturing node, which is an older process. We’ve already seen 3nm mobile chips come out, and the 6nm process is far from cutting edge in 2024. </p><p>With that being said, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 does have a few clear advantages over the Snapdragon 695. The ”enhanced” version of the chip has a higher CPU and GPU clock speed, potentially making for faster performance. Qualcomm also says that there is support for “AI performances,” but we really don’t know what that means. It’s unlikely that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 will be able to deliver the kinds of modern on-device AI features that we see on stronger platforms, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or the Tensor G3. </p><p>These minor improvements can’t change the fact that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is built on the exact same architecture as the Snapdragon 695, and there’s only so much Qualcomm can do to pull more performance out of it. This creates a situation where new devices with a “new” processor are potentially starting three years behind competing devices.  </p>

<p>It’s disappointing that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is nothing new, because we know Qualcomm can do better. This isn’t like the dark days at Intel, where the entire company was struggling to improve its chipmaking and fabrication technologies across its portfolio. Qualcomm is doing better than ever, and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Snapdragon X platforms are giving Apple a run for its money for the first time in a long while. </p><p>Qualcomm clearly focuses on the money-makers, and it’s not hard to see why. The company has had essentially a monopoly on the flagship Android mobile processor space for a while, even after Google moved to its own Tensor processors. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> doesn’t come close to matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip</a>, so any buyer worried about performance will choose a Qualcomm-powered phone. That’s without even getting into the grip Qualcomm has on wireless modems.</p><p>The company is breaking into the laptop and desktop markets with the Snapdragon X platform, which is powering a solid lineup of new Windows laptops set for release this week. Qualcomm is the <em>only</em> company making a chip that will be compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Microsoft’s Copilot+ feature set</a> at launch. It already announced plans to bring Snapdragon X to more form factors, starting with a Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC. </p><p>This is why it’s a shame that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is just a 2021 chip with a few tweaks. No one is expecting Qualcomm to make its budget chips competitive with flagship ones, but the company can certainly do more than rebadging three-year-old processors.</p>
<h2 id="qualcomm-would-be-making-a-mistake-by-becoming-complacent-2">Qualcomm would be making a mistake by becoming complacent</h2>

<p>When Intel got complacent, AMD was right there to swoop in and capture some market share. Now, the “team red” and “team blue” race is back on in full swing. The same thing could happen in the smartphone chipmaking industry if Qualcomm keeps re-releasing chips without any new innovation. Qualcomm isn’t the only company making mobile processors, and it’s facing real competition, especially in the low end of the market.</p><p>MediaTek has the potential to one-up Qualcomm in the budget market, especially if its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-benchmarks-vs-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">latest chips</a> indicate what it can do. The company has been teasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android device</a> powered by a MediaTek processor, which would be huge for the company. MediaTek seems to have the chops to compete with Qualcomm industry-wide, but it can definitely do so in the budget sector if Qualcomm keeps releasing ”new” chips like the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3.</p>

<hr>
<p>Recent new evidence indicated that Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy foldable launch is heading for an early July release this year. Several other Galaxy products are in the pipeline and are expected to launch alongside the foldable. Interestingly, most of them are now listed on Samsung&apos;s wearable app before launch.</p><p>Samsung has a Galaxy Wearable app showing all its compatible devices for Galaxy phones. An X user, Rydah, shared a leaked screenshot (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-buds-3-leak-3451132/">Android Authority</a>) of the app that shows all the latest and upcoming Galaxy devices. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung leaking their own products is priceless.

<p>The list comprises the recently released first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">budget smartwatch</a> from Samsung, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>. It is accompanied by the soon-to-be-launched Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro. Next to them is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>; interestingly, there is no rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra model. The most awaited fitness tracker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, is also present on the list.</p><p>The other devices in the list include the currently available ones like Galaxy Fit 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, amongst others. </p><p>The interesting thing about the list isn&apos;t the device models but rather the iconography accompanying them. They reveal the device&apos;s design, and the exciting new change appears to be that of the Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro; unlike the predecessors, which feature a rounded earbud design, the Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro come with a new stem design similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">Apple AirPods Pro</a>.</p>

<p>This new design has also been witnessed in a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">marketing image leak</a> of the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, which showcased the new stem; however, the image was pixelated. Samsung&apos;s choice of the new design aesthetic for these buds still needs to be determined. However, the change in design implies a better fit of the earbuds for users, better microphone quality with the stem design, ease of removal and placement in the charging case, and handier touch controls.</p><p>Nevertheless, these capabilities are still purely theoretical at this moment; more details are likely to be shared by Samsung at the Unpacked event, which is now tipped to be held on July 10, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">latest leak</a>.</p>
