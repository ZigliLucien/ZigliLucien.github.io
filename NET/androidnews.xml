<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Google has found that there were 97 zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in 2023, over 50% higher than the number from 2022 (62 vulnerabilities).</p><p>Google&apos;s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant teamed up to analyze the zero-day flaws revealed last year. Their analysis revealed that out of the 58 zero-days for which they could attribute the threat actor’s motivations, espionage was the main motive for 48 of those vulnerabilities.</p><p>Zero-days are essentially flaws that haven&apos;t been found by security experts yet. This means IT teams have zero time to fix them before hackers exploit them. That&apos;s why hackers love them, because using them doesn&apos;t set off any alarms.</p><p>Out of all the potential targets, criminals had their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/project-zero-exynos-modem-vulnerability">sights set on end-user platforms and products like smartphones</a>, operating systems, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-chrome-browser-sixth-zero-day-vulnerability-of-2023">web browsers</a>, and various applications. Google found that a total of 61 zero-days impacted these targets.</p><p>In 2023, Android saw nine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fixes-critical-android-zero-click-flaw">vulnerabilities being exploited</a>, up from just three in 2022. On the other hand, iOS faced nine zero-days out in the wild, compared to four in the previous year.</p><p>Additionally, there were eight zero-days hitting Chrome and 11 targeting Safari in the wild. Windows takes the lead among the top five, with 17 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited, up from 13 the previous year.</p><p>Looking at the findings by region, Google reports that 12 of the zero-days were exploited by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus following suit. In total, state-sponsored espionage made up 41.4% of the exploited zero-days in 2023.</p><p>"In 2023, we attributed to commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs) and government espionage actors a combined 48 of 58 zero-days for which we could attribute motivation and only 10 vulnerabilities to financially motivated actors," Google says. "The proportion (roughly 17%) in 2023 of financially motivated exploitation is slightly lower than our observations from 2022, and both of these years were down from the nearly one-third of vulnerabilities we attributed to financially motivated actors in 2021."</p><p>That said, investments in exploit mitigations across browsers and operating systems are making it harder for attackers to achieve their goals using certain types of vulnerabilities.</p><p>Google&apos;s researchers point out that companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, who are responsible for end-user platforms, have made significant investments. These investments are clearly affecting the types and quantity of zero-days that attackers can exploit.</p><p>Anyway, 2023 saw fewer disclosed zero-day flaws than 2021, which had 106 vulnerabilities. While this might sound like a good thing, researchers think that the rate of zero-day discovery and exploitation will probably stay high compared to the numbers before 2021.</p>

<hr>
<p>After Google revamped Gemini with a new mobile app, everyone started wondering where the artificial intelligence assistant would appear next. There have been past reports and inklings that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-gemini-app-will-come-to-headphones-that-support-google-assistant">Gemini will appear on Google Assistant earbuds</a>, tablets, or smart displays. However, new references to Gemini on tablets in the latest version of the Google Search app suggest a release could be near.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/26/gemini-tablet-launch-nears/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> found strings in version 15.12 of the Google Search app that directly outline how Gemini will work on tablets. "When Gemini is the digital assistant on this tablet, hosted by the Google app, it can access certain system permissions and data,"  a prompt explains, "like dialer, call and message logs, and contacts (to help you keep in touch), installed apps like Clock (to control alarms and timers), and screen content (to help you act on it)."</p><p>As is the case for Gemini on other platforms, there&apos;s a disclaimer that Gemini is still learning. Google also says that Google Assistant may be used in situations where Gemini isn&apos;t capable of helping and that some Assistant features won&apos;t be available. </p>

<p>9to5Google managed to get Gemini up and running on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> using the latest version of the Google Search app. Overall, the experience using Gemini on tablets is unexpectedly similar to using it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">big-screen foldables</a>, such as the Pixel Fold. Notably, Google Assistant remains the default voice assistant even when Gemini is installed on a Pixel Tablet. This falls in line with Google&apos;s earlier guidance that smart devices will still use Google Assistant. </p><p>"Gemini will not replace Google Assistant on your other devices, even if you opt-in to use it as your mobile assistant," Google explains in a support document. "On other non-mobile devices, including Smart Displays, smart speakers, TVs, cars, smart watches, headphones, and earbuds with Google Assistant built-in, and Pixel Tablets, Google Assistant will continue to respond to &apos;Hey Google.&apos;"</p><p>The Pixel Tablet is an interesting device because it is a standalone tablet and a smart home hub. Due to Gemini&apos;s current limitations with assistant-based features, it makes sense that Google isn&apos;t ready to completely swap out Assistant for Gemini on the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>While an official launch date is unknown, it looks like Google is gearing up for a Gemini launch on tablets. The Pixel Tablet will almost certainly be one of the first tablets to support Gemini, but it&apos;s possible third-party devices could be supported as well.  </p>

While this strategy made a lot of sense when it was introduced, data usage has changed considerably over the last two decades; these days, it&apos;s incredibly easy to put your data on a public cloud service and have it accessible from anywhere.</p>

<p>The downside to relying on public cloud providers is privacy — you don&apos;t have much say where your data is stored. So when I was strategizing on how to back up my data, I came up with a modified version of the 3-2-1 rule that made the most amount of sense for my particular use case. I&apos;ll start by saying that I have outsized storage requirements that are definitely not the norm — I currently use over 300TB of storage.</p><p>Out of that 300TB, just over 100TB is the actual data; it consists of all the photos and videos that my wife and I have taken over the past decade, a sizeable music library, and our media collection. The primary storehouse of the data is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+ with seven NAS HDDs</a>, totaling 128TB of storage. I then back up the NAS to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds3622xs-review">DiskStation DS3622xs+</a>, which has a dozen 12TB drives.</p><p>The third copy of this data is on an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-ds1019-plus-review">DiskStation DS1019+</a>; this was my primary home NAS until a few months ago, until I decided to switch to the DS1823xs+. As I was using brand-new HDDs in the DS1823xs+, I just left the DS1019+ and its data intact; I intend to move it to my parents house in a few weeks, and it will serve as the default offsite backup.</p><p>The missing piece of the puzzle is a cloud backup solution; I used Google Workspace until the end of last year to back up all the data from the DS1019+ to the cloud, which was encrypted with Hyper Backup. This was possible as Google didn&apos;t enforce any data limits with Workspace accounts — making the $20 monthly fee the best deal in the world of backups — but that isn&apos;t the case now.</p>

<p>I still use Google Photos to back up photos taken from phones, but other than that and storing documents in Drive, I don&apos;t have much need of cloud storage. Even if I decided to back up all that data, it would be absurdly costly to do so. </p><p>Utilities like Tailscale make it extremely easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/how-to-securely-access-your-synology-nas-from-anywhere">access a NAS from anywhere</a>, and with the sheer amount of data I have, it just doesn&apos;t make sense to back up to a cloud provider. Also, every time I consider storing data on a remote server, I&apos;m reminded of this quote from Dune: "The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it."</p><p>Technically, the 3-2-1 rule mentions you need to store data in two different media types, but that&apos;s unnecessary for my own needs, so I use mechanical hard drives throughout. Flash storage is still too costly, but I am considering picking up a quartet of 4TB WD Red NVMe drives and seeing how they hold up.</p><p>I know it&apos;s not feasible for everyone to store data in three different locations, but it makes sense to at least back up data to an external medium.

Most phones at this price tag look nearly identical on paper, and may even be made by companies you&apos;ve never heard of.</p><p>That&apos;s where the Moto G 5G 2024 comes in. Motorola is a household name with a great Android UI and a better update record than the company has ever had. This year&apos;s model has been upgraded with a vegan leather back, faster charging, faster 5G speeds, and NFC. Motorola certainly seems to be listening.</p><p>Some decisions are bizarre — a 2MP macro camera is useless and RAM boost does more harm than good — but the overall experience is one of the better ones you&apos;ll find at this price. The processor is fast enough to do most things, and while 4GB of RAM is anemic even with a 720p display, a little bit of patience will go a long way. If you&apos;ve only got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">$200 to spend on a new phone</a>, this is a good choice.</p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to believe, but design is the biggest differentiator between the Moto G 5G 2024 and basically every other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">Android phone under $200</a>. The back isn&apos;t some nasty, shiny plastic that&apos;s going to attract fingerprints and dust every time you take it out of your pocket. Instead, it&apos;s clad in a lovely vegan leather finish that looks as good as it feels.</p><p>Ironically, vegan leather is just another strange form of plastic that&apos;s built in a way to resemble actual animal leather without using animal products. It doesn&apos;t have <em>exactly</em> the same feel as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dbrand-leather-skin-review">DBrand leather phone skins</a>, but it feels substantially better than plastic or glass, in my opinion.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Vegan leather is so much better than plastic back.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That puts the Moto G 5G 2024 in a strange middle ground of design aesthetics and build that other $200 phones can&apos;t compete with. I love it, and it goes well with the new, stronger Gorilla Glass 3 on the front of the phone, which is more resistant to scratches and breaks than any previous generation of budget-minded Motorola phones.</p><p>The side rails of the phone are still slightly slippery plastic, but I don&apos;t expect metal or a finer finish at this price tag. At least the fingerprint scanner is included inside of the power button, a favorite design of mine that I&apos;d love to see extended to <strong>all</strong> Android phones, not just a select few models.</p><p>It&apos;s faster, more accurate, and more comfortable to use than the awkward in-screen fingerprint scanners found in more expensive phones.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Motorola listened to feedback and included important features like NFC in this year's model.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also well worth noting that Motorola listened to feedback and included NFC on the Moto G 5G 2024, an omission that bit Motorola with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2023-review#section-moto-g-5g-2023-price-availability">Moto G 5G 2023</a> and its other budget-priced 2023 phone models. This means you can make contactless payments with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Motorola launched the Moto G 5G 2024 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> aboard and guarantees the phone will get Android 15 along with three years of security updates. That&apos;s great since the performance of this phone is lacking and likely will feel painfully sluggish in four years when support ends.</p><p>I also love Motorola&apos;s gestures, such as double-chopping the phone to toggle the flashlight feature. These gestures have been on Motorola phones for a decade now and are still some of the best defining features of the Motorola experience.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pul3o6sWcp0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;d like to commend Motorola for including an LCD with no noticeable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> flicker. While phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Samsung Galaxy A15</a> offer better-looking AMOLED panels, Samsung&apos;s displays flicker like no other displays on the market. Most people aren&apos;t negatively affected by this, but if you&apos;re like me, just a few minutes of looking at a flickering display like that could give you hours of headaches or eye aches.</p><p>The Moto G 5G 2024&apos;s LCD has no perceivable PWM flicker, and my Opple Light Master IV tells me it has a frequency between 28,000Hz and 40,000Hz with extremely low modulation. This is the most friendly kind of display you&apos;ll find on any modern phone, full stop.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9tbAVUcAbLFw6jKvQxdSZZ" name="Moto-G-5G-2024-back-holding-01.jpg" alt="The back of the vegan leather Moto G 5G 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tbAVUcAbLFw6jKvQxdSZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First thing&apos;s first. If you end up buying a Moto G 5G 2024, turn off the RAM boost feature. Motorola included this to "virtually" expand the phone&apos;s RAM beyond the anemic 4GB included, but it ends up creating a worse overall experience. In my time with the phone, I found that RAM boost made switching between apps unreliable and, at worst, unstable.</p><p>Once I turned RAM boost off, the phone was notably more usable even if it&apos;s not the fastest device I&apos;ve ever used. You&apos;re not going to be playing Fortnite on the Moto G 5G 2024, but it&apos;ll do all your other daily tasks like web browsing, messaging, and phone calling just fine.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>RAM boost makes things worse, not better. Turn it off right away.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Beyond that, it&apos;s clear that Motorola had to skimp a bit on the camera quality to include a processor that could actually <em>do</em> something without needing the patience of a saint. Motorola <strong>highly</strong> oversells the camera in its marketing, saying you can "snap a flawless shot day or night" with the Moto G 5G 2024&apos;s main camera.</p><p>That&apos;s not true, although the camera isn&apos;t entirely useless, either. Every photo I took with the phone was quite soft, even during broad daylight.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t expect a $200 phone to take pictures I&apos;d be proud to print and hang on a wall, but this one doesn&apos;t quite live up to the hype Motorola tries to sell it with. The flower picture above is by far the best picture I took with the phone. Most others didn&apos;t even come close.</p><p>Additionally, the 2MP macro camera is <em>entirely</em> useless. I wish companies like Motorola would just get rid of these silly gimmicks and put the extra savings into a better main camera.</p><p>Likewise, the selfie camera is quite weak, delivering soft images at all times of the day or night. I thought this was just because the low-resolution 720P made captured images appear soft after taking them, but closer inspection on a monitor shows that this is just the way it is. It&apos;s fine, but don&apos;t expect much from this phone&apos;s camera.</p>

<p>I&apos;d pick this phone over Samsung&apos;s similarly-priced model for two main reasons: display, and performance. While AMOLED "looks" better, it flickers and hurts my head.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s choice of a lower-performance processor also means day-to-day use is pretty miserable on the Galaxy A15, while the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in the Moto G 5G 2024 is a far more usable choice. Aside from that, Motorola&apos;s phone build is superior, even if it&apos;s not getting as many software updates.</p><p>If you can wait to buy a phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30</a> often goes on sale for $229 and is well worth the extra $30 over the Moto G 5G 2024. It&apos;s got a <em>much</em> faster processor, better cameras, and faster charging. I hate the shiny plastic back, but at least the screen is also PWM-free and is easy to look at.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a good phone for $200.</li><li>You like Motorola gestures and MyUX features.</li><li>You're tired of phones with nasty slippery plastic backs.</li><li>You need a display that's PWM-free.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need great camera quality.</li><li>You like graphics-intense mobile games.</li><li>You need a waterproof phone.</li></ul>
<p>Building a quality phone for $200 is difficult, as companies have to balance components that don&apos;t cost much but still offer a "good enough" experience to feel worth the purchase. For the most part, the Moto G 5G 2024 fits the bill but it has a few shortcomings to be aware of.</p><p>Performance requires some patience, but it&apos;s nowhere near the disastrous level that we saw from budget Moto phones in 2022. Unfortunately, the faster performance meant Motorola had to make concessions on the camera quality. It&apos;s not awful, but it&apos;s (ironically) not as good as we saw from Moto in 2022.</p><p>Thankfully, though, daily use is just fine so long as you turn off the silly RAM boost feature. The inclusion of NFC means this can be used for mobile payments and other important modern features, plus a 3.5mm headset jack, all-day battery life, and fast 18W charging means you won&apos;t get annoyed by the little things that some other phones skimp on. All in all, it&apos;s a solid $200 buy if that&apos;s the top of your budget for a new phone.</p>

The brand likes to roll out preview builds as soon as possible to give developers a chance to test out the new features well in advance, and these releases also serve as a way to deliver feedback to the brand over the latest additions heading to Android.</p><p>Google introduced the first preview build of Android 15 at the end of February, and followed it up with DP2 on March 21. These builds are targeted at devs, and aren&apos;t meant for public use — those will come a bit later. The preview builds give us an early look into the features Google is building into Android, and while there wasn&apos;t a lot of excitement around Android 14, there&apos;s plenty of new stuff in Android 15.</p><p>I installed Android 15 Developer Preview 2 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> as soon as it became available, and I&apos;ve been testing it a few days now. Before we get to the new features, a word of caution: the build is very unstable, and it isn&apos;t remotely close to being ready as a daily driver. While the Play Store doesn&apos;t crash on launch — which was the case in Developer Preview 1 — there are plenty of issues with the build. With that out of the day, here&apos;s what&apos;s new in Android 15.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-release-timeline"><span>Android 15 release timeline</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog" name="android-15-schedule.jpg" alt="Android 15 release schedule" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gor37rkx9LtEEZRJASiyog.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a clearly defined timeline with its Android releases, and that&apos;s no different with Android 15. The preview builds will run until March, and we&apos;ll get a public beta build of Android 15 sometime in April, with Google planning four beta builds at this moment, running through July.</p><p>The stable build follows soon after, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> debuted in the month of August, Android 14 was delayed until October last year. That said, it is likely that Google will go back to its usual cadence this year, so a stable build should be available in August — I&apos;ll have more to share as we get more details.</p><p>While Google doesn&apos;t use codenames in public-facing documentation, all Android releases still have internal dessert codenames, and Android 15 is designated Vanilla Ice Cream. Like previous years, the Android beta program is limited to the Pixels, and this time, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5-review">Pixel 5</a> series isn&apos;t eligible — only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and upwards will pick up the update. Here&apos;s the list of devices:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li></ul>
<p>Android beta builds usually make their way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> by other brands as well, but this doesn&apos;t kick off until much later in the year. I&apos;ll share additional details as and when they&apos;re available.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-notification-cooldown-turns-down-the-noise"><span>Notification cooldown turns down the noise</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg" name="android-15-notifications.jpg" alt="Android 15 notification cooldown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiuynbZRkJSBsn6cyAv9zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notification cooldown is a great new feature that lowers the volume of incoming notifications when you get successive notifications from the same app. So if you&apos;re in a group chat and start getting constant notifications, Android 15 automatically lowers the volume of subsequent notifications. What&apos;s great is that you can select this setting for just conversations, or all apps. As someone who doesn&apos;t like getting many notification alerts (I use DND most of the day), this is a great new addition, and one that I will use to good effect.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-keyboard-vibration-gets-its-own-toggle"><span>Keyboard vibration gets its own toggle</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof" name="android-15-keyboard.jpg" alt="Android 15 keyboard vibration toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYViU9VahDfiu4YX38UNof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android 15 is adding a system-wide toggle to enable or disable keyboard vibration. You could do this previously by going into a keyboard&apos;s settings and toggle the feature individually, but the option to do so at a system-wide level that works across keyboards is a good addition. Google is also integrating a slider that lets you adjust the intensity of haptic feedback, similar to what OPPO and other brands already do.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-brightness-slider-vibrates-now"><span>The brightness slider vibrates now</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff" name="android-15-brightness.jpg" alt="Android 15 brightness slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzD3qv9czFhiUjhPJyYnff.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a bid to bring better feedback across the system, Google is adding haptic feedback to the brightness slider in Android 15. The effect is very subtle — it&apos;s not on the same level as the nav gesture intensity, but it is still great that you get some amount of feedback when adjusting the brightness.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-partial-screen-recording-lets-you-share-only-what-s-needed"><span>Partial screen recording lets you share only what's needed</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9AqLjyR8TTy32ofebF9P9h" name="android-15-record.jpg" alt="Android 15 screen record" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9AqLjyR8TTy32ofebF9P9h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google took its sweet time integrating a screen recorder into Android, and by the time it added it, all other brands had their own take on the feature, which was usually better. Anyway, Android 15 is getting an update that lets you take partial screen recording. Instead of recording the entire screen by default, you can now select to record an individual app, and it won&apos;t show the rest of the screen and notifications.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bluetooth-tile-is-actually-useful"><span>Bluetooth tile is actually useful</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qQ3JfHpNrxcsMWgr33tNQf" name="android-15-bluetooth.jpg" alt="Android 15 Bluetooth tile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQ3JfHpNrxcsMWgr33tNQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google moved the Wi-Fi and cellular connection tiles to a single tile called Internet, and it is a constant source of frustration as it adds another step if I just want to toggle my home internet on or off. By contrast, the Bluetooth tile — which could have actually benefitted with this functionality — was a standard toggle that turned the Bluetooth radio or on off.</p><p>Thankfully, Google is addressing this issue in Android 15, and a short press on the Bluetooth tile now pulls up a dialog box similar to the Internet one — you get to see your paired devices, and you have the ability to easily switch between devices, and there&apos;s the option to toggle Bluetooth connectivity. If you want to pair a new device, hitting the + icon at the bottom of the dialog box to pull up the Bluetooth settings page and connect a new device.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s One UI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> already use this system, and it&apos;s good to see Google baking it into Android.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H" name="oneplus-open-25.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otdGLT6rYiTxVh5oAktd2H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is lifting a feature that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> that switches whatever action you&apos;re doing on the inner screen to the cover screen when you fold a device. This is a very useful feature, and other foldables like the Honor Magic V2 also have it. With it being integrated into Android 15, we should see it heading to even more foldables in the future.</p>

<p>Google is making it easier for game and app makers to directly access the hardware, and the Android Dynamic Performance Framework consists of a set of APIs that allow better optimization, and in Android 15, Google is introducing a power-efficiency mode that&apos;s designed for "long-running background workloads." This is to ensure any background apps don&apos;t utilize more system resources than necessary.</p><p>In a similar vein, Google is rolling out new thermal thresholds that should make a difference with throttling. Even the latest phones with powerful hardware struggle with throttling issues in demanding titles, and I&apos;m excited to see if this change makes a difference in real-world use.</p>

<p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-your-android-phone-webcam-your-pc">use your phone as a webcam</a>, and with Android 15, Google is rolling out an HQ mode that makes a difference to video quality. There&apos;s now a toggle that lets you enable HQ mode, and it offers better detail resolution. The only issue is that your device will get noticeably warm, but it is a nice addition nevertheless</p>

<p>Android 15 DP2 brings a new feature to the Pixel Fold and Android tablets that enables a persistent taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Other brands offer this feature as standard on their foldables, so it is good to see Google adding it natively in Android 15. </p>

<p>Another new feature in Android 15 DP2 is the ability to pay the same audio across multiple headphones — no need to share earbuds. The Audio sharing sub-menu is located within the Connected devices page, and it lets you cast music to more than one Bluetooth device at a time. I wasn&apos;t able to get this feature to work just yet, but it should be usable in later builds. </p>

<p>The best part of Android is its sheer diversity; different brands have their own take on what Android should look like, and they roll out custom features that go above and beyond what Google offers on the Pixels. As I get to use all the flavors of Android, these are the features I want to see in Android 15 — that said, it&apos;s unlikely Google will include any of these in upcoming builds.</p>
<h2 id="floating-windows-2">Floating windows</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8" name="android-15-list-6.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK9cZrrNyLyNAnDaRtoBe8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ColorOS and MIUI rolled out floating windows three years ago, and it is a useful utility that lets you maximize screen real estate. Floating windows essentially lets you resize any app so that it fits on the display without taking up its entire width, and it can be overlaid onto another app, making it quite convenient to use. My best use case is launching the calculator in a floating window whenever I need to add up a few things, and it works exceedingly well in this situation.</p><p>If Google is looking to add floating windows to Android 15, it should consider looking at ColorOS&apos; implementation and not MIUI. In all its wisdom, Xiaomi thought it best to have floating windows enabled as default, with no way to turn off the feature. This means that whenever you pull down on a notification, it opens in a floating window, and I&apos;ve had several instances over the years where I inadvertently launched floating windows without meaning to.</p>
<h2 id="better-icon-customization-2">Better icon customization</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7" name="android-15-list-2.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tkpuueaEzKaJHRbs8HtCp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google introduced themed icons in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> (albeit in beta), and two years after launch, the feature is still half-baked at best. The problem isn&apos;t down to Google, but devs — as this feature isn&apos;t mandated, most app makers still choose to ignore it, and it makes the home screen look less cohesive. Even well-known services like Evernote don&apos;t offer the feature, and while that&apos;s more to do with the state of Evernote, it&apos;s annoying to not have all icons utilize the feature.</p><p>While Google&apos;s at it, if it can roll out the ability to change icon shape and size, that would be fantastic. I&apos;m still annoyed at how little customization is available on a Pixel phone in this particular regard, and really needs to do better.</p>
<h2 id="screen-distance-2">Screen Distance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7" name="android-15-list-3.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S5AwoYS6gMPUzzuiquYjy7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Screen Distance is a clever new feature in iOS 17 that utilizes the front camera to determine if you&apos;re holding your phone too close to your eyes. The goal here is to reduce eye strain, and if the camera detects that you&apos;re using your device closer than 12 inches from your face, it triggers a full-screen alert asking you to move your phone or tablet further away.</p><p>This feature proved to be quite useful on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I found that I had a tendency to hold the phone a little closer at night. Screen Distance is designed to reduce risk of myopia in children, but if you tend to use your phone in bed a lot, it can be quite a handy tool. Google needs to bring a similar utility to Android, and given that it uses the camera to gauge distance, it shouldn&apos;t be hard to implement.</p>
<h2 id="better-always-on-display-2">Better Always On Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8" name="android-15-list-4.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaCWQ5vnHxH9LsGU9iJTD8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s take on an Always On Display has always been lackluster, and Android 14 doesn&apos;t do much to change that. You only get the option to show time and date when choosing an always-on screen, and while you get notification icons at the bottom, there isn&apos;t any customization possible.</p><p>Other interfaces, meanwhile, offer extensive customizability in this area. I like the range of styles available in ColorOS and the fact that I can design my own pattern that shows up on the lock screen, and while One UI doesn&apos;t offer much out of the box, you can always install Good Lock and unlock a slate of customization options.</p>
<h2 id="app-cloning-2">App cloning</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8" name="android-15-list-5.jpg" alt="Android 15 wishlist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cGejBsBers5RfFCh9TKS8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android brands give you the option to clone an app so you can run two instances of it. This is handy if you&apos;ve got two SIM cards and want to fully utilize messaging services like WhatsApp or Telegram, but you don&apos;t have the ability to do so on a Pixel phone. As it usually does, Google teased this feature in earlier Android 14 beta builds, but it was nowhere to be found in subsequent betas, and is missing on the stable version.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-15-much-more-to-come"><span>Android 15: Much more to come</span></h2>

<p>We&apos;re just getting started with Android 15, and the public-facing beta builds are still a month away. That&apos;s when we usually see the big interface changes, and by that time, the builds are usually stable enough to be used on a daily basis. I&apos;ll regularly update this post as new builds show up, but even the little we&apos;ve seen of Android 15 suggests it will be an exciting release.  </p>

Although the chip vendor doesn&apos;t usually detail its launch plans, we got confirmation of the name as well as the release date. Qualcomm is set to showcase the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 at its annual summit in Hawaii in the month of October.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to be excited about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4; it is set to feature custom cores that should deliver better performance than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, along with decent gains in other areas. While the launch is still some way away, a slate of leaks give us a good indication as to what the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will have to offer, so let&apos;s dive in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs"><span>Snapdragon 8 Gen 4: Specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EvZeHcHxQnKuWQh6ZVRmPV" name="8-gen-3.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvZeHcHxQnKuWQh6ZVRmPV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm is known to switch up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will see the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. That&apos;s down to the introduction of Oryon cores that will be used in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4; the key talking point is that these Oryon cores utilize a fully custom design.</p><p>Qualcomm used a semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, and retain Kryo branding. However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility.</p><p>This is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p>
<p>While details are light at the moment, a leak out of China suggests these custom cores could go up to 4.3GHz, a sizeable increase over the 3.39GHz that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> goes up to. This obviously leads to a higher power draw, and it will be interesting to see how Qualcomm manages thermals.</p><p>Anyway, the return to custom cores should give the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon. Although we don&apos;t have many details on the Adreno front, the node shift to 3nm should give Qualcomm more breathing room to increase shaders.</p>

<p>Qualcomm isn&apos;t deviating from its usual launch schedule, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is set to debut in Hawaii in October. We don&apos;t know the launch date just yet, but if history is any indication, it will be the last week of the month. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> feature Qualcomm&apos;s designs, and with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 launching at the end of October, we should start seeing the first set of devices coming at the end of the year.</p><p>Xiaomi is a launch partner for Qualcomm, and it isn&apos;t unlikely to see the Xiaomi 15 being one of the first phones to feature the upcoming silicon. OnePlus also followed a similar strategy with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, where it launched the device in its home market ahead of global availability, and it&apos;s a good bet that the Chinese manufacturer will seek to do the same this time as well.</p><p>Ideally, it will be early 2025 before we can go hands-on with Snapdragon 8 Gen 4-powered devices. Considering just how good the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 has been, I&apos;m excited in seeing what Qualcomm offers with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and how those custom cores make a difference.</p>

The A-series started out by bringing features previously limited to Samsung flagships at a much more affordable price point. While it was traditionally focused on the mid-range segment, Samsung merged the entry-level Galaxy J series in 2019 into the Galaxy A lineup.</p><p>The result is that the Galaxy A series now starts under $159, thanks to devices like the Galaxy A03s. While the budget Galaxy A options make it easier to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, the mid-range options like the Galaxy A54 and the A55 offer exciting new features for those who want the latest screen tech and 5G connectivity.</p><p>Samsung clearly did the right thing by broadening focus with its Galaxy A devices, and they now account for nearly 60% of all Samsung phones sales globally. Considering the number of phones available in this series, it can get a bit daunting to find the device that&apos;s ideal for your needs. So if you&apos;re looking to upgrade to a new phone in 2024, these are the best Galaxy A series phones you&apos;ll need to consider.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.97%;"><img id="kApMyUagbA3AfFaQLb39W7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A35-and-A55-renders-all-colors.jpg" alt="Galaxy A35 and A55 renders showing the front and back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kApMyUagbA3AfFaQLb39W7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2402" height="1945" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy A55 is the latest in the A series, and while it doesn&apos;t differ too much from its predecessor, there are a few new features that are noteworthy. The overall design is largely unchanged, and this is true of any Samsung phone in 2024 — even the Galaxy S24 Ultra is virtually indistinguishable to its predecessor.</p><p>That said, the Galaxy A55 has a marginally larger 6.6-inch screen, and that makes it a smidgen taller and wider than the Galaxy A54. The AMOLED panel itself is the same, and you get the same brightness levels as last year, 120Hz refresh, and FHD+ resolution, but it now has a coating of Gorilla Glass Victus+.</p><p>You get the same set of cameras as last year, and that includes a 50MP main lens, 12MP wide-angle, and a 5MP macro that just doesn&apos;t measure up. The battery is unchanged at 5000mAh, and the Exynos 1480 is nearly identical to the Exynos 1380 that was used in the Galaxy A54, albeit with a slightly higher frequency.</p><p>Although Samsung now guarantees seven software updates to its Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy A55 gets the same four platform update cycle as its predecessor. Given the sheer number of similarities to last year, it&apos;s understandable that Samsung isn&apos;t launching the Galaxy A55 in the U.S. at all — the brand is directing customers to pick up the Galaxy S24 or S23 FE instead.</p><p>Previous devices in the A5x series sold incredibly well Stateside, and while there isn&apos;t much in the way of new hardware, it&apos;s still bizarre that Samsung isn&apos;t bringing one of its best phones of 2024 to the country.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review">Galaxy A54</a> is over a year old at this point, but it is still the default choice if you want a mid-range Samsung phone in 2024. As I said above, the Galaxy A55 doesn&apos;t really bring anything new to the table, and as the A54 has been on shelves for a while now, there are attractive discounts to be had on the device.</p><p>There isn&apos;t one area where the A54 truly shines, but the combination of a vibrant AMOLED panel, 50MP camera at the back, decent battery, and four Android OS updates make it a good choice. That said, the phone isn&apos;t particularly fast, and isn&apos;t designed for gaming — it still uses Arm&apos;s old v8 cores and doesn&apos;t pass muster when playing demanding titles.</p><p>While you won&apos;t see many slowdowns in daily use, the Galaxy A54 is by no means a powerful phone. But if you don&apos;t intend to play games and want a device that can tackle browsing and social media use, there&apos;s not much to fault with the device. </p><p>If you can get a good deal, the Galaxy A54 is a terrific choice in 2024. </p>

<p>The Galaxy A35 takes the best features of the Galaxy A54 and brings it to an affordable package. It uses the same Exynos 1380 platform, and while it may not be as fast as what you get on the likes of the Pixel 7a, it is better than the Dimensity 100 that was featured on the Galaxy A34 last year.</p><p>You also get a glass back this time around, and it makes the A35 look just that little bit more premium. Samsung didn&apos;t make any changes to the sides, and those are made out of polycarbonate, like last year. The front gets Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection, making it more resilient to tumbles. </p><p>Samsung also offers IP67 ingress protection as standard on its mid-range phones, and that&apos;s the case with the A35. The 50MP camera takes better photos than previous generations, the 6.6-inch 120Hz AMOLED panel gets bright in daily use, and the 5000mAh battery is designed to last a day and a half between charges.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy A55, the A35 is available in the U.S., and considering just how similar it is to last year&apos;s Galaxy A54, it may be a better choice if you want a new phone this year.</p>

<p>The Galaxy A25 sits one tier below the Galaxy A35, and it is available for $299. You can get it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced-Expandable/dp/B0CN1Q2X3B">as low as $264 on Amazon</a>, and that is a good value when you consider what you&apos;re getting with the device. As is the case with other Galaxy A models, Samsung didn&apos;t make any changes to the design, and as such the A25 still uses the older waterdrop-style cutout for the camera at the front.</p><p>It has the same 6.5-inch AMOLED screen as last year, but this time, the refresh rate goes up to 120Hz (from 90Hz). You still don&apos;t get ingress protection on the A25; if you need the feature, you&apos;ll need to pick up the A35 instead. The 50MP camera at the back is decent enough in its own right, but it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to what you get on the mid-range Galaxy A devices.</p><p>That said, there&apos;s still an SD card slot, the same 5000mAh battery that you see across the Galaxy A range, and similar software features. At the end of the day, it&apos;s this familiarity that makes the A25 a good overall choice.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A15</a> lowers the barrier to entry for 5G quite considerably; the phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Expandable-Security/dp/B0CN1QSH8Q">available for just $199 on Amazon</a>, and you get a lot for that price. There&apos;s an AMOLED panel with good color vibrancy, and it goes up to 90Hz. The 50MP camera at the back takes decent shots in daylight scenarios, and while it struggles in challenging situations, it is much better than its predecessor.</p><p>The 5000mAh battery lasts two days between charges, and you get One UI 6 based on Android 14 out of the box. Obviously, there are downsides; the Dimensity 6100+ isn&apos;t fast enough, and you&apos;ll see slowdowns and lag in routine everyday tasks. The base model has just 4GB of RAM, and that just isn&apos;t enough — you&apos;ll ideally need to get the 6GB model.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any ingress protection, and the design isn&apos;t quite as modern as the Galaxy A55. But there&apos;s an SD card slot as well as a 3.5mm jack here, and while it won&apos;t win any awards, the Galaxy A15 does a good job delivering the basics.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung will begin rolling out its major One UI 6.1 update starting Thursday (Mar. 28), which brings its AI software to U.S.-based users.</p><p>According to a press release, owners of Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices should begin preparing to download and install the coming update. The Korean OEM states the update is on tap for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a>, Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Flip 5</a>, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series. The update brings these past-gen devices closer to the experience of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>One UI 6.1 features the company&apos;s Galaxy AI software throughout, delivering several on-device features. Kickstarting the update is Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>." Users can run a search based on anything on their Android device without switching to Chrome or another Google-created app.</p><p>Users of past-gen devices can now circle, scribble, highlight, or tap items in images to find more information through Google Search. Moreover, you can write your own query to help guide the search.</p><p>Live Translate is another feature One UI 6.1 brings, enabling users to experience real-time translations during phone calls.</p><p>Chat Assist and Samsung&apos;s Generative Edit arrive to bring some utility to what its Galaxy device owners can utilize. The former, available through the Samsung Keyboard, can help users adjust their "message tone" and translate messages in 13 languages. Generative Edit&apos;s arrival is said to help users "customize their photos" with resizing, removal, and other AI tools for image enhancements.</p><p>Galaxy AI through One UI 6.1 will start rolling out on March 28 on the previously mentioned past-gen devices. Samsung states the update will roll out on devices sold through various carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and USCC.</p><p>Additionally, devices purchased through Amazon, Best Buy, and more will also receive the update.</p><p>Samsung reiterates in its press release that certain Galaxy AI features, like Circle to Search, require an internet connection. The company also informs users that its Galaxy AI features are free, but the company will look to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-plans-to-charge-for-certain-galaxy-ai-features-after-two-years">start charging for them</a> in 2026.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung announces the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model globally.</li><li>While it looks much like the predecessor model, it packs a new chipset underneath.</li><li>The chipset is believed to be the same Exynos 1280 that powered the Galaxy A53 5G.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Putting an end to multiple leaks and rumors, Samsung finally introduced the third interaction of its Galaxy Tab S6 Lite.</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-style-and-function-in-a-compact-package">announcement post</a>, Samsung shared the details of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model, which comes as the successor to the model released in 2022 with the same moniker. Samsung says that the new tablet is “a stylish offering designed for both work and play. “</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.36%;"><img id="Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-render-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1146" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the design front, the new tablet doesn’t have significant changes compared to the predecessor model. It still packs in the same 10.4-inch screen on the front with 2000 x 1200 resolution, and the device, on the whole, measures 7mm in thickness. </p><p>The tablet comes in Wi-Fi and LTE models, weighing around 465 grams and 467 grams, respectively. The color options include Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and Mint, the new color that the company is offering for the first time.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is powered by an octa-core CPU with clock speeds at 2.4GHz. While Samsung doesn’t mention the chipset in the announcement, it is believed that the Exynos 1280 powered Samsung phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a>. The storage options include 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of onboard storage with additional microSD support for up to 1TB.</p><p>Keeping the lights on the tablet is a massive 7040mAh battery capacity, which promises at least 14 hours of non-stop video playback. </p>

<p>Samsung is emphasizing the S-Pen support on the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024), as it claims to lift the productivity aspect with the help of Samsung Notes on the large screen tablet as users would be able to take notes even without unlocking the device, which is familiar on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and other preceding Ultra models that come with built S-Pen.</p><p>While the tablet doesn’t feature a built-in S-Pen, it comes bundled and sticks to the device, and no separate charging is necessary. Samsung notes that users can take advantage of the large screen for efficient multitasking.</p><p>Other notable highlights of the device include dual speakers powered by AKG, Dolby Atmos, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, a single 8MP primary rear camera, and a 5MP selfie shooter.</p><p>While Samsung is assigning the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tabletshttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range Android tablet</a> for young professionals, students, and families alike, its pricing and availability in the regions have yet to be determined. </p><p>Users have to bear in mind that the storage options alongside the color options may change based on their regions when the tablet becomes widely available, which could begin on March 28, 2024.</p>

<p>Google is beginning to roll out a new update to Chat today (Mar. 26) that brings a long-awaited messaging feature to the platform.</p><p>Google Chat now supports voice messages on its platform, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/03/send-voice-messages-in-google-chat.html">Workspace update</a>. The company states that the feature will only be available on mobile devices with this rollout as it continues to develop a version for desktops. Google states that voice messages in Chat should help users "convey more information" and deliver more emphasis.</p><p>Users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android</a> and iOS can tap the microphone icon beside the image option in a one-on-one or group chat. Chat will begin recording audio; when you&apos;re done, you&apos;ll have the chance to listen to it and re-record if there are mistakes. After that, users can send their recordings.</p><p>Those you&apos;re chatting with can quote, react, and reply to it within a thread. Google teased that it&apos;s also working on adding voice message transcriptions, which should arrive "in the coming months."</p><p>Unfortunately, Google has left personal account holders out of its rollout of voice messages in Chat. The company states Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Essentials Plus, Enterprise Standard, and Enterprise Plus users are eligible to receive it.</p><p>Users on Google&apos;s rapid release schedule will see voice messages arrive today (Mar. 26). They should give the process at least 15 days to complete. Google will shift to the "Scheduled Release" domains on April 15.</p><p>Admins of the previously mentioned domains will find that voice messages are turned on by default.</p>

<p>Google has been working on voice messages in Chat for a while now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-spotted">an interview</a> with the company also stated that its customers had requested the feature quite often. Google stated that a feature like this would help further evolve Chat from a simple text-based app to one that supports multimedia modalities.</p><p>Chat also picked up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-for-android-gets-starred-messages-feature">an update in February</a> that brought it closer to Messages as users can now "Star" messages. Starring messages in Chat enables folks to rediscover them through search and spot what&apos;s important easily using its bright star icon. Searching for saved or "starred" messages joins users&apos; ability to discover mentions in the app.</p>
