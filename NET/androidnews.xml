With the year 2024 coming to a close, major launches such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 series</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Pixel 9 lineup</a> have given customers a lot of feature-packed smartphones to choose from. So, if you have picked up a model from the Galaxy S24 trio, the (relatively) affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review" target="_blank">Pixel 8a</a>, the fantastic all-rounder <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a>, or any of the other newer launches, here&apos;s all you need to know about moving over the data on your old phone to your new one. </p><p>Thankfully, Google makes it extremely convenient to migrate all your texts, call logs, contacts, music, and photos over to your new phone seamlessly, so let&apos;s get started. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-back-up-data-on-your-old-android-phone"><span>How to back up data on your old Android phone</span></h3>
<p>You&apos;ll need to make sure that all the relevant data on your old phone is backed up to the cloud before you make the switch over to your new phone. Google automatically backs up contacts, call logs, texts, and settings—including Do Not Disturb details—to Google Drive, so you&apos;ll be able to restore all that information to your new device just by logging in with your Google account during the initial configuration.</p>
<p>Best of all, the data that Google automatically backs up doesn&apos;t count toward your 15GB free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> storage quota, so you don&apos;t have to worry about running out of storage. This feature backs up your call history, app data, contacts, device and home screen settings, and text messages. So, before you move over to a new phone, it makes sense to see if this data is already on the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We&apos;re using a Pixel phone for reference, but the steps outlined below should be the same for most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> running Android 7.0 Nougat and above. Of course, you can always search for <strong>&apos;backup&apos;</strong> in your phone&apos;s settings to find the option.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong> from the Quick Settings or your apps.</p><p>2. <strong>Scroll down</strong> to the bottom of the page.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>System</strong> menu item. If this option is not available, you can tap the <strong>Google</strong> menu item and use the <strong>Manage backup</strong> option to get to the backup settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3220px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.53%;"><img id="Qg2NUMRzD9CizqaetGo5jY" name="how-to-backup-android-phone-combo-screenshot-pixel8.jpg" alt="how to backup android phone combo screenshot pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qg2NUMRzD9CizqaetGo5jY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3220" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Tap the <strong>Backup </strong>option.</p><p>5. Make sure the toggle for <strong>Backup by Google One</strong> is set to <strong>On</strong>.</p><p>6. Tap the <strong>Back up now</strong> button to sync your device&apos;s latest data to Google Drive. Do note that your phone will automatically back up its data regularly once this option is enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Go to <strong>contacts.google.com</strong> to see if all the contacts from your previous phone migrated to your Google account. The contacts that you see on this page will be the ones that show up on your new phone.</p>
<p>Once all the data has been backed up, you can get started with setting up your new phone. Before we do that, however, let&apos;s make sure all your photos and videos are being backed up to Google Photos.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-transfer-photos-and-videos-to-your-new-android-phone"><span>How to transfer photos and videos to your new Android phone</span></h3>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos" target="_blank">Google Photos</a> is an outstanding cloud service for backing up photos and videos. It seamlessly backs up data, offers granular sharing controls, and even uses on-device machine learning to automatically group faces. You can save your photos and videos at <strong>Original quality</strong>—the quality at which they were taken—or select <strong>Storage saver</strong>, which retains the same level of detail while cutting down on the size.</p>
<p>This is a good option to consider, as Google Photos doesn&apos;t offer unlimited uploads anymore; once you run out of storage, you&apos;ll have to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one" target="_blank">Google One</a> plan. That said, it is the best way to back up photos and videos from your Android phone. Once the data is backed up to the cloud, you&apos;ll be able to access all your photos and videos from your new phone and on the web. If you haven&apos;t configured Google Photos yet, here&apos;s how to get started.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Google Photos</strong> on your phone.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>your profile picture</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Photos settings</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="76tWWyfbhjmMJYWo6i52jk" name="google-photos-backup-steps.jpg" alt="How to transfer photos and videos to your new Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/76tWWyfbhjmMJYWo6i52jk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3264" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Select <strong>Backup & sync</strong>.</p><p>5. Make sure the toggle for <strong>Back up & sync</strong> is set to <strong>On</strong>.</p><p>6. Ensure that the <strong>Backup mode</strong> is set to <strong>High quality</strong>.</p>
<p>That&apos;s all there is to it. Once your photos and videos are safely backed up to Google Photos, you can get started with setting up your new phone.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-restore-data-and-settings-to-your-new-android-phone"><span>How to restore data and settings to your new Android phone</span></h3>
<p>You&apos;ve unboxed your new phone and are ready to set it up. There are a few ways to restore data from your older device, and here I&apos;m highlighting the option that has worked best for me over the years (I switch phones once every two weeks, so I know what I&apos;m talking about). </p><p>You&apos;ll need your old phone for this, so make sure you don&apos;t reset the data just yet. At this point, you should switch the SIM card over to the new phone. Let&apos;s get started.</p>
<p>1. Select your device language and hit <strong>Start</strong> on the welcome page.</p><p>2. Select your <strong>home Wi-Fi network</strong> and sign in.</p><p>3. Hit <strong>Next</strong> at the <strong>Copy apps & data</strong> screen to begin migrating data from your old phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.89%;"><img id="iKhV6ee4xQfqa4NsBkyLjH" name="restore-data-phone-1.jpg" alt="How to restore data and settings to your new Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iKhV6ee4xQfqa4NsBkyLjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3248" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Connect one end of a USB-C to USB-C cable to your old phone and tap <strong>Next</strong> on your new phone.</p><p>5. Now, plug in the other end of the USB-C to USB-C cable to your new phone.</p><p>6. Hit <strong>Next</strong> once again here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.71%;"><img id="mMmiZccD3J7P3Y6kx7iUrH" name="restore-data-phone-2.jpg" alt="How to restore data and settings to your new Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMmiZccD3J7P3Y6kx7iUrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3256" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From there, you just select everything that you&apos;d like to migrate from your old phone to your new one and follow the instructions. Android has become so intuitive that it even logs into your Google account and transfers all of your saved Wi-Fi passwords. Because this is a direct data transfer method, you won&apos;t need to enter your Google account password or use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a> — all your details are securely transferred over to the new device.</p>
<p>That&apos;s all there is to it. Once setup is finished and you get to the home screen, you&apos;ll see Google Play Store running in the background and restoring data from your old phone. This can take up to an hour depending on the amount of content installed on your old phone and your internet connection, so you can let it run while configuring the rest of the settings on your new phone.</p>
<p>In the event that something does not transfer over, you can restore your files and data from your cloud backups too. However, this method usually works incredibly smoothly.</p>

<p>If your new phone is a Samsung Galaxy phone, we have some good news. Samsung&apos;s proprietary app called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-samsung-smart-switch" target="_blank">Smart Switch</a> makes everything as simple and easy as Google&apos;s new data copying process. You can use the Smart Switch app to transfer all your data from your old Galaxy phone to your new Galaxy phone in almost exactly the same way.</p><p>All the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones" target="_blank">best Samsung phones</a> come with Samsung Smart Switch pre-installed. Can&apos;t find the app on your Samsung Galaxy? Don&apos;t worry, you can download it for free from Google Play Store.</p><p>So, whether your new phone is a top-tier flagship such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> or a mid-range phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-review" target="_blank">Galaxy A54 5G</a>, you can take advantage of Smart Switch to copy everything you need. Samsung Smart Switch even works offline, transferring all your settings, messages, data, call logs, and backgrounds over through a USB-C-to USB-C cable.</p><p>What I like best about Smart Switch is that it preserves state across devices — meaning your settings and home screen layout will move to the new phone, saving you the hassle of configuring it all over again.</p>

However, over the past couple of years, we&apos;ve seen new options arrive, aiming to put a bit of pressure on the incumbents.</p><p>Last year marked the first time that OnePlus got into the mix, as it introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a>. It combines a sleek and premium design with a gorgeous 144Hz display. Unfortunately, the software didn&apos;t really hit the mark, falling a bit short of our expectations.</p><p>Fast forward to now and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is here, hoping to fix those pesky software quirks, while also implementing some rather unique features.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 launched on July 16, 2024 at an event hosted in Milan, Italy. It was announced alongside other OnePlus devices, including the Nord 4, Nord Buds 3 Pro, and Watch 2R. The tablet officially went on sale on July 30, with a retail price of $549.</p><p>OnePlus also released several accessories for the Pad 2. These include the new Smart Keyboard, priced at $150, the Folio Case 2 for $40, and the Stylo 2 for $100.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-pad-2-design-and-display"><span>OnePlus Pad 2: Design and display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsRMAo973WtCoMj3Yqb7Ma" name="oneplus-pad-2-4.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 home page against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsRMAo973WtCoMj3Yqb7Ma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;ve previously checked out the original OnePlus Pad, then the design of the OnePlus Pad 2 should look right at home. It&apos;s clear that OnePlus didn&apos;t feel the need to do much in the way of changing up the design. The biggest difference is the introduction of a larger screen, as the Pad 2 relies on a 12.1-inch screen, up from the 11.6-inch display of its predecessor.</p><p>Those hoping to see OnePlus move to an OLED panel with the Pad 2 will be slightly disappointed. I say "slightly" because even though this is an IPS LCD panel, it does pack a punch with its 3K resolution. Although the colors aren&apos;t quite as punch as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, the OnePlus Pad 2 does look better than my docked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that while some might be disappointed in the decision to use an LCD panel, that won&apos;t be the case for everyone. As my colleague, Nick Sutrich, has detailed on numerous occasions, OLED displays are more prone to affect those suffering from PWM. Because of that, he&apos;s unable to use many devices with OLED displays, whereas the OnePlus Pad 2 might be the perfect tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ySawiUi8fccr5yniWmmRbm" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with Stylo 2 and Keyboard Cover" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySawiUi8fccr5yniWmmRbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, the Pad 2 does have another advantage here, as the display offers up to a 144Hz refresh rate. This edges out the Tab S9 Ultra&apos;s 120Hz panel, while absolutely blowing past the Pixel Tablet, which is stuck at 60Hz. As you might suspect, we have a bit of customization on this front, allowing you to stick to 60Hz, bump it up to 144Hz, or let the tablet pick for you with Auto Select.</p><p>As for the rest of the design, there&apos;s really not too much to write home about. On the back, you&apos;ll find a similar camera hump to the one from the original OnePlus Pad, housing a 13MP lens. Besides that, we have a total of six speakers, four of which are on the bottom (or right), with the other two found on the top (or left).</p><p>It&apos;s clear that OnePlus expects people to use this tablet in landscape orientation, as the 8MP selfie camera is buried in the bezel between the screen and frame. At the top, there&apos;s a flattened area where the new Stylo 2 can be stowed when not in use, which will also ensure that it&apos;s always charged and ready to go. While on the other side, there&apos;s a trio of pogo pins where the Smart Keyboard cover connects.</p><p>All-in-all, OnePlus did a solid job with the design, as there are only so many ways to design a slab of glass and metal. If there was anything I would complain about, it would be the need for more color options. Currently, the Pad 2 is only available in a "Nimbus Gray." Instead, I would&apos;ve preferred to see a color option similar to the "Emerald Dusk" of the OnePlus Open.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ZstesEAr8fojDQ6X2yWy4" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-15.jpg" alt="Tears of the Kingdom on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ZstesEAr8fojDQ6X2yWy4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rather surprisingly, the only other tablet to be released with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">Redmagic&apos;s Nova Gaming Tablet</a>. So if gaming isn&apos;t your forte but you want a powerful tablet, the OnePlus Pad 2 is the way to go, offering quite an impressive boost in terms of performance. Previously, OnePlus relied on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mediatek-calls-out-qualcomm-new-dimensity-9000-flagship-chipset">MediaTek Dimensity 9000</a> SoC, which was a solid choice, but it still fell behind the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><p>Paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, this immediately makes the OnePlus Pad 2 one of the best Android tablets in sheer performance alone. In the time that I&apos;ve spent with the Pad 2, I haven&apos;t really run into any issues in that regard.</p><p>Along with just using the tablet as a tablet, one of the things I like to use for benchmarking is seeing how well a device can handle Switch emulation. However, that&apos;s not really a "one-size-fits-all" approach for every device, so I also decided to run a few benchmarks. This includes Geekbench 6 along with 3DMark&apos;s Wild Life and Wild Life Extreme tests.</p><p>One thing that I had forgotten about is that OnePlus implements a "High-Performance Mode" into many of its devices. After rediscovering and turning on this mode, I re-ran the benchmarks and came away a bit surprised. For one, the standard "3D Mark Wild Life Stress Test" only lasted a few seconds before displaying "Maxed Out" results.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sooMmS324wBis75W4LjNE4" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-17.jpg" alt="Tears of the Kingdom FPS on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sooMmS324wBis75W4LjNE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also noticed that playing Tears of the Kingdom with the Pad 2 connected to a GameSir Galileo G8 controller resulted in much more stable frame rates. Instead of hovering between 15-25 fps with obvious graphical glitches, Tears of the Kingdom stayed at 20-30 fps with no artifacts or glitches. It doesn&apos;t play flawlessly, but if you want to play more intensive games, you&apos;ll want to enable the High Performance Mode.</p><p>The biggest downside to keeping this enabled is that the battery will drain a bit faster than if it were turned off. Even still, the OnePlus Pad 2 continued to impress during my testing, especially in the standby time. Every time I reached for the tablet, it still had some juice left in the tank.</p><p>And as I&apos;m writing this review from the Pad 2, I started with about 85%, and the battery is currently sitting at 56%. Mind you, that&apos;s over the course of about two hours, with the display not timing out, while also using Open Canvas, switching between apps, with both the Smart Keyboard and Stylo 2 attached.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RUb3SQFtyHxQmAXxzvNY8B" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-23.jpg" alt="Charging animation on the OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUb3SQFtyHxQmAXxzvNY8B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, battery life is one of those things that I don&apos;t feel the need to be overly concerned about with the OnePlus Pad 2. Even when the juice has been fully squeezed, we have 67W charging speeds courtesy of SuperVOOC charging. OnePlus claims that it takes almost an hour and a half to go from 0-100%, and as long as you have a compatible charging brick, you&apos;re good to go.</p><p>That&apos;s really the only catch here, as while OnePlus includes a USB-A to USB-C cable in the box, that&apos;s all you&apos;ll find. Unfortunately, the company has adopted the tradition of not including a charger in the box. Instead, you&apos;ll have to come out of pocket for a fast-charging brick, provided that you don&apos;t already have one.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-pad-2-accessories"><span>OnePlus Pad 2: Accessories</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hRp53ryFfdPECGWgTtuBXi" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-3.jpg" alt="OnePlus Stylo 2 logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hRp53ryFfdPECGWgTtuBXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a new tablet that also comes with a larger design, this gave OnePlus the opportunity to release a few new accessories. This includes a redesigned Smart Keyboard, in addition to the OnePlus Stylo 2. As is the case with the charging brick, OnePlus does not include any additional accessories in the box, meaning that you&apos;ll be looking at spending another $250 to get the keyboard and stylus.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I was surprised to see OnePlus move away from iPad-like keyboard design, which made the OnePlus Pad "float" above the keyboard. However, it didn&apos;t take long for my opinion to change, as this isn&apos;t just another boring keyboard attachment.</p><p>It seems as though OnePlus took a page out of Microsoft&apos;s playbook, as the new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard can be used attached, or detached, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a>. This is the same premise found with the OnePlus Pad Smart Keyboard, as it attaches to the bottom of the Pad 2 via pogo pins.</p><p>However, if you remove the connection, the Pad 2 and Smart Keyboard will stay connected, effectively working as a Bluetooth keyboard. As I recently picked up the Surface Pro 11 and Flex Keyboard for myself, I can&apos;t tell you how much I love this idea and am excited to see it come to the OnePlus Pad 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xuhHs38gZ3szzkcsGmnzTA" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with Keyboard Disconnected - closer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuhHs38gZ3szzkcsGmnzTA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s actually as practical as I like to think, but there&apos;s definitely something to be said about the convenience. OnePlus even thought about the "flexible ribbon" between the tablet and keyboard, as you can just fold it up and the ribbon won&apos;t get in the way.</p><p>This brings us to my biggest gripe about the keyboard, as I&apos;m just not a fan of how flimsy this flexible ribbon is when attached to the tablet. When I&apos;m using the Pad 2 and Smart Keyboard in my lap, everything just shifts and moves around too much for my liking. As a result, I&apos;ll either just take the keyboard off and prop up the screen with my legs stretched out, or I&apos;ll just ditch the keyboard and work directly from the tablet.</p><p>Something else I would&apos;ve liked to see is for OnePlus to take Microsoft&apos;s approach to how the ribbon attaches to the top of the keyboard. Currently, it rolls upward, with the pogo pins facing you, and stays in place thanks to the built-in magnets. However, I would&apos;ve much preferred for it to be able to roll in the opposite direction, putting a bit of a slope on the keyboard for better ergonomics when the two are separated.</p><p>That being said, if there&apos;s one thing I do love, it&apos;s a big trackpad, and OnePlus doesn&apos;t disappoint. It&apos;s large enough that I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m using a child&apos;s toy, but not too large that I have to deal with my palms accidentally tapping and moving the cursor around. It also offers a satisfying click, one of which is much better than what you&apos;ll find from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">Samsung&apos;s Book Cover Keyboard</a>, and it&apos;s even better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YDB4A7B3Efc8dzpFUw6W4h" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 keyboard angled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YDB4A7B3Efc8dzpFUw6W4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a couple of other tricks that OnePlus tossed into its Smart Keyboard. The first of which is that there&apos;s a dedicated AI key, sandwiched between the Search and Alt keys. Currently, this only serves as a way to summon Google Assistant or Gemini, but OnePlus has bigger plans down the road. More AI features are on the way, as the company claims software updates are coming later this year to add new functionality.</p><p>Arguably the more exciting feature is found on the right side of the keyboard, on the palm rest. This is where you&apos;ll find a not-so-subtle NFC logo, as the Smart Keyboard has built-in NFC capabilities. Provided that you&apos;re also using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>, this will let you quickly and easily connect the two devices.</p><p>In doing so, you&apos;re able to send files back and forth, and can even mirror the screen from your phone to your tablet. Think of it like having Phone Hub on your Chromebook, but between the OnePlus Pad 2 and a OnePlus phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iMHAwthLHVXSkpMY5sa4qh" name="oneplus-pad-2-stylo-2-up-close.jpg" alt="OnePlus Stylo 2 up-close on OnePlus logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMHAwthLHVXSkpMY5sa4qh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching gears over to the Stylo 2, I couldn&apos;t be happier to see that OnePlus offers a stylus, even if it doesn&apos;t come in the box. This is one area where Samsung still has an advantage, seeing as the company includes an S Pen with many of its Galaxy Tab devices.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Stylo 2 is an excellent companion to the OnePlus Pad 2, and I&apos;d argue that it&apos;s a must-buy even if you decide against getting the Smart Keyboard. For one, it&apos;s pressure-sensitive, making it great for artists who want to apply different strokes when using the Pad 2 to draw.</p><p>Since I&apos;m not much of an artist, the more important feature to me is the subtle feedback I get when jotting down notes. I would probably even go so far as to say that it&apos;s almost on par with using an Apple Pencil on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">iPad</a>, and is better than what you get with the Galaxy Tab and an S Pen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f" name="oneplus-pad-2-stylo-2-notes-app.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with Notes app open and Stylo 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FtyN6zA3XTxzign7yKn49f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I&apos;m a big fan of is that the Stylo 2 is more comfortable to actually use. One of my complaints with the S Pen is that the ultra-slim design just isn&apos;t great for someone with meaty paws. My hands end up cramping after just a few minutes, a problem that I&apos;ve yet to run into with the Stylo 2.</p><p>OnePlus also did the smart thing here as I can just attach the Stylo 2 to the top of the Pad 2 when I&apos;m not using it. Not only does it provide peace of mind that I didn&apos;t leave it behind, but I&apos;ll never have to worry about the battery running out either. It&apos;s nice to see more and more tablets adopt this functionality, as it&apos;s one less thing I have to worry about keeping charged.</p>

<p>If you used a OnePlus phone from the past few years, then you&apos;ll feel right at home with the OnePlus Pad 2. The tablet ships with OxygenOS 14.1, which is unsurprisingly based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. In my time with the Pad 2, I&apos;ve already received a few updates, mainly focused on bug fixes, but it&apos;s still been nice to see.</p><p>With that in mind, you&apos;ll get the same experience here as you would on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. There are a boatload of options in the Settings app, but the star of the show is Open Canvas, which first debuted on the OnePlus Open.</p><p>This is a completely different approach to multitasking compared to what you&apos;ll find on the Galaxy Tab S10 series and other Android tablets. Instead of splitting the screen and resizing windows, you can have three full-screen apps running at the same time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tSsL2fuZpMoavesmexrEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The benefit of this is that you don&apos;t have to worry about apps not working properly, or having content cut off for the sake of adding more apps to the screen. However, Open Canvas does let you do that, showing three apps at the same time, if you really want to.</p><p>Although it&apos;s not exactly revolutionary, there&apos;s something to be said about OnePlus thinking outside of the box to bring something unique to its tablet. When you have a big screen in front of you, it makes sense that you want to take advantage of the screen real estate, and Open Canvas lets you do just that.</p>

<p>When looking at the current landscape of tablets, the OnePlus Pad 2 is kind of an anomaly. In terms of power, the closest competition is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a>, which relies on Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The Tab S9 does gain an advantage by featuring an AMOLED display, as opposed to the LCD panel on the Pad 2. However, you&apos;ll also pay at least $200 more for the Tab S9, which is quite a steep price to pay, even with the benefits Samsung tablets have to offer.</p><p>Then, there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, which is either the same price or only $100 cheaper than the Pad 2, depending on whether you want the Charging Speaker Dock or not. There&apos;s also a matter of performance, as the Tensor G2 just doesn&apos;t match up to the best Snapdragon processors, let alone the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And while it&apos;s great that you can use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a> with the Pixel Tablet, you&apos;ll be relying on third-party solutions for that and a keyboard.</p><p>I&apos;d argue the stiffest competition to the OnePlus Pad 2 comes from Apple, with the iPad (10th Generation). Despite being powered by an outdated chipset, the A14 Bionic, it&apos;s no secret that Apple excels when it comes to optimization. Not to mention that the iPad costs $150 less than the Pad 2. And if you want a tablet with a bit more power, the 11-inch iPad Air features Apple&apos;s M2 chip and is only $100 more than the OnePlus Pad 2.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the most powerful Android tablet.</li><li>You already have a OnePlus phone and want to enjoy the ecosystem.</li><li>You don't want to spend an arm and a leg for a performant tablet.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a tablet with expandable storage.</li><li>You need (or want) better biometrics.</li></ul>
<p>The biggest appeal of the OnePlus Pad 2 is its price, retailing at $549, but can regularly be found for less. With that, you get a 12.1-inch screen, the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, and pretty great battery life. Not to mention the various features that enhance the experience if you already have a OnePlus phone.</p><p><em>This</em> is the tablet that I had hoped to see last year, but I&apos;m happy to see OnePlus deliver the second time around. It gives me hope that people can realize that you don&apos;t need to spend more than $500 on a good Android tablet. In turn, hopefully, we&apos;ll see even more options hit the market.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Oura Ring 4 is the latest generation of smart ring from Finnish company, Oura, after essentially starting the new wearable trend with its Gen 3 ring, which launched in 2021. The smart ring brings a number of notable upgrades compared to its well-received predecessor, which promises to make it more accurate, more durable, and last longer. However, in the time span between models, the wearable landscape has changed quite a bit, and Oura has more to contend with.</p><p>Competition among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> has heated up recently, particularly in 2024, when we&apos;ve seen follow-ups from smaller companies and new models from larger companies. This includes Samsung and Amazfit, both of whom are well-versed in smartwatches, with the hopes that their ecosystems will help drive adoption.</p><p>So, is the Oura Ring 4 still competitive in 2024, where most other options bring similar features and don&apos;t require a subscription? After using the smart ring for a couple of week, I think it shows growth in the right places that keep it on top, but the gap may not be as wide as it once was.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-4-price-and-availability"><span>Oura Ring 4: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-09.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 with the Android Bot figure" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2sq9v3PBhKKwpjmEkYARNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Oura Ring 4 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">announced</a> on October 3 and was immediately available for preorder. It is available in stores and ships on October 15 with a starting price of $349.</p><p>The ring comes in sizes 4-15 and is available in six different colors/finishes, which vary in price. The color/price breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Silver, Black: $349</li><li>Brushed Silver, Stealth: $399</li><li>Gold, Rose Gold: $499</li></ul>
<p>When purchasing a new ring online, you will be sent a sizing kit at no additional cost to determine what size ring you will receive. However, you can also opt out of this if you know your size (which seem to fall in line with the previous generation).</p><p>In addition to the hardware cost, there is an additional $6 monthly subscription to the Oura Membership, which gets you access to many of the ring&apos;s features. You can also pay for a yearly subscription at $69.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 is FSA/HSA eligible.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-4-what-i-like"><span>Oura Ring 4: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xbC9tSxEW5LTAYAWeAeqUm" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-04.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on a white surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbC9tSxEW5LTAYAWeAeqUm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3841" height="2161" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was a fan of the design of the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a>, which had a unique "flat top" design that made it easy to discern if it was being worn right-side-up. It later adopted a fully round design with the Horizon style rings, which is the starting point for the Oura Ring 4. But while the outside may look nearly identical to its predecessor, Oura has made some important changes to its overall design to improve durability and comfort.</p><p>First, the all-titanium design makes the ring look and feel much more durable than its predecessor, which featured a non-metallic epoxy inner surface. This time around, you can&apos;t see any of the ring circuitry, and the only thing that&apos;s visible are the sensors, which have also been changed. Some users may be happy to know that the three pumps lining the inside of the ring are no longer present. In fact, there are a couple of indentations on the otherwise flat inner surface between the sensors and LEDs.</p><p>I never had an issue with the protruding sensors on the Oura Ring Gen 3, but the new design feels quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, and I think anyone moving from the previous version would agree. That comfort should help maintain the ring&apos;s all-day health tracking. In fact, Oura also says the all-titanium design improves the ring sensor pathways, which means better accuracy and fewer "gaps" in heart rate or blood oxygen readings.</p>

<p>My ring is the Brushed Silver option, which is the middle of the road in terms of cost. I personally don&apos;t care for glossy finishes, so I like that Oura provides a number of options for people who like either. My Gen 3 scuffs and scratches pretty easily, but I haven&apos;t noticed this to the same degree with the Oura Ring 4, which has so far managed to keep its pristine looks through a couple of weeks of exercises and other activities. Still, I would recommend you try to find some sort of smart ring cover if you plan to work with it, which, unfortunately, Oura doesn&apos;t provide.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the improved design, Oura also promises better battery life with up to eight days per charge. I&apos;ve only managed to get seven days per charge, which falls short of some competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a>&apos;s 12 days of battery life, but it&apos;s nothing to snuff at. In fact, I imagine you could squeeze out more battery life depending on the features you have enabled and the amount of activity the find is monitoring. Aside from automatic detection (which I&apos;ll get to in the next section), I would often manually record one or two workouts a day, which could run down the battery more.</p><p>The charging situation hasn&apos;t really improved, with the ring taking as long as 80 minutes to charge, but the new metal charger looks much better than the rather cheaply designed plastic charger of the previous model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="biWhAp3K9FyaAfr5zgyZ35" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-14.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on its charging dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/biWhAp3K9FyaAfr5zgyZ35.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3921" height="2206" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from hardware upgrade on the ring, the Oura app has also received a rather major overhaul. Instead of adding more tabs at the bottom, which was seemingly Oura&apos;s previous M.O., the app has in-fact reduced the number of tabs to three. The result is an app that is much easier to use, with navigation that just feels more logical. The Today tab is pretty much a view of your day, including Readiness and Sleep, Resilience levels, stress graph, and more.</p><p>One of the best additions to the Today tab is the Timeline at the bottom, which automatically logs activities throughout your day (although you can also manually add activities). At the top of the Today tab, you also have shortcuts to individual metrics available in the Vitals tab. These are the metrics that dynamically change your scores in the Today tab and you can view detailed insights on each, which a mini navigation bar to easily switch between each vital reading.</p>

<p>Finally, there&apos;s the My Health tab, which focuses on the more slowly-moving metrics, including Resilience, heart health, and sleep health. Like me, you&apos;ll probably visit this tab not as frequently as the other two, but it&apos;s a great way to see where you&apos;re at and how you&apos;re trending.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-4-health-tracking"><span>Oura Ring 4: Health tracking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZTBQd32nc6trm5PhMVmu9A" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-13.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on a phone with the Oura app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZTBQd32nc6trm5PhMVmu9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll find the typical range of health tracking metrics available on the the Oura Ring 4. The device utilizes a new sensing platform dubbed Smart Sensing that optimizes the rings sensors to improve accuracy and battery life. As such, while the Oura Ring Gen 3 was still plenty accurate, this new model should prove more consistently accurate overall.</p><p>For instance, sleep tracking is one of my favorite use cases for a smart ring, as it&apos;s much more comfortable than wearing a smartwatch to bed. The Oura Ring 4 is incredibly detailed when it comes to sleep tracking, providing details I didn&apos;t know I needed, but ultimately, they will help me better understand how I sleep and how I can improve.</p>

<p>Comparing my sleep stages with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, the results are more or less a match, with usually slightly shorter times on the ring. I&apos;ll find that others metrics are pretty much within range and more or less match the PW3, which I find encouraging for the Oura Ring 4.</p><p>I haven&apos;t slept all that well these past few weeks, and while I know that based on how I feel when I wake up, the ring essentially corroborates that based on my fairly middling sleep scores. As a result, the app reminds me that I should prioritize sleep this week solely based on my average scores from the previous week. It will also remind me daily that I should probably chill and take more time for recovery based on how much exercise I do.</p>

<p>Speaking of exercise, one of my favorite things about the Oura Ring Gen 3 was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">Automatic Activity Detection (AAD)</a>, which is good enough to even detect when I&apos;m dancing. This feature has been improved with the Oura Ring 4, with the ring automatically monitoring your heart rate when it detects you are doing an activity, which helps fill a missing piece of your daily activity metrics.</p><p>Given the rather passive nature of a smart ring, this will give you less reason to open the Oura app, knowing that it should do the work for you. As with the Ring Gen 3, AAD isn&apos;t perfect, and sometimes it won&apos;t know exactly what you were doing at a certain time, meaning you&apos;ll have to manually edit the activity, but more often than not, the ring will at least detect <em>something</em>. That said, if you know you&apos;re going to be doing a certain workout or activity, I find it&apos;s best to still manually track it and let the ring fill the blanks with anything extra.</p><p>The manual selection is still limited, but you can always set it to one of the five options and change it later.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU" name="Oura-app-activity-heart-rate-details.jpg" alt="Oura app activity tracking" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wooFHuUPnNkAZvvXwWLmqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can manually track workouts like Indoor running. The ring will also record heart rate data for auto-detected activities like walking and more. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Activity tracking is particularly useful when monitoring stress, which takes heart rate, motion, temperature, and heart rate variability into account. The stress graph ranges from restored to stressed and will show when you&apos;re in each of the four zones and what activities you were doing during certain times. The goal is to help better identify and understand stressors in your life, and the app will encourage you to reflect on these. Whether I will or not is between me and my therapist, but it&apos;s nice to have a visual reference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.30%;"><img id="EZE5DYzxZu2dh5wpFVdgbe" name="Oura-app-stress-graph.jpg" alt="Stress graph on the Oura app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZE5DYzxZu2dh5wpFVdgbe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="307" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among the new additions for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is Oura Labs (but was already available for iOS users), which lets users try out experimental features ahead of their "official" release on the app. Among these is an AI-powered Oura Advisor, a sort of chatbot that aims to help you better understand your metrics and provide personalized advice on how to improve them.</p><p>From my fairly limited experience with Advisor, it feels like a conversational way to get much of the information already provided by the app. I can see how it can be useful, especially if you want to ask specific questions on ways to optimize sleep or improve resilience. In addition to the already useful nudges the Oura app provides, Advisor can ping you with notifications at least once a day to check in, which I find to be a great motivator and a way to remind you about your progress.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.65%;"><img id="LyisDFkYUzrA4zL7KpiXpV" name="Oura-Labs-Advisor-Meals.jpg" alt="Oura Labs: Advisor and Meal logging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyisDFkYUzrA4zL7KpiXpV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3440" height="2740" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meals is another new feature Android users can try out. It lets you log your meals and beverages (they&apos;ll show up on your Timeline) by manually typing or taking a photo. The app analyzes the image or text and can guess or extrapolate the food you&apos;re trying to log and the likely ingredients. It will use this information to help you figure out an optimal meal schedule based on your body clock, with the goal of helping reduce hunger and excessive snacking (a problem for me).</p><p>I haven&apos;t had much time to test this feature, so I can&apos;t speak on its usefulness, but so far, I&apos;m impressed with its ability to guess what food I&apos;m logging when uploading a photo. For instance, it was able to correctly guess that I was eating avocado toast with micro greens and even listed the balsamic glaze among the ingredients, which even I wouldn&apos;t have known if it weren&apos;t for the fact that I had the ingredients in front of me on a menu. I did have to manually add the chili flakes, but I&apos;m excited to play with this feature more.</p><p>Of course, I would like to see this data sync with MyFitnessPal, since that&apos;s what I use to track my macros, but there are some nutrition-based app integrations with the Oura app that users can look into.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Oura is trying its hand at AI with some impressive features like Meals, which aims to help you set a good eating schedule to aid in your daily readiness.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Step tracking for the Oura Ring 4 is still hit or miss, with the ring logging in fewer or more steps than my smartwatches, often by the hundreds. It&apos;s not terrible, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">step tracking on smart rings is getting better</a>, but Oura says this is something it&apos;s working on improving. For now, take step counts with a grain of salt, and you&apos;ll likely want to rely on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> for this.</p><p>For users who experience periods, there&apos;s also mensural tracking and the ability to help determine a fertile window for those trying to get pregnant. I personally cannot try these features, but Android Central editor-in-chief, Shruti Shekar, has done some preliminary testing of the former and has so far come out impressed:</p><p>"I plan to do more in-depth testing on the menstrual cycle tracking feature, but for now, I can absolutely say that the Oura Ring 4 is one of the best smart rings on the market right now. I got my ring just shy of four days of getting my period for the month. After installing and setting up the ring with the info that was transferred from my previous ring, the app was already able to figure out when I was about to get my period. More on the features soon.</p><p>But in general, I am so in love with this ring and the new design of the app, and I genuinely think Oura knocked it out of the ballpark."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-4-what-needs-work"><span>Oura Ring 4: What needs work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-05.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6rqtLGT5c8GDWFRrfMqvyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Oura Ring 4 isn&apos;t the most expensive smart ring on the market (that honor goes to a certain Samsung ring), the base model now costs $50 more than its predecessor, which is just the first cost-related consideration you have to make. However, in addition to that, you also have to consider the monthly cost of the Oura Membership, which gets you access to the more useful features (and trust me, you&apos;ll want it).</p><p>How you feel about the $5.99 subscription may vary from person to person, and while I personally don&apos;t find it particularly offensive, I can understand why the added cost may not appeal to everyone, especially at a time when we already have to worry about everything turning into a subscription service. That said, I have friends on the membership who don&apos;t seem to mind or really care about the cost, with one even saying he just doesn&apos;t think about it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's tempting to skip the membership, but it gets you access to the features that make the Oura Ring 4 unique. You'll want that membership.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Feature-wise, the Oura Ring 4 comes with nearly everything I would want in a smart ring. That said, there&apos;s no dedicated AFib detection feature like what&apos;s on the way for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, although it can help users identify symptoms associated with it, particularly via heart rate variation. There&apos;s also no sleep apnea detection, but again, you could use sleep-tracking details to help identify potential episodes.</p><p>One feature I would like to see come to Android is location tracking for the ring itself. I&apos;ve lost two Gen 3 smart rings because I could not remember where I last took them off my finger, and I would hate to lose the Oura Ring 4. iPhone users already have a Find My Ring feature, which shows the ring&apos;s last known location, and I would love to see this on Android.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-4-competition"><span>Oura Ring 4: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-wearing.jpg" alt="Wearing the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tktjukwZRiF8zyjEbTsqCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura&apos;s biggest competitor at the moment is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>, which relies on the popular Galaxy ecosystem to drive adoption. It&apos;s more expensive, but there&apos;s no subscription, and it ties in with Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> for insights on your health, which can be tied in with data from your Galaxy smartwatch. That said, in our experience, Samsung still has a long way to go, with unreliable sleep tracking and limited fitness tracking capabilities.</p><p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is an impressive device with a 12-day battery life, the longest we know of on a smart ring. Its signature sleep apnea feature has the potential to be invaluable for anyone who may suffer from the condition, although it can drain the battery quickly. The ring is also slightly cheaper and without a subscription, but the insights and other details may seem pretty basic compared to Oura.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't like wearing a smartwatch to bed</li><li>You don't mind the $6 monthly subscription</li><li>You want a stylish smart ring to replace or supplement your smartwatch</li><li>You need help getting pregnant</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't want to pay for a monthly subscription</li><li>You lose rings easily</li><li>You own the Oura Ring Gen 3</li></ul>
<p>It was hard to imagine how Oura could follow up on its already impressive Gen 3 smart ring, but the company managed to pull it off. The new design and Smart Sensing platform have taken the ring to the next level, and the Oura Ring 4 is a solid wearable that anyone should want if they&apos;re looking to take charge of their health and wellness. It has more features and capabilities than you could imagine would come from such a small device, and knowing Oura&apos;s track record, this is only the beginning.</p><p>No one likes the idea of paying a monthly subscription, especially if the benefits aren&apos;t immediately and obviously clear. A streaming service is one thing, but a passive smart ring could be a hard sell for some. That said, if you can get past the $6 monthly charge to use its best features, the Oura Ring 4 is a smart ring that deserves a place on your finger.</p>

<hr>
<p>Xiaomi has got some impressive Android tablets lined up for various regions, including the Xiaomi Pad 6 series, which is due for a refresh. A recent leak from China spills some details on the upcoming Xiaomi Pad 7 and Pad 7 Pro.</p><p>The leak comes from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3108827753/OB2cHt3cv">Weibo post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_pad_7_and_pad_7_pro_specs_leak-news-64900.php">GSMArena</a>), which indicates that the Xiaomi Pad 7 and the Pad 7 Pro may share the same 11.6-inch LCD screen with a 144Hz refresh rate display.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&apos;s current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship tablet</a>—the Pad 6S Pro—also has the same refresh rate, although it has a larger screen measuring 12.4 inches.

<p>Roku introduced a refreshed Roku Ultra device in September 2024 with a new quad-core processor that Roku claims delivers 30% faster performance. The box also gets Wi-Fi 6 and comes bundled with the Roku Voice Remote Pro (2nd Gen). This is the best streaming device that Roku offers, but it&apos;s also the most expensive at $99.99, although it&apos;s often on sale for $79.99. </p><p>The Roku Ultra (2024) supports all the major HDR formats like Dolby Vision and HDR10+. It has an HDMI 2.1 port which allows it to offers smoother transitions between different refresh rates or content sources on compatible TVs. If you have a Wi-Fi 6 router at home, you&apos;ll be able to take advantage of the faster speeds with the new Ultra streaming box. Roku says the Ultra offers the best Roku experience, whether your watching live TV, free streaming apps, or the one&apos;s you&apos;ve subscribed to. The new powerful box allows you to pair Bluetooth headphones directly with it, so you don&apos;t have bother with a wired headset plugged into the remote.</p><p>Speaking of the remote, the new Voice Remote Pro supports voice commands and quick access to volume buttons, but it is also backlit, making it easier to use in the dark. If you&apos;ve misplaced the remote somewhere in the house, simply press the remote finder button on the box or use a simple voice command to help you find it.</p>

<p>The Roku Streaming Stick 4K is just about the perfect streaming device for most people with a 4K TV. As it&apos;s a streaming stick, it hides behind the TV and is powered by USB so if you wall-mount your display, you don&apos;t have any extra wires hanging down from behind. On the technical side, this device is one of Roku&apos;s most capable streaming devices with support for 4K HDR with Dolby Vision, HDR 10/10+, and even HLG which mostly means that if it&apos;s in HDR and you can stream it, this stick can play it. Wi-Fi 5 with MIMO is supported so you also get plenty of speed to stream without buffering.</p><p>This cheaper model works with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri for voice control. There is no USB port on this device and as a result, no local storage playback will be possible. The Micro-USB port on this streaming stick is only for power.</p><p>With a low price and great support for 4K and HDR, this streaming stick is the best bet for most people looking for a high-quality image without spending money on extra features they won&apos;t use like the Pro remote or local playback.</p>

<p>The Roku Express 4K+ streaming device keeps both, the improved design and great starter price of the previous Roku Express. The Express 4K+ comes with an adhesive tape so you can stick it to the bottom of the TV, which is great if your TV is wall-mounted and you don&apos;t want dangling cables.</p><p>While the standard Roku Express tops out at HD resolution, the Roku Express 4K+ streams HD, 4K, and HDR content for just $10 more. It also features a more powerful processor, dual-band Wi-Fi support, and an upgraded voice remote. Unlike the previous remote, the upgraded Roku voice remote allows you to navigate the streaming service and control your TV&apos;s power and volume from the same device.</p><p>Roku is marketing the Express 4K+ as "the most affordable way to stream in 4K," and it&apos;s not wrong. The device is also easy to set up, making it a great option for first-time streamers. However, experienced streamers who want to add a high-quality and affordable streaming device to every room with a TV should also consider grabbing a Express 4K+ or two.</p>

<p>Roku seems to have discontinued the Streambar Pro, which was it&apos;s most powerful and premium soundbar. The Roku Streambar is not its direct replacement, but it&apos;s the best soundbar that Roku offers at the moment. You can plug this into your existing TV and stream Roku&apos;s services without needing a Roku streamer, which is its main selling point. You&apos;ll also get much better audio quality than your TV speakers thanks to the four 1.9-inch full-range drivers in the soundbar.</p><p>The Streambar supports up to 4K streaming with HDR support. Sadly it can&apos;t do HDR10+ or Dolby Vision, but ironically, the cheaper Streambar SE does support HDR10+ playback. The latter is also far cheaper if you can get it on sale, but it lacks Ethernet, voice search funtion on the remote, and doesn&apos;t support Dolby Audio. </p><p>You can expand the audio fidelity of the Streambar by adding in two Roku Wireless Speakers and the Roku Wireless Bass subwoofer, for a proper home-theatre experience. The Streambar can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker or you can pair your headphones to it so you don&apos;t disturb your partner at night.</p>

<p>Roku has its own line of smart TVs now, ranging across three different series. If you&apos;re looking for the best though, there&apos;s only the Roku Pro Series that you should be considering. These 4K QLED TVs come in 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch screen sizes. There&apos;s full-array local dimming Mini LEDs for the backlighting, which means you should expect greater control over bright and dark areas in HDR content with little blooming. The panels also support Dolby Vision IQ, along with the other usual HDR formats. </p><p>Roku Pro Series also feature AI-powered picture corrections like Roku Smart Picture Max which intelligently cleans up the source signal and optimizes it for the TV&apos;s size. The TVs also feature slim bezels and a stylish frame, which should blend well with most entertainment setups. Roku also has a feature similar to Samsung Frame series called Backdrops. You can choose a static shot of a painting from famour artists and photogrphers or even upload your own personal photos and use the TV as a giant photo frame.</p><p>The Roku Pro Series 4K TVs ships with the Voice Remote Pro (2nd gen), giving you all the benefits like backlit buttons and USB-C charging. The TV&apos;s built-in speakers support Dolby Atmos, but you can take it a step further by pairing it with other Roku speakers and subwoofers for a vastly better audio experience.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Roku Wireless Speakers is that they promise to deliver outstanding sound for your Roku TV setup. They are bundled as a stereo pair and are incredibly easy to set up with your Roku TV or Streambar. They support Bluetooth streaming so that you can enjoy your favorite audio from any compatible Bluetooth device. Each speaker contains a 0.75-inch tweeter and a 3.5-inch woofer.</p><p>If you want to enhance your Roku TV&apos;s audio setup, the Wireless Speakers is a great place to start. Depending on how far you want to go, you can add a subfoofer and a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar into the mix, or add another pair of these stereo speakers for a full, surround sound experience. Keep in mind that these speakers won&apos;t work with any other TV or even Roku streaming players, as they only pair with Roku TVs and the Streambar series.</p>

The Oura Ring 4 smart ring is designed to automatically detect exercise, workouts, and other distinct movements, like gardening or walking the dog. That’s thanks to a feature called Automatic Activity Detection (AAD) that can track more than 40 different activities automatically. This ranges from runs and walks to even housework or swimming.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-to-know-about-oura-ring-4-and-aad-2">What to know about Oura Ring 4 and AAD</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AAD feature in Oura Ring enhances the experience by providing and tracking even more information. Along with logging duration and distance for certain activities, it can also provide an average heart rate and heart rate zone information once the Oura Ring 4 detects that you’re in the middle of a specific activity among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063022993-Automatic-Activity-Detection">40 supported activities</a>. (It can do this if you manually queue up a workout as well). </p><p>When the activity is done, you can look in the app and see a heart rate chart that shows how long you spent in each of the six heart rate zones. This will help you determine the intensity of the workout and if you need to ramp up the next time or slow down because you’re staying in a target heart rate zone for too long. It will also give you an idea of which activities get your heart rate up the most or help you keep consistent numbers. </p><p>There’s also a bar chart at the bottom of the Activity detail card that will add up your total activity minutes for the week and how these relate to metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. </p><p>Oura calculates the heart rate zones, which range from slow movements and recovery to all-out all-out effort whereby your heart and respiratory system are working at maximum capacity, by using a formula that takes into account your maximum heart rate combined with your age, how long the activity lasted, and additional metrics. </p><p>The feature, which is coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> members as well as Gen 3 members, means even if you forget to start tracking a workout, the ring will detect that you’re doing something, potentially even know what specifically you’re doing, and start tracking it so you get credit for your hard work. So, no more frustratingly stamping your feet because you&apos;re halfway through a 5K run and forgot to start the workout.</p><p>Oura says that AAD is about 89 percent accurate within one minute, and it is able to detect all types of activities based on the way you’re moving, your heart rate, and other factors. Some of the most popular activities it can track, according to Oura, include walking, yoga, hiking, yard work, and housework. Once you are doing the activity for at least 10 minutes, the ring should kick in and realize what’s going on. The more you perform any of these activities or others Oura Ring can detect, the better the smart ring will get at automatically detecting them. </p><p>Introduced in early October 2024, Oura Ring 4 is the latest generation of the company’s smart ring. At its heart is Smart Sensing technology that works with research-grade sensors to adapt to your finger and deliver continuous and accurate data. Lightweight with a smooth interior and thin shape, Oura says it’s also more comfortable than previous generation models. It’s also available in an expanded range of sizes, from 4 up to 15. </p><p>We have already named the Oura Ring Gen 3 smart ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">the best smart ring</a> you can buy. We’re confident the Oura Ring 4 will overtake this model as the new favorite for smart ring buyers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next flagship trio is (likely) a few months away, and a new report claims it&apos;s already making grand success goals.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30535">The Elec</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly aiming to produce a substantial amount of Galaxy S25 devices to meet its estimated demand (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-expects-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-to-be-half-of-all-S25-series-sales_id163650">Phone Arena</a>). Per the company&apos;s supply orders, the goal is to produce roughly 22 million Galaxy S25 series devices by June 2025. The publication claims Samsung expects its Galaxy S25 Ultra model to make up ~11 million of its produced devices.</p><p>The report states Samsung will begin "mass production" of the Galaxy S25 series parts in October. Moreover, the actual assembling of the devices could start in December. Samsung is expected to have 2 million S25 devices ready by December with 5 million on the assembly line in January.</p><p>The publication states Samsung expects its base model to account for ~30% of the sales in North America and Europe. Samsung reportedly sees its S25 Plus as a hit (again), as its outlook puts it around 35% to 40% in sales for North America.</p><p>Samsung allegedly sees Galaxy S25 Ultra sales in North America strive for 30%, but they may stay closer to 20% in Europe.</p><p>All in all, the "volume" and sales number of the S25 series are estimated to be similar to the Galaxy S24 series. The publication notes that Samsung could seek 30 million S25 devices produced by the end of 2025.</p><p>What’s really interesting about Samsung’s estimates for the Galaxy S25 Plus is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">how well the S24 version did</a>. It gave Samsung an 8% revenue boost compared to the S23 Plus. The S24 Plus came with cool upgrades that users loved, like more RAM, a sharper QHD+ display, and powerful on-device AI.</p><p>There were also rumors that Samsung may drop the Plus model, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-discontinued-rumors">those were quickly refuted</a>, likely because it found success in 2024.</p><p>The next flagship trio is expected to debut sometime in January if Samsung&apos;s past behavior is any indication. Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">leaked renders</a> suggest the series is moving into a thin phone era with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">flat sides and rounded corners</a>.</p>

However, you will have to keep cost into account, as Oura charges different prices for different colors.</p><p>So, what are the color options you can choose from, and which is the best for you?

<p>You&apos;ll find a lot more to choose from here than you will with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">Galaxy Ring color options</a>. Every hue of the Oura Ring 4 looks great and it&apos;s important that you take into account your current jewelry and that types of things you like to wear. You should also consider your lifestyle; are you more active and often using your hands? If so, the glossy options like silver and gold may not be the best options, as they may likely be easier to scratch and scuff. The brushed metal colors like the Brushed Silver finish may be better options, as it would be much better at hiding those.</p><p>However, not every Oura Ring 4 is created the same, and how much you pay will depend on the color option you select. Here&apos;s the breakdown of the Oura Ring 4 colors/finishes and their cost:</p>
<ul><li>Silver, Black: $349</li><li>Brushed Silver, Stealth: $399</li><li>Golf, Rose Gold: $499</li></ul>
<p>Itching for the Gold or Rose Gold Oura Ring 4? You&apos;ll be paying the most for those options. Silver and black are rather common options, which is likely why they cost the least, with Brushed Silver and Stealth sitting between these (just $50 more, but $100 less than the pricer options).</p><p>That said, no matter which color you choose, you&apos;ll end up with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> on the market, featuring an impressive all-titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/is-the-oura-ring-4-waterproof">waterproof build</a>.

The Oura Ring 4 is waterproof up to 100 meters or 330 feet, but there are more important details to remember. </p></article></section>
<h2 id="how-much-water-can-the-oura-ring-4-resist-2">How much water can the Oura Ring 4 resist?</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> is a good-looking wearable that you&apos;ll want to take everywhere you go, but can you? For example, you may want to go scuba diving, but there are some details you need to know before you head out with your flashy new Oura Ring 4.</p><p>Is the Oura Ring 4 waterproof? The smart ring is waterproof up to 100 meters or 330 feet. Oura confirms you can take it with you while swimming, showering, or participating in water activities such as snorkeling. However, due to the higher water pressure, the company does not recommend using it while scuba diving in depths greater than 100 meters or submerging it for over 12 hours.</p><p>The ring&apos;s operating temperature is between -10 Celsius and 52 degrees Celsius, meaning you can take it with you to ice baths, hot tubs, showers, and even cryotherapy tanks. However, it&apos;s important to remember that you shouldn&apos;t expose the ring to these activities for too long. You should also avoid exposing the Oura Ring to any scenarios where it&apos;s exposed to extreme pressure since it can also affect the smart ring&apos;s water resistance.</p><p>Repeated drops and poor maintenance are factors that can degrade your ring&apos;s water resistance. Oura provides some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402031939475-Caring-for-Your-Oura-Ring" target="_blank">fantastic tips</a> on caring for your smart ring and expanding its lifespan. For example, Oura recommends cleaning the sensors approximately once a week with either mild dish soap and water or wiping the ring with a piece of cloth or your T-shirt.</p><p>Another helpful tip is to wear your Oura Ring on your non-dominant hand. Using your less dominant hand reduces contact with objects that collide with your Oura Ring 4. You can also avoid using rings adjacent to the Oura Ring 4 and prevent scratching as you move your fingers.</p><p>It&apos;s also essential to avoid exposing your Oura Ring 4 to harsh chemicals, such as cleaning products, sunscreen, lotions, and other chemicals that can weaken the watertight seals. If you expose it to water or any chemicals, dry it immediately to avoid permanent damage. So, when it&apos;s cleaning time at home, it&apos;s best to put the ring in a safe place. Therefore, even though Oura says you can expose your ring to specific temperatures, it would be best not to since it contributes to your smart ring&apos;s water resistance lasting longer.</p><p>The Oura Ring 4 has the same rating as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>; it can be submerged for 100 meters.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max comes with the usual set of upgrades that we expect from Apple: it is faster in daily use, has better cameras, and the battery life is better than its predecessor. But there are other changes this year, notably around the screen. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch panel, but it isn&apos;t that much bigger than its predecessor.</p><p>The increased screen size means you get an additional line of text, and the bezels are even thinner this generation. There&apos;s also a new Camera Control button that unlocks additional controls and makes it easy to shoot photos and videos. While I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">initially excited about the hardware button</a>, it was unwieldy to use in the two weeks I tested the iPhone 16 Pro Max — it should have been integrated into the power button, similar to what ASUS did on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a> last year.</p><p>While there&apos;s plenty of new stuff on the phone, there&apos;s a glaring omission: Apple Intelligence. Apple&apos;s much-touted AI features won&apos;t be available until early 2025, and that puts the iPhone 16 Pro Max in an awkward position; the hardware itself is an iterative upgrade over last year, and you&apos;ll need to wait at least three months to unlock what is arguably its best feature.</p><p>So should you wait until next year to buy the iPhone 16 Pro Max? Let&apos;s take a look.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max made its official debut on September 9, and the phone went on sale globally on September 20. Similar to last year, the base model has 256GB of storage, and it is available in 512GB and 1TB variants as well — I&apos;m using the 512GB model.</p><p>In a positive move, Apple is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max at the same price as last year&apos;s models, and this is true not just in the U.S., but also key global markets like the U.K. and Germany. This is what the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs in various regions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB):</strong> $1,199 / £1,199 / €1,449 / ₹1,44,900</li><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (512GB):</strong> $1,399 / £1,399 / €1,699 / ₹1,64,900</li><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (1TB): </strong>$1,599 / £1,599 / €1,949 / ₹1,84,900</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is more affordable than its predecessor in India, and that&apos;s a great move by Apple. The brand is seeing sizeable momentum in the country, and each variant of the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs roughly $178 less this year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w63feHSnHDcojSGuUD5xQ" name="iphone-16-pro-max-1.jpg" alt="Back view of iPhone 16 Pro Max against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w63feHSnHDcojSGuUD5xQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple didn&apos;t change the design of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the phone looks identical to its predecessor. The only way to tell both phones apart is that the latest device is taller and wider than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, but other than that, they share the same design.</p><p>That means you get a titanium mid-frame with a glass front and back, and the glass protection is touted to be even better this year. While I tend to test the effectiveness of these claims with Android phones (inadvertently, most of the time), I wasn&apos;t willing to risk that with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I put it in a case shortly after setting it up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="thiPfamgYcLDGJKVcbwKy4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-11.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max metal sides" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thiPfamgYcLDGJKVcbwKy4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has the same flat sides with rounded edges, and the beveled sides make it easier to use than previous years. The build quality is predictably great, and while this isn&apos;t a brand-new design, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is immediately recognizable. The phone retains IP68 dust and water resistance, and like last year, it can be submerged in up to 6 meters of water — most Android phones are only rated at up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gxY5SbV74pEEWQUjYEu563" name="iphone-16-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max angled view highlighting logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gxY5SbV74pEEWQUjYEu563.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the design itself hasn&apos;t changed, the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in an interesting Desert Titanium color option, and this is the variant I&apos;m using. Apple switched out the Blue Titanium model of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new color option, and it looks terrific. The subtle gold hue looks great on the frosted glass back, and the color-matched camera rings and mid-frame give the phone a distinct character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U4rPVcQ7Vu75kqfLLuLJi3" name="iphone-16-pro-max-6.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view showcasing camera modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4rPVcQ7Vu75kqfLLuLJi3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don&apos;t like the color, you can pick up the device in White Titanium, Black Titanium, and Natural Titanium options instead. The camera housing has the same distinctive design as previous years, and is slightly raised; thankfully, there are no issues with usability.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is 4.1mm taller and 0.9mm wider than its predecessor, and the increased dimensions make it a bit unwieldy to use one-handed. It is taller than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z60-ultra-review">Nubia Z60 Ultra</a> dwarfs the iPhone 16 Pro Max in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-9.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with power button and Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A major highlight this year is the introduction of Camera Control, a button that sits to the right. It is an intriguing addition in that not many brands provide hardware controls for the camera, and it is versatile: you can use it to take photos with a short press, and a long press switches to video. The best feature is the ability to adjust zoom level by sliding your finger across the capacitive button, and a double tap allows you to unlock additional controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-10.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Control button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pMexFshkZtjCt7RQHyvto4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the idea is undoubtedly novel, the button is in a non-optimal location. It&apos;s awkward to access, and while adjusting the zoom level isn&apos;t that much of a hassle, it was always a bother to switch to other controls. Then there&apos;s the fact that video recording is only enabled as long as you press down on the button. After a week of use, I realized it was easier to just use the settings on the viewfinder to change controls than rely on the button. I also inadvertently pressed the button whenever picking up the phone off a table, and that was irksome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fQgnkaDhArev4zxRqaK946" name="iphone-16-pro-max-8.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with volume buttons and Action Button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQgnkaDhArev4zxRqaK946.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The left side of the frame contains the usual options: volume up and down, and the Action Button that debuted last year. The SIM card tray sits to the left as well, and you get the ability to slot in a physical SIM alongside an eSIM — if you&apos;re outside the U.S. USB-C charging is intact, and it makes using the iPhone 16 Pro Max that much easier. I wrote about how the switch to USB-C last year allowed me to use the iPhone 15 Pro Max a lot longer than I usually would, and that&apos;s true this year as well.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-display"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="R7Bo4K4RuQT8tFDCS4n8a4" name="iphone-16-pro-max-13.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7Bo4K4RuQT8tFDCS4n8a4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After four years of using 6.7-inch panels, Apple is increasing the screen size in the Pro Max series to 6.9 inches. The size difference is immediately evident when using the iPhone 16 Pro Max next to its predecessor, and what I like the most about is that the phone itself isn&apos;t noticeably bigger; Apple achieved this by trimming the bezels, and the overall effect is quite striking.</p>
<p>In real-world use, that means you get an additional line of text when browsing. The OLED panel itself is one of the best on any phone today; it has ProMotion tech — dynamic 120Hz refresh — along with HDR10 and Dolby Vision. The resolution is slightly higher at 2868 x 1320, but the pixel density is the same as last year, and the Ceramic Shield protection delivers 50% increased resilience against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPc5MmDPQSfvnwrSR3y758" name="iphone-16-pro-max-19.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Dynamic Island highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPc5MmDPQSfvnwrSR3y758.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, this is one of the best screens available today, and that&apos;s evident when streaming HDR content or playing games. You get vibrant colors with excellent contrast, and while there isn&apos;t as much customizability when it comes to color tonality, True Tone automatically tweaks color balance based on ambient light, and it does a good job in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD" name="iphone-16-pro-max-20.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jAbTLUkofY6oM9xkicnETD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t see any issues with brightness levels either, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max is among the best in this area as well. That said, the Pixel 9 Pro XL got noticeably brighter in outdoor use, and Google somehow managed to outdo every other brand this year. </p><p>Dynamic Island is unchanged from last year, and while the pill-sized cutout is bigger than what you get with Android devices, it isn&apos;t as unsightly as the previous notch. The ability to use this area for actionable things like music control and navigation alerts is still great, and while Android brands have tried to emulate it, no one came close.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-performance"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Performance</span></h2>

<p>Apple is in a unique position in that it controls both the hardware and software stacks, and that gives it greater freedom when it comes to delivering the best possible performance. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro, and it brings considerable upgrades — it has 20% greater efficiency under similar workloads as the A17 Pro, increased memory bandwidth, a 16-core neural engine that&apos;s more efficient than last year, and 2x gains in ray tracing.</p><p>As you&apos;d imagine, there are no issues in daily use; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is one of the fastest phones around, and that is noticeable when playing demanding titles. I didn&apos;t see any slowdowns or lag whatsoever, and overheating wasn&apos;t a problem during marathon gaming sessions.</p>

<p>While there are gains around ray tracing, rasterization is in line with last year, with the phone delivering similar scores in 3DMark&apos;s Wild Life Extreme as its predecessor — this has allowed Qualcomm to take the lead in this area. That said, the phone has the best single- and multi-core results of any device, and that&apos;s unlikely to change.</p>
<p>The base model of the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes with 256GB of storage, and you can pick up the phone in 512GB and 1TB variants as well, with all three models featuring 8GB of RAM as standard — just like last year.</p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing on the connectivity front either, with the phone offering Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (in select regions), and a second-gen UWM module. The USB-C charging port uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard and has the full 10Gbps bandwidth, and the best part is that it includes DisplayPort, giving you the ability to connect the phone to XR glasses like the RayNeo Air 2S and external monitors.</p><p>Similar to previous years, the vibration motor continues to be one of the best of any device, offering granular feedback when using the keyboard, navigating the interface, and other system events.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a bigger 4685mAh battery, and you get noticeable gains in daily use. I got an hour and a half of additional screen-time versus the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and that&apos;s a sizeable achievement in and of itself. The phone lasts a day even with heavy use, and most of the time, I averaged a day and a half between charges.</p><p>The charging situation is where things aren&apos;t any better. The iPhone 16 Pro Max takes an agonizing amount of time to charge, and while it gets to 45% in 30 minutes, it takes an additional 80 minutes to charge the battery entirely. While the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S24 Ultra don&apos;t have fast charging either, these devices don&apos;t take anywhere as long to charge, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max continues to lag behind its rivals.</p><p>Chinese brands are in a league of their own in this area, with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and Vivo X100 Ultra taking under 45 minutes to charge their batteries. That said, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has an advantage with wireless charging, with MagSafe now going up to 25W. The phone also works with the Qi2 standard — something Android phones haven&apos;t gotten around to yet — and you can get 15W charging via a Qi2 stand.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn&apos;t have drastically different camera hardware, with the phone using a similar 48MP main camera with sensor-shift OIS as last year. The 12MP telephoto lens is unchanged as well, and it delivers 5x optical zoom and OIS. There&apos;s now a 48MP wide-angle lens, and up front is a 12MP lens with OIS.</p><p>Camera Control is a key hardware addition this time, and while it is good to quickly pull up the camera and take a photo, the button isn&apos;t in the best location, and it isn&apos;t intuitive to use. After trying out the button for a week, I went back to adjusting viewfinder controls the usual way.</p><p>What you&apos;ll like better is the overhauled Photographic Styles, which now allows you to drastically change the look and feel of a photo. There are 15 preset tones you can use out of the box, but where the feature truly comes into its own is the ability to tweak these presets to your liking by changing the undertones and contrast selection. The result is that you get wildly different photos by switching up the tones, and there is extensive customizability in this regard.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve always enjoyed shooting macros with iPhones, and the 16 Pro Max lets you take high-res macro shots. Video is an area where the phone continues to dominate, and this year, you can shoot 4K in 120fps with HDR, and that&apos;s just incredible. The new ISP encoder able to handle the increased bandwidth, and what I like the most about this feature is that you can slow down footage to 60fps or 30fps after the fact via the built-in editor.</p><p>You can also record spatial audio, and it is enabled by default. What&apos;s cool about this feature is that you can then reduce background noise, or create a cinematic effect with ambient noises pushed to the background. You can do this by selecting Audio Mix in the editor, and it works incredibly well.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max doesn&apos;t deviate too much from its predecessor when it comes to color rendition, with resultant daylight shots having good white balance and color accuracy. You don&apos;t get saturated photos like Samsung&apos;s phones or the contrast-rich images that are a characteristic of Pixels. The phone does just as good a job in low-light conditions, but it is a bit aggressive with smoothening details. That said, the new Styles give you incredible customizability with tonal balance, and you can easily change the look of your photos. </p><p>The wide-angle lens is similarly great, and it doubles as a macro shooter, giving you the ability to take close-up shots. There is some noise in low-light shots taken with the wide-angle lens, and while it has good color rendition, it doesn&apos;t measure up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> in this regard.</p><p>The zoom lens is relatively unchanged, and it manages to deliver clean shots at up to 5x. You get usable photos at 10x as well, but there&apos;s visible noise — more so than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Portraits are similarly great, and you get good background segmentation. That said, they&apos;re nowhere as detailed as the Vivo X100 Ultra or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>; these two devices still have a distinct edge when it comes to portrait shots.</p><p>Overall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does a better job than its predecessor, and it holds up incredibly well against the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Vivo&apos;s X100 Pro and X100 Ultra and the Find X7 Ultra are much better in low-light situations and portrait shots, but as an all-round package, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does more than enough to stand out against its rivals.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H8ktpvXwg9QY4xEKV9yEg8" name="iphone-16-pro-max-22.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H8ktpvXwg9QY4xEKV9yEg8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple introduced a ton of new features in iOS 18, but not all are available out of the box — all the AI-focused features will debut at a later time. There&apos;s an increased focus on customization this time, and much-needed updates to a lot of the stock apps. A big update includes RCS integration in Messages, something that took a long time to arrive. You get to use emoji or stickers with Tapback, the ability to schedule messages, and so much more, and while I don&apos;t use iMessage, it clearly has a lot going for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jMYJeCPxqyiyHiRp2f6aW9" name="iphone-16-pro-max-25.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max extended Control Center details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jMYJeCPxqyiyHiRp2f6aW9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Control Center has much better customizability, and you can easily add and change toggles as needed. It has scrollable pages, and if you need additional widgets that don&apos;t fit into the default pane, you can set up additional ones according to your preferences. I didn&apos;t get much utility out of this feature as I like to limit the number of toggles I use, and most of my interactions are focused on the media player.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC" name="iphone-16-pro-max-28.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max tinted icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can now change icon size and choose between various styling options. There&apos;s the default light and dark, and automatic modes, and the tinted option in particular is interesting, as it gives you granular control in tweaking the colors of the icon. Unlike Google&apos;s Themed icons (which is still in beta), the iOS 18 implementation is consistent across all apps, and it works incredibly well. You can change lock screen controls as well, switching out the flashlight and camera toggles with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JHgnkPjNYtf9AGJXEMAZy9" name="iphone-16-pro-max-26.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHgnkPjNYtf9AGJXEMAZy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, you get the ability to leave blank spaces between app icons on the home screen — something that was long overdue. The default Photos app has been overhauled and now uses collections-based sorting to organize your photos and videos, and you get better control in arranging your media library. iOS 18 also gives you the option to hide and lock apps behind Face ID, which is ideal with financial utilities or messaging clients.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iTPz5yqj256K6tLk9ugDVA" name="iphone-16-pro-max-27.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max extended Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTPz5yqj256K6tLk9ugDVA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Apple Intelligence is a key addition to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and you get a suite of AI-enabled features around writing, image generation, and so much more. However, Apple Intelligence isn&apos;t available at the moment, and the initial set of AI features will go live starting October 28 in the U.S. with the iOS 18.1 update.</p><p>Customers in other countries have a lengthier wait, and not all features showcased at the launch event will be accessible immediately; there&apos;s going to be a staggered availability instead, and you&apos;ll need to wait until end of Q1 to get most of the AI features.</p><p>This is a unique situation; Apple usually has all of its features available on launch day, but because of the scale of the undertaking, the brand is taking its time — and that&apos;s something I can get behind. Most brands have been too hasty to introduce AI features, and they&apos;re half-baked at best. Having said that, you&apos;ll need to wait several months to unlock the full potential of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-the-competition"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB" name="iphone-16-pro-max-30.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiQzkBM5cbAGgGccwEM6CB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is the obvious alternative to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It feels like Google went out of its way to make the 9 Pro XL look like an iPhone, and it does a good job in that regard. You still get a distinctive camera housing at the back, but the flat sides and chunkier design makes it feel like an iPhone in everyday use. The 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware, but it has an OLED panel that gets brighter, outstanding cameras, and the best AI features of any phone available today.</p><p>If you need a phone with plenty of power, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a good choice to consider as well. The software isn&apos;t as good as what you get on the Pixel — or the iPhone 16 Pro Max — but you get seven years of updates, and Samsung bundles a decent set of AI tools with Galaxy AI.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uEvqz8uoPtbpCCzWVmprB7" name="iphone-16-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view against gold-colored background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEvqz8uoPtbpCCzWVmprB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an iPhone with a sizeable OLED panel</li><li>You want the best hardware on a phone</li><li>You need standout cameras</li><li>You want better battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest AI features</li><li>You need the best charging tech</li><li>You have an iPhone 15 Pro Max</li></ul>
<p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a great phone that promises to get even better when Apple Intelligence becomes available. You don&apos;t need to wait until the AI features roll out if you&apos;re looking to upgrade from an older iPhone; there are enough new features to distinguish it from its predecessors. The most noticeable difference is the bigger OLED panel, and while it makes the phone even taller, it is a welcome upgrade.</p><p>But what you&apos;ll actually end up liking is the battery longevity; the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts significantly longer than its predecessor, and that in itself is enough of an upgrade to entice older iPhone users to make the switch. Other battery-related tweaks should curb battery degradation — something that was a major issue on the iPhone 14 series — and while the charging situation is in need of an overhaul, 25W MagSafe is a decent workaround in the meantime.</p><p>There&apos;s little incentive to move if you&apos;re already using the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but if you&apos;re on an older device and are mulling an upgrade, you should get the iPhone 16 Pro Max. </p>
