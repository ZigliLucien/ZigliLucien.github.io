<hr>
<p>Motorola just launched its new Edge (2024) midrange device today (June 4), built to "empower" consumers on a daily basis.</p><p>According to its press release, the Motorola Edge (2024) offers a 6.6-inch pOLED endless edge display with a quick 144Hz refresh rate. Motorola has continued to feature a 360Hz refresh touch rate on its new Edge to ensure users experience a fast, responsive phone.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-motorola-edge-gen-4/p?skuId=1001">its 2022 iteration</a>, the Moto Edge offers a raised, rectangular dual-camera array. The post highlights a 50MP primary lens that leverages Sony&apos;s LYT-700C imaging sensor with f/1.8 aperture. Joining it will be a 13MP ultra-wide lens able to achieve a 120-degree field-of-view. The front-facing camera comes in at 32MP with auto-focus (AF).</p><p>Motorola explains that its rear camera offers several features such as Panorama, Night Vision, Dual Capture, Ultra-res, and more. Other capabilities, courtesy of AI software, include Google Auto Enhance, Auto Smile Capture, and Google Lens integration, among others.</p><p>For video capture, the 50MP primary lens can capture your memories at 4K UHD quality at 30fps. Swapping to FHD will award you 60fps capture, alongside an option for 30fps.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s midrange Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 SoC will power the 2024 Moto Edge&apos;s capabilities.</p>

<p>Feature-wise, Motorola states the 2024 Edge delivers a new "Quick Button" on the side of the device. The purpose is so users can launch their favorite apps quickly without much hassle, as well as an "app-specific action." Motorola adds users can attach a messaging app, social media app, or anything else to this new Quick Button for easy access.</p><p>Carrying you throughout the day will be the Edge&apos;s 5,000mAh battery, which is a notable upgrade from the 4,400mAh battery that the 2023 iteration offers. Paired with this is 68W wired TurboPower charging. Motorola states this technology will give consumers around 50% in just 15 minutes. Additionally, there&apos;s a 15W wireless charging option.</p><p>The post states the Moto Edge 2024 contains 256GB of internal storage and RAM Boost for turning unused storage into "virtual" RAM.</p>

<p>The phone has an IP68 rating for dust, dirt, and sand resistance. Motorola&apos;s Edge can survive for nearly thirty minutes when submerged in 1.5 meters of water. Moreover, the device (back panel) is featured in Midnight Blue vegan leather for a premium feel without breaking the bank.</p><p>Motorola states that the 2024 Edge will be available on June 20 for $549. Consumers can find it in the U.S. at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola.com. Networks like T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Spectrum, Consumer Cellular, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, and Visible will also carry the device.</p><p>Those in Canada can expect to find the Moto Edge 2024 "in the coming months."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is suing Oura in U.S. District Court to forestall any patent claims against the Samsung Galaxy Ring. </li><li>Oura has previously sued Circular, RingConn, and Ultrahuman for patent infringement and owns over 100 smart ring patents.</li><li>Samsung claims its Galaxy Ring doesn't infringe on Oura's patents and is seeking legal confirmation before its August release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>On May 30, Samsung lawyers filed a lawsuit in the San Francisco Division District Court against Oura Health Oy, asking for a declaratory judgment and jury trial. Why? Because they think Oura will sue Samsung over the Galaxy Ring — just like it sued three other smart ring makers — and want to establish legal innocence before the smart ring goes on sale.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.430276/gov.uscourts.cand.430276.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">lawsuit documents</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170479/samsung-galaxy-ring-oura-lawsuit-smart-ring-patents" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) reveal that Samsung intends to send the Galaxy Ring into mass production in "mid-June 2024" and will open smart ring sales "in or around August 2024." Samsung has long hinted at a summer Galaxy Unpacked reveal, but this is the first <em>official</em> confirmation.</p><p>Samsung claims that "Oura&apos;s pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market" is an "actual, imminent risk to Samsung" and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>&apos;s chances of success.</p><p>The filing then runs through Oura&apos;s history of suing three other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-smart-rings-work">smart ring</a> makers over alleged patent infringement: Circular, Ultrahuman, and RingConn. In one case, Oura "alleged infringement by Circular and then filed suit against Circular before obtaining a sample of the Circular Ring," months before it went on sale. Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-files-itc-action-for-patent-infringement/" target="_blank">filed a joint ITC action against these three brands</a> in March 2024, and the case is ongoing. </p><p>Samsung fears Oura might target them next in the lead-up to the August launch, triggering bad press and stalled sales for a major new product. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n49FsjAiP2HJctX4nA25qE" name="Samsung Galaxy Ring trio.jpg" alt="A trio of Samsung Galaxy Rings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n49FsjAiP2HJctX4nA25qE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The upcoming Samsung Galaxy Ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Samsung first announced the Galaxy Ring, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-responds-galaxy-ring-announcement">Oura responded</a> by touting its "strongest IP portfolio—in both hardware and software—for the smart ring form factor, with 100 granted patents, 270 pending patent applications, and 130+ registered trademarks." </p><p>Samsung references this announcement directly in the lawsuit, along with several interviews where Oura CEO Tom Hale repeatedly mentioned his company&apos;s readiness to "defend [its] intellectual property" and praised Masimo, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/masimo-ceo-claims-the-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensors-are-inaccurate-and-that-users-will-be-better-off-without-them">sued Apple over its SpO2 technology</a> and argued for an Apple Watch ban. </p><p>The rest of the lawsuit walks a delicate line. Samsung first states that Oura sues companies over "features common to virtually all smart rings, such as the inclusion of sensors, electronics, and batteries." Despite this, Samsung then claims that "the Galaxy Ring has not infringed, and does not infringe, directly or indirectly, any valid and enforceable claim" from Oura&apos;s five most commonly cited patents in its previous lawsuits.</p><p>To summarize, Samsung thinks it&apos;s unfair for Oura to weaponize smart ring patents for fundamental features. At the same time, Samsung argues that its unique Galaxy Ring designs are distinct enough from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring (Gen 3)</a> that Oura can&apos;t claim they&apos;re stolen. </p><p>We don&apos;t expect this lawsuit to be resolved before the August Galaxy Ring launch, but the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the future of smart ring competition. </p>
<h2 id="the-samsung-vs-oura-legal-battle-isn-apos-t-just-about-the-galaxy-ring-2">The Samsung vs. Oura legal battle isn&apos;t just about the Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p>Back in January, I wrote a column listing the reasons <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-has-huge-potential-but-also-huge-roadblocks">why the Galaxy Ring is exciting, and why it might fail</a>. One key roadblock to its success? As I said then, Oura was "weaponizing its patents" against smart ring makers; I argued that "Oura&apos;s lawyers are poised to strike if Samsung comes anywhere close to its hundreds of patented smart ring designs."</p><p>I&apos;d say, "I&apos;d told you so," but I won&apos;t claim to be some prescient tech oracle. I didn&apos;t need to watch Oura&apos;s CEO bring up IP over and over to know what was coming. Its legal history made it plain that Oura didn&apos;t intend to let Samsung encroach on its territory, even if it <em>claimed</em> that "new players" like Samsung provided "validation" for smart rings.</p><p>I expected Oura to launch its patent salvo first; I didn&apos;t realize that Samsung&apos;s legal team wouldn&apos;t leave anything to chance. </p><p>Still, I find the Samsung vs. Oura smart ring battle fascinating. Samsung is a Goliath of the tech world and the furthest thing from an underdog. But in the smart ring space, Oura is trying to knock out competitors one by one as they arise, like a litigious game of Whack-a-Mole. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3718px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="u2spFUWezzbN2fh3YLtEwE" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-phone-app-1.jpg" alt="Oura Ring (Gen 3) on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u2spFUWezzbN2fh3YLtEwE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3718" height="2091" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung convinces the U.S. District Court that it hasn&apos;t infringed on Oura, then it has the resources to become a major player in the smart ring space — if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-working-on-supporting-galaxy-ring-on-non-galaxy-phones">only for Android users</a>. More importantly (to me), this case could establish a precedent for other smart ring brands (with less robust legal teams) to argue that Oura&apos;s patents shouldn&apos;t apply to them, either.</p><p>If Oura beats Samsung, I wonder whether companies would see that as a sign to give up on smart ring development since Oura&apos;s hundreds of patents would preclude a smart ring design that <em>doesn&apos;t</em> infringe on their IP. </p><p>I don&apos;t want to vilify Oura for having the foresight to patent universal smart ring ideas before its rivals. It&apos;s not a "patent troll," but rather someone actually putting its ideas into practice with a popular consumer product. The legal merit should depend on whether Samsung infringed on Oura, not Oura&apos;s ruthless legal strategy. </p><p>But that doesn&apos;t change the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">smart rings will remain niche</a> if only one company can legally make them with core smart features. Monopolies don&apos;t typically lead to innovation.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Leaked images reveal a significant design shift for the Galaxy Z Fold 6, moving away from curved edges to a flatter, sharper look.</li><li>The phone is rumored to have a wider cover screen and potentially wider overall dimensions when unfolded.</li><li>The internal display bezels might be squared off to match the new design.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Anticipation for the next iteration of Samsung&apos;s book-style foldable flagship, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, grows as a purported dummy unit surfaces online, offering a better look at its design.</p><p>Leaked images have surfaced on X, courtesy of @ta__tech, showing a dummy unit of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-dummy-unit-boxy-design/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Found in a Korean Forum, apparently this is the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The squared edges make a word of difference and the slightly shorter but wider inner screen makes it look different to Fold 5. pic.twitter.com/v8LPICeRRn<a href="https://twitter.com/ta__tech/status/1795678064875028514">May 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>These mock phones, often called "dummy units," are sent out to accessory companies before the real product launches to help them ensure their cases will fit the new phone perfectly.</p><p>Samsung has been tweaking the design of its Galaxy Z Fold phones for years, but it looks like the next one is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-z-fold-6-leak-reveals-the-foldable-from-the-front">ditching the curves for a flatter, sharper look</a>.</p><p>A cursory examination of the new leak reveals a striking departure from the Galaxy Z Fold series&apos; established design paradigm. The previously ubiquitous rounded corners may be replaced with a decidedly angular aesthetic, hinting at a potential shift towards a more modern and assertive stylistic direction.</p>

<p>These leaked images aren&apos;t showing a perfect right angle; there&apos;s still a bit of a curve. But it&apos;s definitely sharper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5">Z Fold 5</a>&apos;s corners. It looks like earlier rumors about a boxier Z Fold 6 were right on the money.</p><p>Beyond the aforementioned angular shift, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">noteworthy design alteration appears to be implemented in the cover screen</a>. As per the leak, the cover screen appears to be wider and looks like a regular phone screen when folded. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> usually have tall and skinny cover screens, but the Z Fold 6 might be changing that.</p><p>The internal screen isn&apos;t escaping the makeover either. The leak suggests the sides are getting squared off to match the new design, and it might be wider and shorter overall. This makes sense considering rumors say the unfolded phone will be 153.5mm x 132.5mm.</p><p>The dummy unit doesn&apos;t even try to hide the crease down the middle, which is pretty much a given for foldable phones.</p><p>Intriguingly, the hinge mechanism appears remarkably inconspicuous in the leaked imagery. This suggests that Samsung might have shrunk it down, which could make the whole phone look sleeker.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is rumored to launch alongside the Z Flip 6 and maybe even a new wearable device called the Galaxy Ring at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-event-date-rumored">Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked event on July 10</a>. That&apos;s when we should get all the official details on these new devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus isn&apos;t expected to debut its next flagship phone for a while, but that&apos;s not stopping these rumors from speculating on what we might see.</p><p>Rumors stem from notable Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OgG18rs6V?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo, which states the OnePlus 13 could miss out on wireless charging (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/06/oneplus-13-may-not-include-wireless-charging-details-tipped.html">Android Headlines</a>). The device may sport a 6,000mAh battery, backed by 100W wired charging. Additionally, as previously rumored, the OnePlus 13 will likely gain strength from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4-power-hungry-rumor">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>.</p><p>The leaks continue as DCS posted another set of rumors about the device&apos;s supposed camera and display specification, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/06/03/oneplus-13-display-battery-leak/">Gizmochina</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 will supposedly feature an "upgraded" 50MP periscope triple camera setup. The tipster didn&apos;t suggest what the other two lenses would be. Additionally, the phone is rumored to offer a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display.</p><p>The post explains that the display will be almost entirely flat as OnePlus could place a "micro-curved" glass on top of it. Such changes might add to its "conventionally" large display size.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is a device that launched without any noticeable drawbacks. For context, the device offers a 6.8-inch LTPO AMOLED. However, one of its notable features, which the OnePlus 11 didn&apos;t have, was wireless charging. The 2024 flagship offered 100W wired charging alongside 50W wireless charging capabilities. It was one of the phone&apos;s highest talking points as OnePlus continued to hone its flagship craft.</p><p>Additionally, this year&apos;s launch only offers a 5,400mAh battery, so that&apos;s another improvement aside from its display and camera changes.</p><p>In March, the OnePlus 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">was rumored</a> to feature a design change and an upgraded fingerprint sensor. Those whispers suggested there could be a change to its "hinge," which was a reference to the phone&apos;s camera visor as it flows off to the side of its frame. Doubling down on that rumor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-oneplus-13r-likely-to-look-different-in-design">was a leak in May</a> that supposedly contained a mock-up of its supposed design changes.</p><p>Speculation states the OnePlus 13 could have its circular camera array moved to the center of its back panel instead of on its side. Moreover, the OnePlus 13R could separate from the pack and offer a side-mounted squarish array.</p><p>Recent rumors have suggested that OnePlus could launch its next flagship phone late this year.</p>

<p>Meta Connect 2024 will take place on September 25–26, Mark Zuckerberg revealed in a brief <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/zuck/3382402766048980457?utm_source=ig_story_item_share&igsh=NnRtMmZ4YWQxN2U3" target="_blank">Instagram story</a> on Monday. Meta&apos;s social media accounts promise that Connect 2024 will "explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse."</p><p>We won&apos;t know more about the Connect 2024 itinerary for months. That being said, Meta&apos;s PR team prioritizing AI before XR feels like an intentional choice. After Google covered two straight hours of AI at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, Meta might take a similar approach this fall, showing off how its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3</a> models have evolved.</p><p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">you&apos;re sick of AI</a>, that won&apos;t sound appealing. But unlike Google, Meta should counterbalance its AI push with plenty of hardware announcements to keep consumers invested.</p><p>Months of leaks have us confident that Zuckerberg will unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Meta Quest 3s (or Quest Lite)</a> on stage at Meta Connect 2024, just as he revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> at Connect 2023. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🗓️ Mark your calendars 🗓️ Meta Connect 2024 will be September 25 + 26 where we'll explore the future of AI and mixed reality and share progress on our long-term vision to help build the metaverse.<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaNewsroom/status/1797709393989140935">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3s is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-meta-quest-3s-looks-like-quest-2-with-new-brain-and-eyeballs">rumored</a> to have the Quest 3&apos;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and RGB cameras for full-color XR passthrough, but the thicker Quest 2 lenses with lower display resolution — all to target an alleged $299 price tag that&apos;ll appeal to budget buyers. </p><p>Meta announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">open-source Horizon OS</a> earlier this year, with partners like ASUS ROG and Lenovo promising to make their own VR headsets. So it&apos;s <em>possible</em> they could join the stage at Connect to exhibit their new hardware — though we suspect Meta wouldn&apos;t want these companies to steal the Quest 3s&apos; thunder. </p>

<p>In addition, we&apos;ve heard credible reports that Meta intends to show off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-will-reportedly-showcase-prototype-ar-glasses-at-connect-2024">Orion AR glasses prototype at Connect 2024</a>. Allegedly, there is "internal pressure to ensure a high level of performance" with this prototype when it&apos;s first shown off to the public. </p><p>Caitlin Kalinowski, Meta&apos;s Head of AR Glasses Hardware, told us in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">exclusive interview</a> that they&apos;re working on AR glasses with "high field-of-view immersion" that will, in her words, trigger the same "Oh my God, WOW! I can&apos;t believe this" reactions as the original Oculus Rift when it first introduced a ton of people to VR. </p>
<p>While Meta&apos;s AR glasses won&apos;t be consumer-ready for years, Meta Connect 2024 attendees might have the chance to try the first-ever public prototype. In the meantime, Meta will probably spend time focusing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a>, which recently got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">major multimodal AI upgrade</a>.</p><p>Last year&apos;s event took place on Meta&apos;s campus in Menlo Park, California, while pre-pandemic Connects took place at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. We&apos;ll find out later this year where to expect this next event, but non-Californians should be able to stream the keynote via Facebook or YouTube. </p>

<hr>
<p>Slowly but surely, more information about the Pixel 9 series is coming to light, and the latest leaks involve Google&apos;s 2024 chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rozetked.me/news/33532-eksklyuziv-rezul-taty-testov-pixel-9-9-pro-i-9-pro-xl">Rozetked </a>(Russian) spotted the Pixel 9 trio undergoing the hurdles of the AnTuTu benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-scores/">Android Police</a>). Running the Tensor G4, the base Pixel 9 scored 1.07 million points. The middle Pixel 9 Pro achieved 1.14 million points, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL reached 1.17 million points.</p><p>As the publication notes, these numbers ma]\y seem high, but they&apos;re only slightly higher than the base Pixel 8 at 900,000. This is likely due to Google&apos;s minimal changes, as the Tensor G4 features an ARMv9-A core architecture.</p><p>Simply put, the chip offers one Cortex-A4 at 3.1GHz, three Cortex-A720 cores at 2.6GHz, and four Cortex-A520 cores at 1.95GHz.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t seem like we&apos;re in for a <em>major </em>power boost for the Pixel series with the Tensor G4. However, it&apos;s worth noting that these early test numbers aren&apos;t indicative of the Pixel 9&apos;s final release strength.</p><p>Things could get better (or stay the same), so we&apos;ll have to wait until after the summer.</p>

<p>For context, last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Tensor G3</a> features one Cortex-X3 core clocked at 2.91 GHz, four Cortex-A715 performance cores (2.37 GHz), and four Cortex-A510 cores (1.7 GHz). Google&apos;s chip features one more core dedicated to efficiency, however, it fell short of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in terms of speed for its performance and prime cores. Moreover, the chip still gets warm pretty quickly and it&apos;s bad news for gamers as their FPS will continuously drop during long play sessions.</p><p>AI was what Google banked on — and there&apos;s no reason why that wouldn&apos;t continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">be the case this year</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s been rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-might-not-surprise">since last year</a> that the Tensor G4 might not be a major powerhouse over the G3. The chip is supposedly using the codename "Zuma Pro," which builds upon the G3&apos;s "Zuma" name. Speculation pointed toward a more minimal upgrade as Google reportedly scrapped its entirely new processor, codename "Redondo," due to sharp delays.</p><p>Other reports stated the chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">will lean on Samsung&apos;s</a> third-generation SF4P 4nm process. This, again, is only <em>slightly </em>better than the Tensor G3&apos;s SF4 process. Elsewhere, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/entire-pixel-9-series-live-photos-specs-leak">entire Pixel 9 series</a> leaked in live photos just hours before Google&apos;s I/O 2024 keynote event in May.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new OnePlus tablet seems to be on the way, and a recent benchmark listing suggests it could be a high-end device, likely named the OnePlus Pad 2, featuring a flagship processor from Qualcomm.</p><p>According to a Geekbench listing, the OnePlus Pad 2 will be powered by Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chipset, the same processor that will likely power the OPPO Pad 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-pad-2-geekbench-snapdragon-8-gen-3/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>). This aligns with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-rumored-chipset">earlier leaks from Max Jambor</a>, which indicated the new tablet would sport Qualcomm’s latest and greatest chipset.</p><p>Given that OPPO and OnePlus are owned by the same parent company, they often share technology, making it reasonable to expect the OPPO Pad 3 and OnePlus Pad 2 to have identical specs.</p><p>The upcoming OnePlus tablet appeared on Geekbench with the model number OPD2404, while the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> had the OPD2203 model number. The new device scored 2,079 points in the single-core test and 6,077 points in the multi-core test, presumably thanks to the upgraded processor.</p><p>The original OnePlus Pad, launched last year, featured a MediaTek Dimensity 9000 chipset. While decent, using 2021 hardware for a 2023 tablet was unusual. The OnePlus Pad 2 could rectify this with a more modern and powerful chipset.</p><p>In addition to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, the benchmark listing reveals the tablet will have at least 8GB of RAM and will run Android 14 out of the box. This tablet is also expected to have a huge 9,510mAh battery, likely with fast charging support.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 marks a significant improvement over MediaTek&apos;s  Dimensity 9000, potentially leading to other exciting upgrades like switching from an LCD to an AMOLED panel—a staple of today&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">premium tablets</a>.</p><p>Although these enhancements might increase the OnePlus Pad 2’s price, the company could still offer strong value compared to Samsung’s tablets.</p>

Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep browsing," the feature&apos;s prompt reads.</p><p>The platform is only testing this feature for a handful of people, as none of Android Central&apos;s staff has experienced these disruptions on the app. </p><p>Until now, Instagram has shown ads in between posts or stories that users can simply scroll past. However, according to this Reddit thread, this unskippable ad situation has only been getting on users&apos; nerves. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1d52psw/ad_break_ie_unskippable_ads_now_on_instagram">“Ad Break” ie. unskippable ads now on Instagram</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram">r/Instagram</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>One user stated that these ads are definitely a business decision and that they would leave the platform if this continued. </p><p>"I hate this new "feature" so much - it is so in your face and to me, feels like a terrible business decision. The whole platform is already basically "soft ads" that generate revenue based on people being on there for ages, consuming content without thinking too much about it all and now they&apos;re forcing users to stop scrolling and drawing attention to the fact they&apos;re on an app designed to sell them things."</p><p>As a workaround, the user said they "simply close the app as soon as an ad break pops up, and if this continues, I&apos;ll be unsubscribing." </p><p>While other users on the same thread stated that they would "100% be quitting/uninstalling the app."</p><p>One good thing that could come out of this "Ad-break" is that it would give users a break from going down the Instagram rabbit hole for hours, leading to unwanted procrastination. </p>

<p>Instagram first introduced ads on its feed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tests-notes-profile-ads">back in 2022</a>, but it remains unclear when the social media company will roll out these ad breaks to more users.

<p>A lot of times when a new smartphone comes out, it&apos;s not a huge leap over its predecessor. This is especially true with midrange phones, as companies try to keep costs down by using cheaper parts and opting for older chipsets. With the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, Motorola may have borrowed the same chipset from its predecessor, but nearly everything else has changed to the point that you wouldn&apos;t know these phones are only a year apart.</p><p>So what does this mean for the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023? While its successor makes quite a leap, is the phone still worth buying for someone looking to save money on their next phone purchase? Lets take a look.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-vs-stylus-5g-2023-design-and-display-2">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 vs. Stylus 5G 2023: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4220px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dyr7qwifi4RZtZvSi5CP6a" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-vs-Stylus-5G-2023-09.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 next to the Stylus 5G 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyr7qwifi4RZtZvSi5CP6a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4220" height="2374" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to design, these two phones could not be any more different. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> features Motorola&apos;s new design language, moving away from typical plastic found on many cheap Android phones and instead going with vegan leather. It&apos;s really just a fancier, textured plastic, but it feels soft in the hand and keeps the phone from getting too warm or too cool. The phone also has a plastic frame, but you won&apos;t know that at first; it looks and feels like brushed aluminum, which adds to the rather premium look of the phone.</p><p>By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2023</a> looks a lot more conventional. The back is constructed with plastic but made to look like frosted glass, so the color sort of shifts a bit when light hits it. The back panel curves into the frame, which is also plastic.</p><p>However, the differences also extend to the front of these phones. The display on the 2024 model is a hair larger at 6.7 inches, but you wouldn&apos;t know it just from holding the phones side-by-side, as they&apos;re nearly the same size. That&apos;s because the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has much smaller bezels around its display, giving the phone more than a 93% screen-to-body ratio. With bezels this small, you&apos;d think this was a flagship phone, especially when compared to the 2023 model, which has much larger bezels and a more prominent chin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AkiDzAuj76mMoLrQaqtBRF" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-vs-Stylus-5G-2023-10.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 next to the Stylus 5G 2023 displaying the settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AkiDzAuj76mMoLrQaqtBRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display technology has also been upgraded between the phones. The 2024 model has moved to an OLED panel while retaining the 120Hz refresh rate and Motorola&apos;s flicker prevention feature—a staple for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive users</a>. Compared to the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023, this new display is punchier and much more vibrant. Contrast seems to be dialed up a bit, so you can lose some of the details in darker parts of content, but overall the screen quality is pretty good.</p><p>The 2023 model has a good display for an LCD panel, and while it doesn&apos;t get as punchy as the 2024 model, it still has decent color reproduction. That said, you may want to set the display to Saturated in the settings to give content a bit of a boost.</p><p>Meanwhile, both displays have 120Hz panels, so the navigation of content is as smooth as you can imagine. The Stylus 5G 2024 does have the benefit of an in-display fingerprint sensor which is impressive for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">Android phone under $400</a>. It works surprisingly well and about as quickly as the side-mounted sensor on the 2023 model. The only downside is that it&apos;s oddly placed on the display, quite close to the bottom.</p>

<p>Despite quite a few upgrades on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, the phone weights a little bit less than its predecessor at 190g. Still, at 202g, the 2023 model doesn&apos;t feel particularly heavy, but you may have to get used to how light the 2024 model feels in hand. I imagine this is due to the type of plastic used on the back, which feels more like a light fabric than anything.</p><p>For protection, the Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 misses out on an IP rating, but the 2024 model comes with IP52, which is fine for light splashes and the like. Just don&apos;t go swimming with either phone.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Motorola opted to keep the same chipset on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024. Normally, I would question this decision, but after using the phone, my concerns were quickly allayed. The performance of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> is spectacular and much better than I remember after using the 2023 model, which also performed quite well. The biggest difference here is likely the 8GB of RAM on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, two more than its predecessor, and likely giving the phone a nice boost when running apps.</p><p>That said, you won&apos;t really run into any issues with either phone, even when playing graphics-intensive games. Honkai Star: Rail runs quite well, even on the highest settings, although you may experience a little wonkiness on the 2023 model. Still, you&apos;ll be able to get through plenty of tasks without issue on these phones, but the extra RAM on the 2024 model is helpful.</p>

<p>Both phones come with Bluetooth 5.1, NFC, and 3.5mm headphone jacks. They also have dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support, and audio sounds great from both devices.</p><p>On the software side, the 2023 model was recently updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> at the time of writing, which is the only major OS upgrade the phone will receive. That said, the phone will continue to receive security updates roughly every other month for another two years, so there&apos;s that.</p><p>It&apos;s a similar story for the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024, although the phone runs Android 14 out of the box and will eventually get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. Motorola has added a number of new software tweaks with this version of Android 14, as the UI is somewhat different from that of the 2023 model. The differences on the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 include a new (optional) layout for the quick settings panel, AI-generated wallpapers, lock screen widgets, a new look for the Settings menu, and more. It&apos;s not a massive overhaul, but it&apos;s a much cleaner look and gives Motorola a bit more individuality.</p><p>The newer model also has features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> and Smart Connect, which is the rebranded version of Ready For. This allows the phone to connect to computers, TVs, and monitors for easily moving files, streaming apps on a larger display, browsing via a mobile desktop UI, and much more. Unfortunately, this is still not available on the 2023 model, and it&apos;s unsure why the UIs are so different between the phones.</p>

<p>Of course, both phones come with styli, but the 2024 model gets a redesign with a thicker body, making it look more like an S Pen. Motorola says it should have more contact area and improved software for better responsiveness, but overall, the experience between the two phones is roughly the same and nothing like you&apos;d find on an actual S Pen.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 5,000mAh battery, an attribute shared by both devices. You should be able to get through a day of use and perhaps even more, depending on your habits. Motorola improved the charging speed for the 2024 model, giving it 30W wired instead of 20W, making it faster than some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, although not as fast as some other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>. The phone even has wireless charging at 15W, something you don&apos;t often see at this price point (even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> only has 5W wireless charging).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G2AvfwPNRx3QWU969nmyWT" name="Moto-G-Stylus-5G-2024-vs-Stylus-5G-2023-4.jpg" alt="The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 next to the Stylus 5G 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G2AvfwPNRx3QWU969nmyWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones feature fairly similar camera setups, aside from the added resolution in the ultrawide sensor on the 2024 model. Still, image quality gets a huge boost thanks to OIS and PDAF on the primary sensor. As you can see from the images below, the 2024 model produces bright and detailed images, which have a level of crispness that images from the 2023 model lack.</p><p>Last year&apos;s Stylus tends to process images with more warmth, and the phone seems incapable of pulling in as much light, so details are lost a bit in darker areas, which the 2024 model is able to brighten up and highlight thanks to better dynamic range. I&apos;ve also noticed that images from the Stylus 5G 2024 are a bit truer to life, which I often prefer in images.</p>

<p>Neither phone has a telephoto lens, but you can see how the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is able to retain more detail in the statue and the building behind it at 2x zoom. Interestingly, this is where the Stylus 5G 2023 model produces a cooler image than the 2024 model; all the while, the Stylus 5G 2024 continues to have a more accurate representation of the scene.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=9e454ea4-1f8c-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The difference in detail becomes more apparent with low-light and nighttime images. In the photo of the boat on a river, you can better make out the ripples in the water and even some of the details of the trees in the background. On the 2023 model, the water looks quite muddy and there&apos;s virtually zero detail in anything on the other side of the river. White balance also seems slightly off and there&apos;s an unappealing green-ish tint on the boat.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=1af0635c-1f8e-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>In this final image, the Eiffel Tower is slightly blown out on the 2023 model, while the Stylus 5G 2024 manages to retain a good amount of detail. The image is also much more brighter on the newer phone without overdoing it and reigning in noise as much as possible. The clouds appear much more dramatic on the Stylus 5G 2023, but the rest of the image is rather dark.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=7718b2f4-1f90-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>The 2024 model also has a few extra features not found on its predecessor. One of these features is the Auto Enhance, which attempts to improve images by adding extra processing via Google Photos. This might have been useful on the Stylus 5G 2023 to help punch up image quality a bit, but I find that you can go without it on the newer model.</p>

<p>Motorola&apos;s Stylus models are some of the best value phones money can buy, short of the Pixel A-series. In 2023, I was pretty impressed with the Stylus 5G, but I never found myself particularly attached to it. That has changed with this newer model, as the phone feels like Motorola is teetering on the cusp of midrange and flagship.</p><p>Despite having the same chipset, the Moto G Stylus 5G brings more RAM, better cameras, a vibrant OLED display, wireless charging, and a better-designed stylus, making this phone a clear winner between it and its predecessor, especially when you can get it for the same launch price.</p><p>That said, if you&apos;re looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, you can get the 2023 model for even less now that its successor is available. But if you&apos;re stuck choosing between these two phones, I would suggest grabbing the newer and much better Stylus 5G 2024.</p>

<p>Caleb asks:</p><p><em><strong>I just bought a Pixel 8 and am a little confused at the location settings screen. What is Google Location Accuracy? Do i need to enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning? I just want to make sure my phone can tell a 911 operator where it is if i ever need to call.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It&apos;s been a while since i had a new phone so I want to make sure I get everything right. Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>I&apos;ll be honest, this is something that I haven&apos;t looked at in a while and I can see why you might have questions — it&apos;s a mess! I&apos;m going to assume an Android update made the changes and put all the options out there, and in typical Google fashion, there isn&apos;t much to explain them.</p><p>The good news first: making sure emergency services can locate you is now easier than ever because there&apos;s a single dedicated option for it.</p><p>The bad news is that some of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-show-all-android-location-sharing-settings-in-one-place">may be changing again</a> as part of the changes expected to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">Google&apos;s Find My Device network</a>. In the meantime, let&apos;s take a look at how it works today.</p>
<p>On your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro-deals-of-the-month">Pixel phone</a>, it&apos;s called <strong>Emergency Location Service for your Android device. </strong>It should be labeled as something similar on another brand and every phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> or higher and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google Services</a> support should have a setting for it.</p><p>If you tap to open the settings choice, you can toggle it on or off. When it&apos;s on, any time you call or text an emergency number, anything that helps get a more precise location for you can be turned on. That location data is forwarded to an "authorized emergency partner" who will tell emergency services where you are located.</p><p>Note that this means a trusted (by Google) third party gets the data, uses it to get your actual location, and then sends it to emergency services. The operator you&apos;re calling isn&apos;t (and probably can&apos;t) interpret the data themselves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.18%;"><img id="ZSE7Wgm5jSJm6cVfL4vGCc" name="Google-emergency-location.png" alt="Google Location settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZSE7Wgm5jSJm6cVfL4vGCc.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="2423" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like me, you sound curious about how this works with Google Location Accuracy, Wi-Fi scanning, and Bluetooth scanning. ELS will turn these things on, then turn Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth on to use them if needed. The documentation doesn&apos;t say it will turn them off afterward, though, and I can&apos;t test that without actually trying it; I can&apos;t just call 911 and say "I wanna test something." I assume it <em>doesn&apos;t</em> turn them off and you should do that manually if you don&apos;t want them enabled. Either way, it&apos;s the last thing you should worry about if there is an emergency.</p><p>But what are those services? There <em>is</em> documentation about that and I climbed into that rabbit hole because this is the sort of thing l love learning about!</p>
<p><strong>Google Location Accuracy:</strong> When Google Location Accuracy is off, your phone uses GPS radios and local sensors like the accelerometer or barometer to determine your location. When turned on, Wi-Fi and your mobile data network are used in tandem with GPS and sensor data.</p><p>This can be set on a per-app basis, too. If you use an app that requests location, choose <strong>precise</strong> to use Google Location Accuracy, or <strong>approximate</strong> to disable it.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning: </strong>When these settings are enabled, your phone will periodically scan for existing Wi-Fi access points or Bluetooth devices. Many APs and Bluetooth beacons are in known locations so scanning for them could tell an app you&apos;re 50 feet away from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, for example.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to connect to anything because your distance away from a known access point or Bluetooth beacon can be determined by signal strength alone.</p>
<p>When your phone uses all these methods to determine its location, it can be done much faster and more accurately than with GPS alone. GPS and sensors are still helpful, but knowing you&apos;re close to something like a known Wi-Fi AP narrows things down quickly.</p>

<p>I can&apos;t tell you what you might want to do when it comes to your location, how it&apos;s tracked, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-app-live-location-sharing">who you share it with</a>. You should do what feels most comfortable to you and not listen to anyone on the internet who says you <em><strong>have</strong></em> to do something. I can tell you what I do, and why though.</p><p>I value my privacy and do not want my location shared with just any person or company. Having said that, I leave everything enabled. </p><p>This is because of Android granular Location permission. When an apps wants to use your location you have a few choices — you can tell it no, never. You can tell it only when I want to use this app, and you can tell it to only use an approximate location.</p>
<p>I think this is where someone can be more choosy about sharing their data. Leaving everything enabled means I can get a fast and precise location if and when I need it, but only if and when I need it. the Lowe&apos;s app can pound sand and I&apos;ll enter my location manually.</p><p>You&apos;ll find people who think differently, and you should listen to what they are saying, too. The most important thing is that you know almost every app or website out there wants to try and track your location and you have ways to limit who can do it and how.</p><p>In any case, we should all leave <strong>Emergency Location Service</strong> turned on in case we need it. Better safe than sorry.</p>
