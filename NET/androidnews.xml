<ul><li>A report shows Google's addition of a "Backup and Copy data" option on the Pixel 9 series, which brings anytime data transfers from old phones.</li><li>Google explains that users can copy photos, messages, and more from an old phone at any time without wiping their device.</li><li>This feature is similar to a recently discovered feature earlier this year called "Restore Anytime."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google finally brings a data transferring capability to the Pixel 9 that&apos;s a total time saver.</p><p>As Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-restore-anytime-3473343/" target="_blank">Android Authority pointed out</a>, Google brought seamless data transfer from your old device to the Pixel 9 series. Rahman discovered a new "Backup or copy data" option within the Pixel 9&apos;s Settings.</p><p>The backup option has always remained consistent as it tosses your pre-approved data into the Cloud for safekeeping. However, Google has added a "Copy data" button to let users "bring data from another device."</p><p>Opening this expands its full contents, informing users they can "choose" what to bring over from an older Android phone. The page states users can select photos, contacts, messages, and more. It&apos;s worth noting that nothing brought over will replace what you&apos;ve done on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> after setup; it simply <em>merges.</em></p><p>Additionally, our internal tests show that this method isn&apos;t as granular as it should be, especially when compared to methods like Samsung&apos;s Smart Switch. You can bring over photos; however, you&apos;re unable to get specific and choose only a select number of pictures or albums.</p><p>As Rahman also notes, the Pixel 9&apos;s new "copy" option lets users transfer things over little by little or all at once at a later date. Previously, Google&apos;s data restoration page was only offered during <em>initial </em>setup, meaning if you weren&apos;t interested, it disappeared only to resurface after a total data wipe.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we&apos;ve seen a feature similar to this earlier this year, dubbed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-preps-data-restore-tool-transfer-upgrades">Restore Anytime</a>." The function was two-pronged as users could be in for faster data transfer speeds as Google works to implement the cable method with Wi-Fi. Moreover, Restore Anytime refers to Google&apos;s development of an Android that lets users copy data at any point to a new device <em>without </em>wiping the phone.</p><p>This mirrors what the company has done with the Pixel 9 series. Restore Anytime&apos;s initial code discovery didn&apos;t mention Pixel device exclusivity, so perhaps there&apos;s a chance all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> will adopt this new function.</p><p>Google launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">the Pixel 9 series</a> last week, and availability is expected to start on August 22. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">review of the devices</a> shows that Google&apos;s implementation of more AI is more than just a slew of buzzwords — some are exciting.</p><p>Not only will users get to play with "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>" and "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-rollout">Zoom Enhance</a>," but Gemini Live enters as a new conversational variant to cover a wide range of topics.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Your new Pixel 9 has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">built-in Satellite SOS feature</a>, a lot like the one Apple includes in the iPhone. It&apos;s also a feature that looks to be headed for <em>a lot</em> of other Android phones, based on the companies involved and the hardware supported.</p><p>That&apos;s cool and while nobody ever wants to need it, having it is good. It could mean the difference between something terrible like freezing atop a mountain or being safe at home. I know which one I&apos;d pick.</p>
<p>It uses tech from a company called Skylo and Garmin, but how exactly does it work? This is something you might want to know about before you need it.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<p>You don&apos;t need anything extra, and the only requirement is to be able to see the sky. All the software you need is built into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>What you do is call 911 (or the appropriate emergency services number in your area) and hope that someone answers. If they don&apos;t because you don&apos;t have cell coverage, you&apos;ll see an option to use Satellite SOS right in the dialer.</p><p>Tap on it and follow the guide to describe your situation (if you can), then point the phone towards the sky as instructed. You should get a message back in a few minutes letting you know someone heard you.</p><p>You&apos;ll be able to demo Satellite SOS in the <strong>Safety & emergency</strong> section of your phone setting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RoWwEv3y7c4QoaHF2oiLC9" name="Pixel-Satellite-SOS-demo-Google.jpg" alt="Google demo of Satellite SOS working on a Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RoWwEv3y7c4QoaHF2oiLC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cool part is how all of this happens. You don&apos;t need to know any of this to use the service, but it&apos;s fun to understand how things really work. I reached out to Skylo and got some answers, and combined with their existing documentation, it&apos;s easy to piece them together.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/about-us">Skylo</a> is a tech company that works with satellite companies to send, receive, and route messages to and from land-based devices like your phone. It isn&apos;t launching spacecraft, but it knows how to talk with them.</p><p>The emergency message on your phone is directly sent using a high-density, high-energy 3.75kHz signal to a satellite about 23,000 miles away. The outgoing messages don&apos;t require any sort of base station and that&apos;s why the service has such a large footprint.</p>
<p>Once that signal is received by the satellite, it&apos;s sent back to a Skylo Earth station. Skylo interprets and routes the information and any assorted extra data like location to Garmin (the same Garmin that makes things like smartwatches). </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/corporate/garmin-announces-support-of-new-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel-smartphones/">Garmin has a 24/7 response team</a> that handles this sort of thing. Garmin isn&apos;t new at this, and the company offers similar products of its own to help locate and rescue people who need them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.30%;"><img id="9qsTgBSmwWSYzmNGr43b3S" name="Skylo_coverage.png" alt="Skylo coverage map" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qsTgBSmwWSYzmNGr43b3S.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="956" height="586" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Skylo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin Response then finds out exactly where you are based on coordinates sent through the Skylo service, and contacts the right local response team to make sure you get the help you need.</p>
<p>This is all really cool to me, but the coolest part is that this is only the beginning. Skylo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/certified-devices">currently supports</a> 10 certified satellite modules and eight certified mobile chipsets from companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek, and Sony. There are plans to certify even more already in place.</p><p>The company&apos;s tech itself is present in nine Earth-based stations connected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.skylo.tech/partners">five satellite operators</a>. There are 50 million square kilometers across North America and Europe already covered and rollout is underway in Asia, Australia, and South America.</p>
<p>It won&apos;t be long until you&apos;ll be able to find the help you need from just about any place on Earth, using one of many different phones. Tech like this shouldn&apos;t be locked behind one product and Skylo is working to make sure it isn&apos;t.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some additional information is coming to light about Samsung&apos;s next tablet series, doubling down on previous speculation.</p><p>A set of marketing images obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra">Android Headlines</a> suggests that we are in a situation <em>without </em>a base Galaxy Tab S10 model. The alleged rendering of the Tab S10 Plus shows a design language similar to what we received with the Tab S9 Plus. Speculation states it will continue to feature a vertical, dual camera array on its back panel with a selfie camera likely in its bezel.</p><p>Rumors add that the other rendering is of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, as noted by the display notch. Other aspects of the tablet remain similar to what we&apos;ve seen prior, which suggests Samsung isn&apos;t interested in shifting designs.</p><p>The center image might clue us into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI feature</a> for the Galaxy Tab S10 pairing this year. Users may be able to use AI to automatically generate transcripts while recording audio with the tablets.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are rumored to arrive in silver and graphite colorways. It seems the company is moving away from the beige option it delivered last year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 series</a> in favor of silver. Additionally, it was theorized that Samsung could launch an "entry-level" Tab S10, but that could occur within the A series or as another FE.</p>

<p>Rumors about Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S10 series have continuously piled on top of older speculation claiming that it would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">ditch the base model</a>. The company is reportedly more interested in producing tablets with a larger display size, starting at 12 inches. Speaking of, we got our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">first alleged glimpse</a> at the Tab S10 Ultra with a supposed 14.6-inch display.</p><p>So, it seems safe to guess that the Plus model may begin at that lower 12-inch realm.</p><p>Regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-s10-ultra-charging-speed-leak">its charging speeds</a>, that information was leaked following its appearance in China&apos;s 3C Certification database. The devices are rumored to once again feature 45W wired fast charging, a speed that&apos;s been consistent across several of Samsung&apos;s previous iterations. It remains to be seen if the battery capacities change considering last year&apos;s S9 Plus and Ultra feature a 10,090mAh and an 11,200mAh battery, respectively.</p><p>What&apos;s most important is the launch date, which Samsung stated would take place "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-2024-launch-confirmed">later this year</a>." However, rumors quickly jumped onboard, claiming that the Galaxy Tab S10 series could launch in October alongside the Galaxy S24 FE.</p>

<ul><li>Honor sat down with CNET to discuss how its ultra-thin and durable Magic V3 came into being.</li><li>The company stated how deeply it invested in the R&D side of batteries to pack one larger than its predecessor into a much thinner frame.</li><li>Honor also didn't want to sacrifice quality photography, thus is why we have the large octagonal camera bump.</li><li>The Honor Magic V3 launched in China in mid-July, but the company is preparing for a global debut at IFA 2024 on September 5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor launched an incredibly thin foldable in July, and the company is getting candid about how that happened and its tough durability.</p><p>An interview with Honor&apos;s Magic V3 product expert Hope Cao and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/how-honor-designed-and-tested-the-ridiculously-thin-magic-v3-foldable-phone/" target="_blank">CNET</a> highlights how it was known that "stronger and slimmer" was always the goal. Many of the internal components of a phone or, in this case, a foldable contribute to its thickness. The Magic V3 boasts five cameras and a beefy 5,150mAh silicon carbon battery. All of that was placed within a 9.2mm (folded), 4.35mm (unfolded) chassis.</p><p>Technically speaking, it appears difficult to pull off, but Honor informed the publication that it relied heavily on the R&D side of the battery. The purpose was to fit such a large battery into a thinner body to avoid sacrificing the longevity consumers have come to expect.</p><p>Then, there&apos;s the device&apos;s large camera bump, which takes on an octagonal shape. The reason behind it is similar to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">huge visor on the Pixel 9</a>: to keep photo quality high, crisp, and clear. Honor stated it took inspiration from "architectural dome structures" when designing the camera bump to avoid an eye-sore situation.</p><p>Durability is the other side of the Magic V3, as the company sought to deal with some user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Honor/comments/1d48dmi/magic_v2_screen_broken/">frustration with its predecessor</a>. Honor added that it upgraded its hinge with an "extra set of swing arms." For context, typical foldable hinges only offer one set of swing arms, but Honor&apos;s additional set is said to increase its resilience by 1,250% over the Magic V2.</p><p>Cao said that Honor is investing specifically in "steel materials as part of the hinge" for durability reasons. Moreover, Honor&apos;s investments have bear fruit as it states the Magic V3&apos;s hinge has been tested to withstand 500,000 folds. Unfortunately, as the post notes, the device lacks full dust resistance and sports an IPX8 rating, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. On the plus side, this means the phone can be fully submerged in water</p>

<p>Consumers in China are currently the only ones able to snatch up Honor&apos;s new thin Magic V3 foldable that beats the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hands-on">likes of Samsung</a>. The phone&apos;s launch showcased its 6.43-inch cover display and immersive 7.92-inch internal screen. Internally, it&apos;s powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p><p>The phone&apos;s rear camera array features a 50MP primary camera, a 40MP ultrawide-angle camera, and a 50MP periscope telephoto camera. The two front cameras (cover and internal) are also 50MP. Despite these specs, Honor told CNET there&apos;s more work to do. Cao said, "We do have some room to improve, especially the total photography performance and as well as the thickness of the module."</p><p>Honor&apos;s Magic V3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">debuted in China</a> alongside the Magic Vs3, which is just as sleek but with some unique attributes. What&apos;s more, global consumers should expect some Honor magic as the company is preparing to show off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-next-gen-foldable-will-convince-you-to-ditch-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-its-going-global-at-ifa-2024">Magic V3 at IFA 2024</a> on September 5.</p>

Unfortunately, it&apos;s not quite there, despite Google inflating the price by $100 to match some other competitors, but it gets close, offering plenty of fun AI features that users are sure to love (or ignore).</p><p>So what&apos;s new with the Pixel 9, how is it different from its Pro siblings, and is it worth getting over the cheaper Pixel 8? That phone was priced well at just $699, but has Google justified the price increase of its latest model?</p><p>I&apos;ve spent about a week with the Pixel 9 so far, so I&apos;ll attempt to shed some light on the matter since the device hits store shelves soon after this review gets published.

<p>The Google Pixel 9 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9-series-boasts-a-faster-chip-brighter-screens-and-new-ai-features">announced</a> in early August 2024 during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google 2024 event</a> and goes on sale on August 22. The phone starts at $799 for the 12GB/128GB variant, while the 256GB version is priced at $899. However, you will most likely be able to find some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">compelling Pixel 9 deals</a> if you shop around enough.</p><p>The phone is available in four different colors: Peony (pink), Wintergreen (green), Obsidian (black), and Porcelain (silver/white).</p><p>Google will sell the Pixel 9 in the following countries: U.S., Canada, U.K., Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 9 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">9 Pro Fold</a>, which receive a one-year free trial of Gemini Advanced, the Pixel 9 only receives a one-month trial in regions where the offer is available.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-11.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> looks quite different from its predecessor, but many of the main design cues are still there. Notably, the camera visor is no longer connected to the device&apos;s frame; it&apos;s now a floating camera bar with an all-aluminum side and a rounded cutout for the dual camera system. In fact, the shape of the camera bar reminds me of the Pixel&apos;s rather large and bubbly Quick Settings button, which brings an unexpected level of cohesion.</p><p>One thing I was concerned about regarding the new Pixel 9 design was the new flat design, particularly the frame. After using phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, I&apos;ve become a bit weary of sharp edges as they tend not to play nice with my poor finger when handling the phones one-handed. Fortunately, that&apos;s not the case here, as the satin metal frame is surprisingly soft, and Google gave it a very slight curve where the frame meets the front and rear panels, which keeps the phone from digging into your pinky finger.</p><p>I do agree with Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, who said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a> the new design reminds him of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">the latest iPhones</a>, at least if you look at it from the front and the sides, but not everyone here thinks so.</p>

<p>The phone is surprisingly comfortable to hold. Beyond its soft frame and somewhat slick glass panels, the phone is still fairly small despite being a couple of millimeters larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Given its size, I wouldn&apos;t exactly put this among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small Android phones</a>, but the 6.3-inch OLED panel is handled well thanks to the minimal and uniform bezels. My only complaint is that despite not having the smallest bezels I&apos;ve dealt with, I find my finger accidentally activating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> pretty often. It&apos;s not a huge annoyance, but something to point out if you enable the feature.</p><p>The OLED display looks great, and while I normally leave phones on Natural color mode, the Adaptive display mode doesn&apos;t overly saturate colors like I find on other phones. You will have to remember to turn on Smooth display to kick up to the 120Hz refresh rate, but once you do, it&apos;s smooth sailing. The added brightness also means that there should be no problem viewing content when outdoors. Just make sure to slap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">Pixel 9 screen protector</a>, as I&apos;ve already noticed some very light scratches.</p><p>I also have no complaints so far about the new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which feels fast and accurate.</p><p>The phone has pretty decent haptics and good audio, which doesn&apos;t surprise me. The dual stereo speakers sound very full, with plenty of depth and good bass response, while the haptics remain quite subtle when navigating the phone or when receiving notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-20.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Tensor G4 chipset isn&apos;t a huge upgrade over its predecessor, but that matters very little here. Coupled with 12GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 performs quite well when opening and juggling apps. I think most people buying this phone will be pleased with its performance, especially when it comes to AI tasks. I also haven&apos;t noticed the phone getting too warm when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail or Fall Guys, which is a good sign to me, although touch input does seem ever-so-slightly delayed at times.</p>

<p>My initial impression of the Pixel cameras, based on my limited time with the phone so far, is that they&apos;re damn good. Images are detailed and crisp, and there&apos;s a great deal of dynamic range, even in lower lighting conditions. I do find that images sometimes lack that extra punch of vibrancy or saturation that I like, and as a result, sometimes photos can appear a bit dull. I&apos;ve also seen instances where the sky might get blown out, but this doesn&apos;t happen too often. Otherwise, images have nice natural bokeh, and Macro Focus takes it to another level by letting you get really close.</p>

<p>One feature I haven&apos;t had an opportunity to test out too much is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>, which lets the person taking a photo add themselves to the image after it&apos;s been taken. It&apos;s a very neat feature, and I&apos;ve seen some excellent examples that make it look pretty convincing that everyone was in the photo.</p><p>My example (below) is admittedly a bit different from what Google had in mind, and at first glance, it looks fine until you squint and realize something&apos;s off.  The result isn&apos;t perfect, but being able to capture yourself twice in the same frame is a very cool effect that I wouldn&apos;t be able to replicate easily using photo editing applications.</p><p>For a more traditional use of Add Me, Sutrich has seen a result from the feature with him and his family, and you can check it out on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro review</a>. It&apos;s a much better example, but even then, it takes a squint to realize something&apos;s off and that someone has essentially been added to the photo. Still, it&apos;s a very cool feature that I can&apos;t wait to try out more, and I&apos;m just glad this feature isn&apos;t limited to the Pro phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:132.81%;"><img id="XUcowacT4B8WR9EoFruF2C" name="Google-Pixel-9-add-me-sample-same-person.jpg" alt="Using Add Me on the Pixel 9 with the same person twice" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XUcowacT4B8WR9EoFruF2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3072" height="4080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;ve been quite impressed with the battery life so far. The phone easily lasts me until the end of the day, and I get around seven or eight hours of screen time, which is pretty good. Google claims 24+ battery life and even longer with Energy Saver (since that&apos;s kind of how it works), and while I haven&apos;t gotten more than a day of battery life, I imagine it will vary based on your use.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> with Multimodality, meaning it can handle some pretty complicated stuff. I&apos;ve played around with a few of the new AI features, and so far, I&apos;m pretty impressed. Among them, Pixel Studio is probably my favorite new app. It&apos;s a text-to-image generator powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s new Imagen 3 model</a>. It&apos;s pretty easy to use, allowing you to go into existing images available in the studio or to create your own from scratch.</p><p>The results are pretty damn impressive, and more often than not, they put a smile on my face. The app does quite well in generating clear, high-quality images, and the results can be spot-on, including how the app generates text like book or movie titles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mG4yaFLY9kVVaDcBFVVTNG" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-17.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on the Google Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mG4yaFLY9kVVaDcBFVVTNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> also has some interesting new features, like Reimagine, which lets you change aspects of a photo in your gallery by typing a prompt. You can pretty much completely transform an image with surprisingly good detail. The results may not be completely perfect, but the feature feels more versatile and capable than what I&apos;ve seen with Samsung&apos;s Sketch to Image feature.</p>

<p>Call Notes is a useful way to record and transcribe calls, and it not only lets you replay the recording or search through the transcription, but the feature also summarizes the details of the call, in case you just need to remember what the gist of the conversation was.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Pixel Weather, which is a beautiful app that provides AI-generated reports of the rest of your day and what you can expect the following day, complete with weather animations. It does a decent job of covering the basic points of the forecast without overloading you with information, although I can see how some people would want even more detail. That said, I&apos;m not sure how useful the AI-generated reports are, as their main purpose seems to be to summarize the information already presented to you.</p>

<p>Speaking of usefulness, I&apos;m also unsure about how I feel about Gemini Live and Pixel Screenshots. The former is an interesting conversational version of Gemini, allowing you to have pretty natural conversations with the chatbot to maybe provide some inspiration or assistance. It actually sounds surprisingly natural in its responses and appears to understand my queries well, even if they&apos;re multilayered or if I&apos;m seemingly rambling a bit. I asked for some diet tips to achieve my goal weight, and it provided some sound advice. I then followed up by asking for exercises that could help, and it gave equally sound advice.</p><p>Then, a day later, Gemini Live wasn&apos;t able to remember the weight goal. I gave it just a day prior, so I had to remind it during follow-up queries. Basically, I can see this being a useful feature occasionally when you have very specific and multi-layered questions, but I already don&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> very much, so I&apos;m not sure how much I would use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> or Gemini Live on a regular basis.</p><p>The downside of Gemini Live is that it&apos;s tied to Gemini Advanced, which is locked behind a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscription. So, in addition to paying $100 more for the phone, you now have to dish out an extra $20 a month for one of the more interesting features. I can&apos;t imagine many people would subscribe just to use Gemini Live, but if you&apos;re already paying similar amounts for your Google One subscription, it might be worth switching to for the additional perks.</p>

<p>The Pixel Screenshots app feels even less useful to me, as it&apos;s simply just a way to search screenshots and create AI summaries of them. My thing is that most of the screenshots I take are of funny memes or photos that I find interesting, and it&apos;s rarely anything that I ever need to recall. I&apos;m sure some people will find it useful, and I may end up changing my mind as I continue testing the phone, but right now, it just feels a bit superfluous.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are other aspects of the battery that I&apos;m less impressed by. The 27W charging is almost unbearably slow, which is something that has always annoyed me about Pixel phones. Unlike the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which charged up to 70% in just 30 minutes, the Pixel 9 takes the same amount of time to just reach 50%, although those figures are based on a 45W Google charger.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a Google 45W charger, and my experience has been quite different, with the phone taking a bit longer to reach 50% and then having to wait another hour to get to full when using a 100W charger from Anker. Fortunately, 50% still lasts you a good amount of the day, but wired and wireless charging speeds fall behind many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">flagship Android phones</a> with fast charging capabilities.</p><p>You also won&apos;t find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 wireless charging</a>. This isn&apos;t the end of the world, and to some, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">this is actually a good thing</a>. However, with the popularity of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe cases for Android phones</a>, it&apos;s surprising to see Google skip out on the standard that people clearly want when it&apos;s been available for some time now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="jkze5rZPEMXW5dH5W2aK9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Casefity-clear.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 in a clear Casetify case with a MagSafe ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkze5rZPEMXW5dH5W2aK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Storage is also a problem for the Pixel 9. The base model comes with just 128GB, which just seems small for a flagship phone in 2024. As such, after setting up the Pixel and moving apps and audio over from my daily driver, the Pixel told me I had used 92GB, leaving me with about 36GB remaining. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-still-cant-get-the-basics-right-on-pixels">pointed out</a> by Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> that have double this amount of storage, so the fact that the three Pixel 9 series phones start with 128GB is a bit ridiculous.</p><p>The Pixel 9 also lacks a third rear camera. This becomes particularly clear when compared to the Galaxy S24, which is also priced at $799 and sports a third lens for 3x telephoto images. Sure, the Pixel takes pretty good images with up to 8x Super Res Zoom, but the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera limits the zoom capabilities when compared to the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4001px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.78%;"><img id="yLhXfijjR842Rp9mMWegd6" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-09.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLhXfijjR842Rp9mMWegd6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4001" height="2672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that&apos;s not the only way Google is limiting the Pixel 9 compared to the Pixel 9 Pro. Despite sporting the same Tensor G4 chip and 12GB of RAM, enough to handle on-device AI processing, Google has omitted certain camera features from the base Pixel 9, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, Pro Controls, High-Res photos, and more.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear why these features are not included, and when asked, Google wasn&apos;t able to provide a clear answer on why there&apos;s such a feature disparity, making it seem as though it&apos;s just gatekeeping features for its more expensive phones. It&apos;s a bit unfortunate since I don&apos;t think Samsung does the same thing with the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, and that only has 8GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-the-competition"><span>Google Pixel 9: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the base Pixel 9 model, there are a few other phones you can consider at or below this price point from companies like Samsung and OnePlus.</p><p>The base Galaxy S24 is the closest competitor to the Pixel 9, offering a similarly small, mostly flat chassis and comparable specs. One major difference is the presence of a telephoto camera, something the Pixel 9 lacks. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 comes with 12GB of RAM, which should make it more capable when it comes to on-device AI processing. It also has a larger battery, which should theoretically help it last longer on a single charge. Otherwise, both offer similar software promises and great camera quality for the same price.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is another similarly priced option for anyone looking for a flagship. As far as specs go, the phone bests the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S24 in many areas, sporting a larger battery, much faster charging, and up to 16GB of RAM. The downside to getting a OnePlus is that the software isn&apos;t for everyone, and support isn&apos;t as robust. The phone also isn&apos;t as water resistant, so you can&apos;t submerge it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-should-you-buy-it"><span>Google Pixel 9: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4203px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7V3Jdyb6mbmn6Q6z3d7kUo" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-02.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7V3Jdyb6mbmn6Q6z3d7kUo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4203" height="2364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a new Google flagship without spending $1000.</li><li>You want the latest AI features on your phone before anyone else.</li><li>You want some of the best cameras on the market.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You own a Pixel 8.</li><li>You want a phone with fast charging capabilities.</li><li>You want a phone with a telephoto camera and Pro camera controls.</li></ul>
<p>As noted, I&apos;ve only used the Pixel 9 for about a week, and there&apos;s still plenty that I want to test out more thoroughly. However, for the purposes of this initial review, I think that the Pixel 9 is a great phone that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">you should consider purchasing for your next upgrade</a>, especially if you&apos;re not trying to drop $1000 on a Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Tensor G4 may not be the most powerful chip on the market, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">it&apos;s perfect for the purposes of the Pixel</a> and how Google is positioning this phone, especially when paired with 12GB of RAM. Performance is great, battery life is great, and you won&apos;t be disappointed by its cameras... that is unless you&apos;re hoping for a telephoto lens with strong zoom capabilities.</p><p>Yes, the Pixel 9 still doesn&apos;t get all the features you&apos;ll find on the Pro phones, and that&apos;s a problem. Plus, one of the more interesting features is locked behind a subscription. If you think you would want some of those missing features, then you should spring for the Pro phones. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 is still a good phone, even if it costs $100 more than its predecessor.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are now officially available as of August 22, 2024. Both models offer a choice of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, as well as 16GB of RAM. You can choose from either size in a range of colors, including Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white), Hazel (grey), and Rose Quartz (pink).</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 with 128GB of storage, while the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1099 with 128GB of storage. You can buy the Pixel 9 series in any of the following countries:</p>
<ul><li><strong>NAMER: </strong>US, Canada</li><li><strong>EMEA:</strong> Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, UK</li><li><strong>APAC: </strong>Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan</li></ul>
<p>All Pixel 9 models include Pixel VPN at no additional cost, which helps protect you while on the go and connecting to potentially unscrupulous public Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is also including one year of Gemini Advanced with every Google Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL, which would normally cost $20 per month with the AI-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription</a>.</p><p>Each Google Pixel 9 Pro box contains no plastic and is impressively environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>This past weekend, I spent a lot of time with my family. Inevitably, lots of pictures are taken, but none of them <em>ever</em> have everyone in the frame. The Pixel 9 Pro changed that for the better, and I couldn&apos;t be happier with the result. Some have wondered how useful the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google" target="_blank">Add Me feature</a> might be, but let me tell you this: it&apos;s totally invaluable, and I hope this comes to other Android phones.</p><p>Being able to include everyone in a photo — one that&apos;s an actual <strong>good</strong> photo of everyone and not a lame selfie at an awkward angle to fit everyone in — is pure genius of the highest form. It&apos;s one of those features that makes AI make sense, something particularly important in a day in age where AI is invading everything and seemingly providing very little value given it&apos;s monumental R&D cost.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Add Me is my favorite new camera mode of the decade, so far.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not perfect — there are some telltale signs that someone was cropped and placed into the frame if you look close — but I&apos;d wager no one would look for these small imperfections if you don&apos;t ask them to look. As it stands, Add Me is my favorite new camera mode so far this decade.</p>

<p>Fans of Panoramas will also adore the Pixel 9 Pro series, as the new panorama mode allows it to take <em>substantially</em> better panoramas, especially when the lighting isn&apos;t exactly perfect.</p><p>Putting them side-by-side with quite literally <em>any</em> other phone shows how much better Google&apos;s new panorama feature is, and I fully expect to see these upgrades make their way to other phones in the future. For now, though, this is the phone for panorama lovers.</p>

<p>And while I&apos;m covering new features, the Pixel Screenshots app has been even more impressive than I initially expected it to be. One of the biggest reasons for this is that it automatically imported every screenshot stored in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> that I&apos;ve ever taken.</p><p>That&apos;s <em>years </em>of screenshots, all processed and indexed, now searchable locally. If I were to continue using this phone long-term, I&apos;d be changing how I take notes and, instead, just take screenshots and categorize them for later.</p>

<p>Another surprise came in the form of the phone&apos;s design itself. Despite initial misgivings about the very iPhone-like redesign, the design has grown on me even if I still prefer the Pixel 8&apos;s design language overall. Google&apos;s design director said the company now designs its phones to be put in cases, and that seems to fit perfectly with my experience with the phone. Indeed, both phones look and feel best in a case, and that&apos;s saying a lot since I&apos;m normally a case-less kind of guy.</p><p>So far, my favorite case is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Aramid-Magnetic-Minimalist/dp/B0D86S45JD/">Thinborne Pixel 9 Pro case</a>, which came as no surprise since I&apos;ve loved Thinborne&apos;s minimalist cases for years. It adds almost no bulk to the phone while giving it an important element of grippiness, something that&apos;s vital given how crazy slippery these new phones are. It also adds MagSafe capability, so you can use some compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a> and chargers.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Ever since the first Samsung Galaxy Note came out, I've been the person who picks the biggest phone possible. But while I've been using the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL, I've found myself grabbing the smaller one most of the time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve also been <em>very </em>surprised at how much I love the smaller-sized Pixel 9 Pro. Ever since the first Samsung Galaxy Note came out, I&apos;ve been the person who picks the biggest phone possible. But while I&apos;ve been using the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL, I&apos;ve find myself grabbing the smaller one most of the time.</p><p>Part of it is that it just feels so much nicer to use, particularly one-handed. It&apos;s a wonderful size, and its flatter shape makes it a delight to use all day. It also helps that there&apos;s feature parity between the models, so I don&apos;t miss out on anything important when choosing the smaller model. That&apos;s a first for Pixels.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the camera is another one of the phone&apos;s best features. I&apos;ve already covered how amazing the Add Me feature and the panorama upgrades are, but the best-hidden feature is one I&apos;ve written about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-best-smartphone-camera-parents-heres-why">since the Pixel 6 days</a>: Pixels take photos of moving objects — that primarily means pets and kids — better than any phone in the U.S. market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't buy another phone series in the U.S. that takes crisp imagery of your never-sit-still kids or pets like a Pixel can.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Internationally, phones from Honor (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-pixel-8a-and-pro-camera-review">Honor 200 Pro</a>) have caught up, but you can&apos;t buy another phone series in the U.S. that takes crisp imagery of your favorite little ones like a Pixel can. I&apos;ll have a more detailed breakdown of these phones&apos; cameras in a separate camera review, but overall, it seems like a marginal upgrade over the Pixel 8 Pro in most ways.</p><p>Battery life has also been wonderful, and while I haven&apos;t noticed much of a difference between either of these phones and last year&apos;s Pixel 8 Pro, benchmarks tell a different story.</p><p>Our parent company, Future PLC, runs lab tests via the Future Labs department and found that it took over an average of 13 hours to run down the battery on the Pixel 9 Pro <strong>and</strong> the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Comparatively, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> died after just 9 hours of running the same test. Clearly, Google wasn&apos;t kidding when they said Tensor G4&apos;s efficiency was better.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Daily performance is worse than Pixel 8 Pro in some cases, but Pixel 9 Pro/XL don't get searingly hot like that phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;m very pleased to report that Google seems to have finally conquered the excessive heat issues that have plagued Tensor-powered Pixels with Tensor G4 on the Pixel 9 series. While performance is actually worse in some cases when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a> (read below for that), the phone doesn&apos;t become as hot as a frying pan when playing games for a long time — although it does still get warm.</p><p>This more aggressive throttling not only keeps the phone from heating up as the Pixel 8 Pro does, but it also keeps it from having huge framerate dips while playing. In a Minecraft test, I saw the Pixel 8 Pro drop to as low as 35FPS for a minute, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL never dipped below 65FPS.</p>

<p>Some of my biggest problems with both of these phones are ones that, thankfully, not everyone will have to deal with. First off, the new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner has been super hit-or-miss with me. Some days, it works fine and feels no different from the excellent optical fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>On other days, it works half the time or less. There have been times when it flat-out doesn&apos;t work at all for me, which you can see in the GIF below. I&apos;ve complained about this problem since Samsung started using ultrasonic fingerprint sensors on the Galaxy S10 many moons ago. It turns out that I&apos;m not alone, and this technology just doesn&apos;t work well for some people, although I&apos;ve yet to get a straight answer as to why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.78%;"><img id="WQFavRizDwk2FNZGWXfu2f" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fingerprint-sensor-fail.gif" alt="Having a hard time using the Google Pixel 9 Pro's fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQFavRizDwk2FNZGWXfu2f.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The new fingerprint sensor doesn't work with some screen protectors and was generally unreliable for me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Worse yet, some screen protectors cause the fingerprint sensor to stop working entirely, forcing you to use Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">"bank grade" face unlock</a>. Some people prefer face unlock, but I&apos;m not sure how much I trust the single-camera solution despite Google telling us otherwise.</p><p>Thankfully, some people have reported that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9Q5KC3C/">this cheap tempered glass protector on Amazon</a> will work with the phone. Google says it officially supports options from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Mate-Google-Pixel-Screen-Protector/dp/B0DC12R4SN/">Case-Mate</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-Glass-Google-Screen-Protector/dp/B0D7KBYC3C/">Zagg</a>, Otterbox, and others. However, this won&apos;t fix the scanner&apos;s inconsistent nature for me, which seems incredibly susceptible to changes in skin moisture (and maybe other factors).</p><p>If Google had just made the fingerprint sensor in the power button a capacitive sensor — as it is on every foldable phone — this problem wouldn&apos;t exist.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X24ZT2npofmK28hhCxyqCe" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-homescreen-01.jpg" alt="Theming the homescreen of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X24ZT2npofmK28hhCxyqCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Second, the ultra-low 240Hz PWM rate used to "dim" the phone&apos;s display gives me terrible headaches, especially when I try to use the phone in the evening. This problem started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20suffering%20from,customer%20service%20team%20know%2C%20too.">about 2 years ago for me</a> and has only gotten worse as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">displays have gotten ultra-bright</a>.</p><p>The 3000-nit display on these phones is insanely bright, and flickering on and off at a low rate of 240Hz is nothing short of abysmal. Google is the only smartphone company that hasn&apos;t upgraded its rate — Samsung and Apple now use 480Hz on most devices — and companies like Honor and OnePlus push that rate to 2160Hz, 4320Hz, and beyond.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:172.42%;"><img id="Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pwm-measurement-100.jpg" alt="The PWM rate of the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL at 100% brightness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1008" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It doesn't get any worse for your eyes than this display. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this brightness, Google is not even close to complying with the recommended <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/">IEEE PAR 1789 standard</a> for displays and lighting.</p><p>And before we move beyond displays, the new rounder corners on the Pixel 9 series will inevitably cut off some UI elements in apps or games. It&apos;s not the end of the world, but I noticed some obvious clipping in Minecraft and other titles, which might bother some folks.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>For the second year in a row, Google has raised the price of Pixel Pro models by $100.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Beyond my personal issues with the phone are some more objective criticisms people are bound to face when using a Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL. As Android Central contributor Brady Snyder pointed out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">when he wrote this article</a>, the Tensor G4 processor inside the Pixel 9 series isn&apos;t much of an upgrade over the Tensor G3 in everyday tasks, including gaming performance.</p><p>As I said in the section above, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL stay cool even after gaming for 30 minutes or more. However, these phones throttle a lot faster than the Pixel 8 Pro and stay throttled while under heavy loads.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-01.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>On the best of days, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are as fast as a Galaxy S22.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In one test, I opened Minecraft on the bamboo forest template and left it running looking in the same direction on both phones for 30 minutes. At the end of the test, the Pixel 8 Pro had a framerate that stayed around the 80-95 FPS mark with dips into the 60s for a minute to cool down.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro hovered around 65-70FPS without these drastic dips — but also without the higher framerates of the Pixel 8 Pro. On the best of days, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL are as fast as a Galaxy S22 based on any number of tests I&apos;ve run over the past week.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Initial charging speed is faster than Pixel 8, but a full charge takes just as long.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a>, I talked about the new charging speeds for the phones and even was able to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-45w-usb-c-power-charger-snow/6587825.p?skuId=6587825">Google&apos;s new 45W charger</a>. While that charger is great for topping up the battery quickly from 0% to about 50% in under 30 minutes, a full charge isn&apos;t any faster than the Pixel 8 series — and charging the phone when it&apos;s above 50% battery level results in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">much slower charge</a> than you might expect.</p>

<p>All of this comes at $100 more than last year&apos;s phones, which were also $100 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> generation. Google offers a lot of value with its phones — things like seven years of software updates, quarterly feature updates and additions, free Pixel VPN, and lots of other goodies — but it&apos;s hard for me to justify paying $1100 for a phone with 128GB of storage in the second half of 2024.</p><p>And while a Pixel 9 Pro is "the same price" as a Pixel 8 Pro — $999 — you&apos;ll actually have to spend $1099 to get the same size phone as last year, the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Since Tensor isn&apos;t anywhere near as fast as the competition for everyday tasks or gaming, I have a distinct worry that the Pixel 9 will start feeling very slow before long, much less by the time seven years of software updates are up.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s biggest competition in the U.S. is both Samsung and Apple, and both companies offer phones with faster processors and displays with better PWM rates. The Galaxy S24 series is promised to deliver the same seven years of software updates as the Pixel 9 series, and given the gulf in performance between Google and Samsung&apos;s phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">any Galaxy S24 model</a> will likely last longer without feeling sluggish like the Pixel 9 eventually will.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an even better display and crazy fast charging speeds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> does it all while costing even less than a Pixel 9 Pro. I personally use a OnePlus 12 daily and am more than happy with it, especially given its superior multitasking UI. OnePlus only offers four years of software and OS updates, but you may not plan to hold on to your phone for more than that, so it&apos;s probably an OK trade-off.</p><p>Of course, none of these phones come with those nifty Pixel-exclusive features like call screening, VPN, Pixel Studio, and others. Plus, as I&apos;ve covered many times, Pixels take the best photos of kids and pets and now even have great features like Add Me that offer even more interesting photography options. And, unlike Samsung or OnePlus, The Pixel 9 Pro family gives you a choice of phone size without losing features or camera prowess.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have pets or kids that you take lots of pictures of.</li><li>You love Google's clever AI features and Pixel exclusives like call screening.</li><li>You like to keep your phones for years before updating.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should not buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You play lots of mobile games.</li><li>You want faster charging or more storage at a lower price.</li><li>You're sensitive to light flicker or displays that use low-Hz PWM dimming.</li></ul>
<p>Over the years, Google has figured out clever ways to differentiate its Pixel line from other phones in meaningful ways. Pixel-exclusive features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a>, advanced spam detection, and Pixel VPN have been mainstays of the line for years, while new Pixel-exclusive features like Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Studio, and camera modes like Add Me are sure to make your friends and family jealous.</p><p>But there&apos;s an underlying upfront value problem that continues to grow. Pixel is once again $100 more than the previous year. Tensor is still slower than other competing processors and heats up more quickly than those, too. Google hasn&apos;t improved its display dimming rate as other companies have, and the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is problematic for some people, too.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9 deals</a> will often get you the phone for next to nothing as Google tries to expand its reach globally and get more Pixels into more people&apos;s hands. It doesn&apos;t make up for some of the other problems the phone has, but it&apos;s easy to give Pixel a shot and see if all those amazing exclusive features and apps are more important to you than raw performance or charging speed. Plus, being able to choose a size without losing important features is finally a reality.</p><p>As for me, I&apos;ll be going back to using my OnePlus 12 now.</p>

<ul><li>After being initially announced in October 2023, Google said that Zoom Enhance would come to Pixel 8 Pro users soon in a blog post last week.</li><li>As of yesterday, Pixel 8 Pro owners are starting to see the feature appear as part of a Google Photos app update. </li><li>Google didn’t manage to ship Zoom Enhance on the Pixel 8 series before replacing it with the Pixel 9 series, and lessons can be learned about software promises from this blunder.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-rollout">Zoom Enhance</a>, a feature that was originally revealed before the Pixel 8 Pro officially launched, would finally make its way to that smartphone last week. As of Aug. 19, Pixel 8 Pro users started seeing Zoom Enhance appear in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>. The feature, which was first shown off at Google I/O 2023 more than a year ago, should serve as a great example of why you shouldn&apos;t buy products based on the promise of future updates.</p><p>Zoom Enhance was spotted in version 6.95 of Google Photos, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/19/pixel-8-pro-google-photos-zoom-enhance/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first reported, on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. It&apos;s designed for use with photos that have already been captured. In the <strong>Tools</strong> section of the Google Photos app, Zoom Enhance is an option on Pixel 8 Pro phones that have access to it. If you aren&apos;t seeing it yet, make sure your Google Photos app is up to date or force stop and restart it. </p><p>Google says that this tool will "intelligently fills in the gaps between pixels and predicts fine details." With that being said, don&apos;t expect perfection." The company adds that Zoom Enhance "is in its early stages and may generate unexpected or inaccurate results." For some, that might be a tough pill to swallow. Pixel 8 Pro users have been waiting nearly a year to access Zoom Enhance on their smartphones, and now that it&apos;s here, it might not work as expected.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/features-desktop-zoom-some-more-2312x1156_sized-for-kw.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/features-desktop-zoom-some-more-2312x1156_sized-for-kw.mp4"></video></div>
<p>The goal of Zoom Enhance is simple. While you can zoom into a photo after it has been taken, the quality of the image will degrade the more you zoom in. Photos could become pixelated, noisy, and lack clarity. Zoom Enhance tries to use generative AI to clear up the noise and increase clarity in images that you&apos;re zooming into. It&apos;s not unlike other forms of AI upscaling, which we&apos;ve seen in professional photo editors, video editors, and even PC gaming applications in the past.</p><p>However, keeping expectations manageable is crucial. Zoom Enhance won&apos;t be able to improve the quality of every image, and like other forms of generative AI, it may struggle specifically with finer details — such as text. Early tests of Zoom Enhance do seem to show an improvement over original photos, but the amount of improvement can vary on a case-by-case basis. To help Google improve Zoom Enhance overall, it&apos;s asking users to provide feedback on the results in the Google Photos app. </p>

<p>The problem with Zoom Enhance isn&apos;t that the feature is bad — it&apos;s that Google took way too long to ship it. We know by now that Pixel phones aren&apos;t going to lead the spec sheets or the benchmarks. Instead, the Google Pixel brand is all about creating a holistic experience, and software is a big part of that. You might choose a Pixel over another smartphone due to specific software features; for example, I love the Google Recorder app that&apos;s exclusive to Pixel devices.</p><p>This situation becomes tricky when Google showcases new features that are said to be coming to Pixel phones at a later date. The Zoom Enhance tool was debuted before the Pixel 8 Pro was available for purchase, and it&apos;s possible some buyers picked up a Pixel phone for that feature. If they did, they were probably disappointed to learn that their smartphone wouldn&apos;t get access to Zoom Enhance until after the even newer Pixel 9 series was officially unveiled. </p><p>Google isn&apos;t the only company that shows off upcoming features before they&apos;re ready. All companies do it, and I suspect that Apple will tout plenty of Apple Intelligence features with the iPhone 16 series launch despite the fact that those phones won&apos;t ship with them. As consumers, we need to be wary of how much stock we put into companies&apos; promises.</p><p>Android specifically has made the promise of future updates a key selling point for its platform. Google and Samsung have both marketed their flagships as offering seven years of full OS and security upgrades. While that&apos;s great to see on paper, we still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">don&apos;t know what those future "full OS upgrades" will look like</a>. Since Google has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-8-8a-receiving-gemini-nano-soon-should-make-you-skeptical-about-update-promise">struggled to bring Gemini Nano to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8a</a>, I&apos;m not very optimistic about those later upgrades. </p><p>We&apos;re seeing all kinds of companies promise future upgrades and market those improvements as a reason to buy a product today. Google taking a year to bring Zoom Enhance to the Pixel 8 Pro is the perfect example of why you shouldn&apos;t do that. Buy a product for what it is now, and be pleasantly surprised if it gets better over time. </p>

You can swim in pool or ocean water, and it can withstand rain, sweat, or normal showerhead pressure. But hot or high-pressure water can bypass its protections; don't use it during activities like water skiing or a spa day.</p>
<p>In addition, your Pixel Watch 3 band may not be water-resistant. Specifically, while the default Active band handles water, the official leather and metal bands aren't rated to handle water and should be dried off immediately after a wet or sweaty activity.</p></article></section>

<p>Officially, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> has water protection ratings of 5ATM and IP68, like most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> today. That means it&apos;s tested to last at depths of 50 meters for up to 10 minutes or 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. </p><p>It&apos;s also dust resistant, meaning salt water or beach sand shouldn&apos;t get inside the case.</p><p>While this 5ATM rating technically means you could wear your Pixel Watch 3 while you go snorkeling or diving, it&apos;s not quite as rugged for water sports as watches rated 10ATM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>In terms of what you shouldn&apos;t do with the Pixel Watch 3, it "should not be immersed in water for more than 24 hours, used during high-speed or high-impact water sports, or exposed to soapy water or other liquids," according to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652074#water&zippy=%2Cclean-your-bands%2Cwater-and-scratch-resistant-materials%2Cclean-your-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch help page</a>.</p><p>Google also recommends that you take the Pixel Watch 3 off after a water activity and dry it off before putting it back on, as a wet watch and band can cause skin irritation and erode the watch&apos;s protective layer in the long term. </p><p>Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 doesn&apos;t have a MIL-STD-810H rating for protection against drops or impacts. Google warns that an impact could damage the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s protective layer, eventually letting water in that could damage its inner components. Otherwise, that water-resistant layer could still fade over time, depending on how often you go swimming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wwpNckjnXR6Ypxvx97g8Uh" name="google-pixel-watch-3-morning-brief-starting-screen.jpg" alt="Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wwpNckjnXR6Ypxvx97g8Uh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of cleaning your Pixel Watch 3, Google says using warm, fresh water is recommended, but not to use the following in case they damage its protective coating:</p>
<ul><li>Hot water</li><li>Hand soap</li><li>Body soap</li><li>Dish soap</li><li>Hand sanitizers</li><li>Cleaning wipes</li><li>Household cleaners</li><li>Other similar cleaning products</li></ul>
<p>If you have a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, that&apos;s the best option for cleaning and drying your Pixel Watch 3, as it won&apos;t scrape away the protective layer. You should also remove your leather or metal band before using water to clean your Watch 3.</p><p>Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-waterproof-smartwatches">best water-resistant smartwatches</a> can withstand more punishment than the Pixel Watch 3, it&apos;s still a well-protected watch, and all of these precautions apply to other, more rugged watches, too.</p><p>Otherwise, if you do buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">Pixel Watch 3 bands</a> besides the default Active silicone band, you may want to consider whether or not they&apos;re water-resistant as well. </p>

<p>The market for flip phones is fairly small in North America, but it&apos;s growing with new options in both the high-end and low-end. Samsung and Motorola are at the forefront of this growth, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Razr 2024 are at both ends of the price spectrum.</p><p>These phones are fairly similar in some ways, but very different in many. This is pretty evident given they&apos;re targeting different price points, with Motorola giving consumers a more "affordable" entry into foldables. Samsung&apos;s Z Flip 6 is one of the most powerful flip phones on the market, but it means you&apos;ll pay a pretty penny for it.</p><p>So, which phone should you consider for your next (or first) flip phone? Lets compare, and hopefully this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Motorola Razr 2024 comparison will help you choose.</p>

<p>Similar to comparing the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024, the design differences between these two phones are just as stark. Samsung takes a more angular approach to its flip phone, with flat glass panels and sharp corners. It&apos;s very much a refinement of previous models of the phone and maybe the best design for the flip series yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> borrows its design from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>. It&apos;s nearly identical to its predecessor, with rear panels that curve into the rounded frame. The phone is also covered in vegan leather on the rear, with a strip on the front above the cover screen.</p><p>The differences in design also mean a difference in comfort. The matte frame and glass on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> feel great, but the sharp corners will dig into your fingers, depending on how you hold the phone. It can be quite uncomfortable the longer you hold it. Meanwhile, the Razr 2024 is much easier to hold for long periods of time, as the soft vegan leather and rounded frame are just easier on the fingers.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">offers the Galaxy Z Flip 6 in four main colors</a>, with an additional three colors that are exclusive to Samsung.com. The colors are more pastel, which some may not like, depending on your taste, but they are still quite nice. Motorola offers the Razr 2024 in three colors, including a rather striking Sprits Orange, but the Beach Sand and Koala Grey colors are a bit dull in comparison. However, Koala Grey makes up for it with the unique suede feel, which is rather nice, almost like you&apos;re touching an animal&apos;s fur.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that water resistance on both phones means they can be fully submerged, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">IP48 on the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> beats out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-2024-waterproof">IPX8 of the Razr 2024</a>, thanks to the added dust resistance.</p>

<p>As for the displays, this is where the phones are a bit more similar, even more so than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and Z Flip 6. Samsung&apos;s phone has a smaller display at 6.7 inches, but both are OLED, have Full HD+ resolution, and run at a variable 120Hz refresh rate. The Razr 2024 has a bit of an edge with a higher 3000-nit peak brightness, but the difference is fairly minimal, and you should have no trouble viewing both phones outdoors.</p><p>Thanks to improvements to the hinge and display designs, the display crease is also minimal on both phones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="X2eLY4uwqHLyRbAncrNp4i" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-hero.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 on a blue table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2eLY4uwqHLyRbAncrNp4i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2158" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These phones are targeted at different price segments, so the hardware and specs will reflect that. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a high-end flip phone featuring the most powerful Qualcomm chip to date, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. As a result, it performs incredibly well, handling apps and games without issue, thanks in part to the 12GB of RAM. This also lets it handle AI features, which we&apos;ll get to in the next section.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 features a new mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek Dimensity 7300X</a> with 8GB of RAM, but don&apos;t let that fool you. The phone also performs well, although it may not exactly hold a candle to the Z Flip 6. Games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Every Crisis are playable at the highest settings, and the phone is also capable of running some AI features, although not as fast or as well as the Flip.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 has the upper hand with storage capacity, since Samsung offers a 512GB variant of the phone, although you&apos;ll pay more for this. Motorola only offers 256GB, and neither model supports expandable storage.</p><p>As far as audio, both phones support Dolby Atmos with dual stereo speakers, but the Razr 2024 sounds a bit unbalanced due to one speaker being noticeably quieter when playing content. Overall, you&apos;ll get a better audio experience with Samsung, but neither are phenomenal.</p>
<p>The battery life situation between the two is pretty comparable. Both phones will last throughout the day, depending on how you use them, although you will likely need to charge up before the end of the night. The Z Flip 6 charges at 25W, and the Razr 2024 at 30W, so speeds are pretty similar, and both have the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-support-wireless-charging">wireless charging speed</a>. The main difference is that the Z Flip 6 supports reverse wireless charging, although its usefulness is still up for debate.</p>

<p>If you read our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 vs. Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> comparison, then you&apos;ll have a good idea of how the cover screen experience compares between these two phones. Samsung reaffirms its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">focus on the panel/widget experience</a> as the focus of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen, offering a more curated experience for users. Panels work fine, are presented well, and even have added functionality now that you can add multiple widgets to a panel. However, Motorola continues to excel in the cover screen experience, which extends to the Razr 2024.</p><p>Out of the box, you can set up panels, similar to what you can do on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. In addition, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">set up and use apps on the Razr 2024 cover screen</a>, just as you can on the Razr Plus 2024. The larger 3.6-inch OLED panel gives apps plenty of room, although the UI is still a bit scrunched, and you&apos;ll have to maneuver around the cameras. It&apos;s very easy to use the Razr 2024 without needing to open the phone, even when it comes to other aspects of the cover screen, like responding to notifications, changing wallpapers, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it&apos;s possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a>, Samsung makes you go through hoops to make it happen. In addition, the cover screen experience is far from perfect, although apps work well when you get them to work. Still, there are many interactions that will require you to open the phone, which can be a little frustrating.</p><p>Overall, you&apos;ll have a better experience with the Razr 2024, as Motorola has upgraded the cover screen quite a bit, and the external OLED panel also just looks better, thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate and higher resolution. This is a huge win for this mid-range flip phone over Samsung&apos;s flagship.</p>

<p>Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, but the software experience is very different. Samsung&apos;s One UI continues to grow, and the company focuses on adding more AI experiences with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. Samsung has seemingly gone all-in and even includes some Google features you won&apos;t find on the Razr, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. This elevates the software experience quite a bit, especially when on-device AI is involved, allowing you to keep your data private.</p><p>Many of Samsung&apos;s features are useful, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>, and some are just fun, like Sketch to Image and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-portrait-studio-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Portrait Studio</a>. Interpreter Mode also received a handy upgrade that takes advantage of the flip phone form factor, presenting translations on the cover screen to help make in-person conversations easier when speaking to someone in another language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8wP77xhu63ZQZzubTXvQH6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-08.jpg" alt="Generative AI sketch on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wP77xhu63ZQZzubTXvQH6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, Motorola&apos;s new Hello UX isn&apos;t a huge departure from previous versions of the software, but there are some notable changes to the UI, including the settings menu and the new Control Center with a modern Quick Settings panel. Some AI features let you create new wallpapers, but they don&apos;t work very well.</p><p>The phone shares some AI camera features with its flagship sibling, but others, like Action Shot, are missing. You do have access to some Google features, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>, which is available on the cover screen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a>. Also, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, the phone also has access to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> and Photo Unblur. Motorola has also teased some interesting Moto AI features in the works, but those are not yet available. Still, the software is perfectly fine, so long as you can deal with less frequent updates.</p>

<p>The camera comparison between these two phones is pretty cut and try. Both Samsung and Motorola gave their respective phones improved 50MP dual camera systems, but Samsung has the upper hand when it comes to image quality. It could have something to do with the ISP or just the way the algorithms produce images, but photos from the Razr 2024 tend to oversaturate scenes or punch up the brightness a bit too much. By comparison, images from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 appear much more natural, even when taken with the ultrawide cameras.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="470" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=0fa6598e-59ef-11ef-9396-d93975fe8866"></iframe>

<p>The Razr 2024 also oversharpens images, as if it&apos;s trying too hard to capture and retain detail. By comparison, images from the Z Flip 6 are much softer while still having plenty of detail. You can tell the difference from the images of the building below, which I&apos;ve cropped so you can get an even better idea of what I mean:</p>

<p>Both phones can shoot 4K60 video and Auto Camcorder mode. They also have various shooting modes, although Samsung takes the cake with the addition of Expert RAW, for users that really want to take their photography to the next level.</p><p>Overall, neither camera is perfect, and I would probably prefer the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 over both, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 easily beats out the Razr 2024.</p>

<p>Between the specs, price, and camera performance, it&apos;s clear that these are two very different phones for very different people. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is for those of you who want the best of the best and are willing to spend a little extra for it. The Razr 2024 is for those of you who are maybe just dipping your toes into the world of foldables, or maybe it&apos;s not your first foldable, but you just don&apos;t want a phone that&apos;ll break the bank and can get by with the basics.</p><p>Despite being more of a mid-range phone, the Razr 2024 still has a lot going for it and performs well above its weight. It also looks and feels great, with one of the best cover screen experiences you&apos;ll find on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>, second only to the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Samsung didn&apos;t change much with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, but it didn&apos;t really need to. It&apos;s a refined phone with the latest chip, a slightly better camera, and better battery life. Unfortunately, the cover screen experience still needs some work.</p><p>If you can manage the splurge, go with the Galaxy Z Flip 6. However, if you want to save, go with the Razr 2024.

While that allowed the Chinese manufacturer to build an initial following, it needed to focus on the mid-range and budget categories to cater to a mainstream audience, and it started doing just that with the introduction of the Nord back in 2020.</p><p>It would be an understatement to say that the debut of the Nord series has catalyzed OnePlus sales globally; the mid-range portfolio now makes up an overwhelming majority of the company&apos;s sales, and allowed it to shoot up the ranks in key markets, particularly North America.</p><p>It&apos;s no wonder, then, that OnePlus launched 18 models in the Nord series until now. Whether it&apos;s the mid-range powerhouse that is the Nord 4 or the entry-level Nord N30, OnePlus has a Nord device to cater to every need — and budget — so let&apos;s take a look at the best Nord phones you can buy now.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p8DHGqQ3agQPzk2WZqCgB7" name="oneplus-nord-4-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8DHGqQ3agQPzk2WZqCgB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> I used all year, and a big part of its allure is down to its all-metal chassis. Most manufacturers got comfortable with metal-and-glass designs in recent years, so it was refreshing to see OnePlus go back to a metallic chassis on the Nord 4, and it absolutely makes a difference in daily use.</p><p>The rest of the hardware isn&apos;t all that bad either; the AMOLED panel is vibrant, there&apos;s a huge 5500mAh battery with 100W charging, and it has decent internal hardware — gaming wasn&apos;t an issue on the device. But where it truly excels is the cameras; the Nord 4 is able to deliver striking images, and that gives it a distinct edge in the mid-range segment.</p><p>The Nord 4 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/oneplus-nord-4">available in India for ₹32,999</a> ($393) for the 8GB/256GB variant, and there&apos;s also a 12GB/256GB model that costs ₹35,999 ($429). Over in the U.K., the phone costs £429 ($559) for the 12GB/256GB edition, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-4">£479 ($624) for the 16GB/512GB model</a>. OnePlus doesn&apos;t sell the Nord 4 in North America, and customers in the region don&apos;t have an official way to pick up the device.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t need the latest hardware? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-3-long-term-review">Nord 3</a> still has a lot to offer, and it can be had for a lot less than the Nord 4. It doesn&apos;t have that elegant all-metal chassis, but the glass back combined with pastel hues makes it look good in its own right.</p><p>It has the same 6.74-inch AMOLED panel, but it doesn&apos;t get quite as bright; it is still decent enough, and I didn&apos;t notice any issues in outdoor use. The Dimensity 9000 is great in day-to-day tasks, and it holds up just as well at gaming. The 50MP camera at the back is very good too, and while it is outmatched by the Nord 4, it is among the better sensors in this category.</p><p>The biggest reason for getting the Nord 3 is the value; the 8GB/128GB model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Misty-Green-128GB-Storage/dp/B0C7V7VH6Q/">down to just ₹20,999 ($250) in India</a>, and that&apos;s a downright bargain for the hardware you&apos;re getting. The phone isn&apos;t as good a deal in the U.K., where the 16GB/256GB <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-3-5g">model costs £379 ($494)</a>, and you should consider the Nord 4 instead. But if you&apos;re in India, the Nord 3 is a viable choice. And just like the Nord 4, the Nord 3 isn&apos;t available officially in North America.</p>

<p>OnePlus says the CE in the naming of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce4-review">Nord CE 4</a> stands for Core Edition, and that the device is designed to deliver the essentials at an affordable price point. The Nord CE 4 is decent enough, and it has a good design with a big battery, 100W charging, and the 50MP camera takes good photos.</p><p>But the phone will get just two platform updates, and that makes it a poor choice against the likes of the Nothing Phone 2a. If anything, I think the Nord CE 4 Lite is a better choice to consider, and that phone is a better value, particularly in the U.K., where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-nord-ce4-lite-5g">costs just £249 ($324)</a> for the 8GB/256GB model. While the phone is also available in India, you shouldn&apos;t buy it — the Nord 3 costs about the same, and you get better hardware.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> is an interesting device; it is the only phone in the Nord portfolio that&apos;s sold in North America, and while it doesn&apos;t have the same great hardware as the rest of the devices on this list, you get a great value. The phone has a 120Hz LCD panel, a 5000mAh battery with 50W charging, and there&apos;s a 108MP camera at the back that takes good photos.</p><p>The design and hardware is rather basic, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Charging-Chromatic/dp/B0C22BRGLG">phone costs just $249 on Amazon</a>, and judging by its sales figures, it is one of the best-selling devices in this category. It won&apos;t get software updates and doesn&apos;t have the brightest screen, but if you just need an entry-level phone that nails the essentials, the Nord N30 is a good choice.</p>
