<p>The COROS PACE Pro's standout feature is its new AMOLED display, but it also added a new satellite chipset, redesigned GPS antenna, and an "improved watch body design for more accurate HR" than past COROS watches. I decided to put these GPS and HR enhancements to the test against a high-end Garmin watch and a Polar H10 chest strap.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-announces-pace-pro-first-amoled-running-watch">COROS PACE Pro</a> has other upgrades over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a>, such as a faster CPU, bigger buttons, better maps, and significantly longer battery life. However, the accuracy upgrades matter more to me: In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">cheap fitness watch accuracy test</a>, the PACE 3 lost to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> significantly for GPS accuracy and slightly for HR accuracy.</p><p>I gave the budget PACE 3 a pass, but the PACE Pro competes directly against more mainline running watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a>, and Polar Vantage M3 — with AMOLED displays and other niche perks COROS lacks — so there is less room for error.</p><p>Thankfully, the COROS PACE Pro (mostly) lived up to the challenge, holding its own against the much more expensive Garmin Fenix 8.</p>

<h2 id="coros-pace-pro-accuracy-test-summary-2">COROS PACE Pro accuracy test summary</h2>
<p>Since I'm reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and COROS PACE Pro simultaneously, I completed several long runs wearing both in low-signal areas, track runs at near-max heart rates in specific lanes, and tree-occluded hikes with plenty of elevation changes.</p><p>For GPS accuracy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> with multi-band GPS have traditionally done excellently, winning my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">Coros vs. Garmin vs. Polar fitness test</a>. The Garmin Fenix 8 is predictably accurate, but I haven't found it <em>more</em> accurate than the $450 Forerunner 265 or $350 Forerunner 255. So, the high-priced Fenix 8 is a fair GPS baseline for the $350 PACE Pro to match.</p>

<p>For HR accuracy, I typically use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM</a> as an optical baseline, but since it pairs automatically to COROS watches on the same account, I used my Polar H10 chest strap paired to my Fenix 8 to test the PACE Pro. I have fewer points of HR comparison than GPS because I paired the COROS HRM to the PACE Pro for a few runs to prepare for my Fenix 8 review.</p>

<p>I'll go more in-depth in both areas below, but if you're in a hurry, here are my main impressions: I see a definite improvement in GPS accuracy, bringing it functionally in range of Garmin so that no one will mind the gap. For HR accuracy, I <em>don't</em> see a significant difference, and I'd probably buy the COROS HRM if I needed the best possible HR precision.</p>
<h2 id="coros-pace-pro-gps-accuracy-2">COROS PACE Pro GPS accuracy</h2>
<p>For standard runs on city streets, the COROS PACE Pro (mostly) did very well. In the gallery below, you'll see how the PACE Pro (<em>blue</em>) does better than the Fenix 8 (<em>orange</em>) at matching my path on sidewalks or bike lanes during a long 12-mile run — but has a few moments later on where COROS has me running through lawns while Garmin has my correct sidewalk position.</p>

<p>In one instance, you can see how both watches captured me running into a little park to take a photo of a cool John Muir statue before backtracking a bit. COROS has me wandering into the street on the way out, while Garmin has more trouble on the return trip. In other words, neither is perfect, but both do excellently at finding me in tree cover and never lose me for long.</p>

<p>During a second city run, COROS (now the orange line) loses more visibly to Garmin, consistently showing me slightly misaligned from my actual trail or sidewalk position. It didn't have any real impact on my tracked distance, however, with no wobbling location or lost signal like you typically see with poorer connections.</p>

<p>Hikes can be the most challenging for tracking: tree cover and nearby hills can block or redirect signals, and any wrong lines can mess with your elevation tracking. Thankfully, both watches did well during an 8.5-mile hike. In the gallery below, you can see how COROS (<em>blue</em>) and Garmin (<em>orange</em>) overlap one another in uncovered areas and stay parallel and on-path in occluded areas. Their overall altitude gain was only 4m apart, too.</p>

<p>Overall, it's clear that COROS' redesigned antenna and new GPS chipset paid off. COROS' GPS accuracy on past watches has been good but not the best. With these tests, COROS has done exceptionally well or has done well enough to stay in lockstep even when the results aren't quite perfect.</p>
<h2 id="coros-pace-pro-hr-accuracy-2">COROS PACE Pro HR accuracy</h2>
<p>The latest COROS watches have five LEDs and four photodiodes, meant to capture a wide swath of your wrist for reliable HR data. In this case, COROS said the PACE Pro would have improved accuracy thanks to a redesigned body, but the results themselves look fairly comparable to past COROS watches.</p><p>I used my Polar H10 chest strap for comparison. Even though I've had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">issues with its accuracy in the past</a>, I'm hoping it provided a reliable baseline.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1848px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="cJ6D3awAnFT4LNfC4iwXHL" name="COROS-PACE-Pro-heart-rate-chart-jog" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the COROS PACE Pro and Polar H10 chest strap compare for heart rate accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ6D3awAnFT4LNfC4iwXHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1848" height="1040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first chart above shows a straightforward 3-mile run. The COROS PACE Pro stays fairly close to the Polar H10 — which is connected to my Garmin Fenix 8, hence the label — but if you look closely, you can see how the COROS' optical monitor lags slightly behind Polar's electrocardiogram, not catching every minor change and showing slightly lower. That's normal for an optical vs. ECG comparison; so far, so standard.</p>

<p>For my long hike, there are long stretches where the COROS watch and Polar strap are in near lockstep with one another. Then you have moments where COROS measures a heart rate about 10–20 bpm above what the chest strap measures. I've had issues with my chest strap losing my signal in the past, dipping my HR to unlikely lows, so I'm uncertain if this is the fault of COROS or Polar here. The overall HR average was only one bpm off across a 2.5-hour activity, so I tentatively chalk this up as a solid entry for COROS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1848px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="qpX25rqqnEVPzSNkvMDrGL" name="COROS-PACE-Pro-heart-rate-chart-track-workout" alt="A heart rate chart showing how the COROS PACE Pro and Polar H10 chest strap compare for heart rate accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qpX25rqqnEVPzSNkvMDrGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1848" height="1040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The track workout is, predictably, where the problems arise. The COROS PACE Pro struggles to capture quick changes in heart rate, falling anywhere from 1 bpm to 8 bpm short at all times.</p><p>This is a pretty common weak point for most watches — a lack of responsiveness when running in a high-aerobic or anaerobic HR zone — but I hoped COROS would improve in this area. Instead, you get a 2 bpm gap in average for a relatively short activity.</p><p>That's why, as I said above, I'd probably recommend buying the COROS armband to pair with this if you need the best possible results. For everyday runners who aren't doing that many sprint activities or just need to know generally what heart rate zone you're in, the PACE Pro gets my stamp of approval for being generally reliable for heart rate.</p><p>And to be fair to COROS, other watches I've tested during track runs do significantly <em>worse</em> for anaerobic accuracy, even if it isn't the best I've seen.</p>

<p>When it comes to picking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, every brand has its strengths and weaknesses. The COROS PACE Pro won't change your mind if you already dislike COROS because the software is largely unchanged. It's a <em>hardware</em> upgrade meant to catch up to the pack in some areas and improve its lead in others.</p><p>The AMOLED facelift aligns with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">industry-wide abandonment of MIP</a>, making it long overdue. The accuracy boost is also an important one, targeting the kinds of runners (like me) that don't take a watch's workout results on blind faith; we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/sf-half-marathon-distance-controversy-shows-need-for-accurate-gps-watch">notice when the results are wrong</a>, and so COROS is taking GPS and HR accuracy seriously.</p><p>On the software front, COROS has the essentials: a target weekly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> based on your current fitness level, a monthly distribution of easy/medium/hard effort, a running fitness test to determine your lactate threshold, and downloadable training plans.</p><p>It still has weak spots, but COROS updates all of its watches with new features so long as the CPU can support them; since the PACE Pro has a new CPU and extra RAM, it should receive support for years to come. Though for now, the absence of music streaming apps or contactless payments may be deal-breakers for some runners.</p><p>While I still need another week or two to fully test the PACE Pro for its review, I'm feeling very enthusiastic about its upgrades. It's pricier than the PACE 3 but still on the cheap side compared to other running watches. Frugal "pros" should seriously consider it.</p>

<p>We can’t see the future. As much as we’d like to say that the Samsung Galaxy S25 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"></a>is a fantastic phone the bests anything the company and others have launched to date in the Android space, we don’t know this for sure just yet. The phone isn’t actually launching until the first half of 2025. If launch follows suit with the last two generations, it should he announced before the end of January. With that said, that’s only a few months away.</p><p>Knowing the Samsung Galaxy S25 will be the newest entry-level model in the line, likely accompanied by Plus and Ultra variants, that means it will go head-to-head with the Google Pixel 9, that brand’s newest entry-level model as well. So, we thought we’d take a speculative look with this Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Google Pixel 9 comparison, based on the unconfirmed rumors so far about the Samsung Galaxy S25. Seeing how these two phones <em>could </em>compare may help you start prepping for a decision.</p>

<p>We haven’t yet seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, but there have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">leaked renders</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design"></a>that suggest the phone will increase in size from the 6.2 inches of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review"></a>to about 6.36 inches, which is more akin to the size of the new Apple iPhone 16 Pro, while also being lighter.</p><p>It seems all three variants of the phone will also employ a similar shape with rounded edges, flat sides, and a flat front. The expectation is that the phone will have the same armor aluminum frame (titanium option for the Ultra variant) with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a>. It’s also expected that there will be a built-in S Pen, though the leaked render images don’t show one.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 will likely come with the same M13 OLED display. Brightness may still hover around 2,600 nits. Based on the leaked renders, the camera set-up may be similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review"></a>which resembles a traditional DSLR camera lens with ribbed edges and thick borders.</p><p>Regarding other specs, these have not been confirmed, but assuming this phone would at least match the Samsung Galaxy S24, we can say at the very least that the display will be FHD+ with 120Hz refresh (or better), and storage options may include 128GB and 256GB. Since the Galaxy S24 has an IP68 rating, it’s safe to assume the Galaxy S25 will have at least that as well.</p><p>When it comes to the battery, it should be at minimum 4,000mAh with support for both wired and wireless charging. Some leaks, however, indicate that the battery could be as large as 5,000mAh. One area that we hope is improved upon is wireless charging speeds: the Galaxy S24 still taps out at 15W and considering so many other phones support much faster wireless charging, it’s time Samsung caught up in this department.</p><p>As for finishes, sources claim these may include Moon Night Blue, Silver Shadow, Sparkling Blue, and Sparkling Green for the standard Galaxy S25 variant.</p>

<p>How does this compare to the look and feel of the Google Pixel 9? Already available now, it comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Wintergreen, and Peony. It has a 6.3-inch screen which, if rumors are correct, would make it about the same size as the Samsung Galaxy S25. Its Actua display boasts 2,424 x 1,080 resolution with a refresh rate from 60-120Hz and 2,700 nits peak brightness.</p><p>With rounded corners and square design that Derrek Lee says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">his review of the Pixel 9</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review"></a>that the polished back with a satin metal frame is “surprisingly comfortable to hold.” The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and it boasts an IP68 water and dust resistant rating with a fingerprint-resistant coating.</p><p>It comes with 128GB or 256GB storage and a large 4,700mAh battery that’s a big step-up from the Samsung Galaxy S24 and could be the same if Samsung doesn’t improve on this with the Galaxy S25. There’s also an Extreme Battery Saver mode that can extend battery life to up to four days. The Google Pixel 9 supports both fast and wireless charging as well, along with Battery Share for using it to refuel other devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review"></a>Lee is impressed with the battery life, saying the phone easily lasts through an entire day with up to eight hours of screen time. But he does find the 27W charging to be “almost unbearably slow.”</p><p>A huge advantage with the Google Pixel 9, and all recent Pixel devices, is that Google promises <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS and security updates</a>. Samsung offers the same for the Galaxy S24, and it’s safe to assume this will extend to the Galaxy S25 as well.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9-the-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Google Pixel 9: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison. Keep in mind that these specs for the Samsung Galaxy S25 are not yet confirmed.</p>

<p>There’s a lot yet we don’t know when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of the Samsung Galaxy S25. But based on the leaks, renders, rumors, and the specs of the current generation Samsung S24, this is our best guess as to how the comparison might look.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1413px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="34pEszLi7EfbpK34zsgNUQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="An alleged look at a rendering of the vanilla Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34pEszLi7EfbpK34zsgNUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1413" height="795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s get down to what’s truly important: processing power and features. The Samsung Galaxy S25 was initially thought to be powered by the "Snapdragon 8 Gen 4" chipset. And while that's technically true, some of the latest rumors suggest it might actually come with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (essentially a rebranded chip), marking an even bigger jump in performance thanks to the Oryon cores. That said, other rumors suggest Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-models-to-opt-for-flagship-exynos-soc-again">may stick with its in-house Exynos chip</a>s.</p><p>One thing to note if it does use the Snapdragon is that it could mean the Galaxy S25 requires a bigger battery to be able to accommodate all this power. Even if a bigger battery is part of the equation, the end result could be shorter overall battery life, slower charging to accommodate the enhanced power and processing, or a wash in terms of battery life between the S24 and S25. But again, this is all speculation. Plus, some rumors indicate that there could be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">new AI battery feature</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature"></a>that works to conserve up to 10% of the battery life through each day.</p><p>We do know that the Samsung Galaxy S25 will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, the latest version of the operating system, and this will be paired with Samsung’s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">One UI 7.</a> It appears that this version of the Samsung UI may be one of the biggest upgrades yet with a new visual style, additional customization options, new icons, and more. Some report that there will be new aminations as well, akin to OnePlus’ parallel processing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>.</p><p>Of course, it goes without saying that the Samsung Galaxy S25 will come with all the same AI features you get with the Samsung Galaxy S24 through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. The belief is that these features will be further enhanced in this new phone, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak">more parental control features</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-one-ui-7-samsung-parent-ai-features-leak"></a>This is something parents of tweens and teens who monitor their phones will appreciate.</p><p>Keep in mind that this OS update should be available for Samsung Galaxy S24 owners as well, and a beta is reportedly going to launch before the end of 2024. Once it does, those who gain access will effectively be getting a preview into what the experience will be like with the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dHVLUYzGncvcn5sxANM3G7" name="google-pixel-9-fitbit-app-today-view.jpg" alt="Today View in Fitbit app on Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dHVLUYzGncvcn5sxANM3G7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Google Pixel 9, it comes out of the box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, but of course it’s updateable to Android 15, and far beyond. It’s powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4</a> processor and has 12GB RAM, making it a powerful phone that can handle multi-tasking, video streaming, gaming, and more. Lee says it performs well when opening and juggling apps, and he never noticed the phone getting warm when playing especially intense mobile games.</p><p>It, too, has plenty of AI features through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> that range from advanced Google Assistant to photo editing, message composition, and more. It comes with plenty of security features like Google VPN and end-to-end encryption along with safety features like satellite SOS, emergency SOS, car crash detection, and more.</p><p>How these two phones compare when it comes to operability will really come down to two main things: does the Samsung Galaxy S25 have more powerful processing, and how much does this impact battery life? In the end, however, both devices will likely count among the most powerful phones you can buy.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9-how-good-are-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Google Pixel 9: How good are the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4001px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.78%;"><img id="yLhXfijjR842Rp9mMWegd6" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-09.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLhXfijjR842Rp9mMWegd6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4001" height="2672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera experience is crucial for most phone users. These are the memories you capture daily that you’ll likely keep for a lifetime, not to mention share with the world through social media.</p><p>There are rumors that there will be some big changes to the cameras in the Samsung Galaxy S25. Notably, the belief is that Samsung will shift entirely to using Sony sensors. Samsung hasn’t historically made sweeping changes to its cameras since the Galaxy S22 jumped from a 12MP main sensor to a whopping 50MP. And we expect that the Samsung Galaxy S25 won’t be too far off from the Galaxy S24.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24, as a refresher, has a 50MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide camera, 10MP telephoto camera, and 12MP selfie camera. We’re guessing the Samsung Galaxy S25 won’t be too far off from these numbers. However, some rumors do indicate the possibility of a massive jump with a 50MP ultrawide camera and a new telephoto lens that has variable capabilities, either relating to zoom or aperture.</p><p>The Galaxy AI features will extend to the camera experience as well with all the same cool photo and video capturing and editing features crossing over to this phone as well. In terms of any new features that will be added to the experience, we’ll have to wait and learn about those later.</p><p>Google likely has nothing to worry about, whatever the case may be, as the cameras in the Google Pixel 9 are pretty darned good. Lee says the images are “detailed and crisp” with a “great deal of dynamic range, even in low lighting conditions.” The Pixel 9 has a 50MP main camera as well with a wide sensor that affords up to 8x Super Res Zoom. Its ultra-wide camera is an impressive 48MP with macro focus but the front “selfie” camera is a measly 10.5MP. Lee does miss the third rear telephoto camera, which the Samsung Galaxy S24 has and the Galaxy S25 may continue with as well.</p><p>A similar set of photo editing features using AI are found in this phone as well, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Best Take (a fan favorite that lets you choose the best expressions of each person from multiple version of the same group photo to create the “best” one), Photo Unblur, and more. There’s even a cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature for editing and enhancing videos.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-18.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 on a plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a “right now” decision, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24">Google Pixel 9 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24"></a> comparison since the Samsung Galaxy S25 isn’t coming until early 2025, likely by the end of January. If you are willing to wait, then it’s time to weigh the decision based on what you know so far.</p><p>Looking at the Google Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy 24, those two devices are pretty close in almost every respect. The Pixel 9 has more RAM and a slightly higher resolution screen than the Samsung Galaxy S24, while the Samsung Galaxy S24’s ultra-wide camera is much lower resolution. If Samsung rectifies all three of these downsides in the Galaxy S25, it would be an even closer race.</p><p>Considering how close we are to the Samsung Galaxy S25 launch, it’s a good decision to wait if you’re looking to upgrade from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Samsung Galaxy S23</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review"></a> or earlier phone and trying to decide if you should stick with that camp or opt for a Pixel phone instead. Once you’re armed with all the confirmed specs and details, you can make the most educated decision.</p><p>With that said, if you’re desperate to upgrade and need something now, maybe even want to take advantage of Black Friday and holiday deals, the Google Pixel 9 is and will continue to be one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"></a>you can buy for some time. The Samsung Galaxy S24 makes that list as well, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 will probably eventually take its place. It all comes down to whether you can bite your nails and wait just a little bit longer to get it.</p>

The Android 15-based update for the OnePlus 12 is a shining example of what a company can achieve when it realizes its past mistakes and resolves to fix them.</p><p>Now, OnePlus is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update">elite few companies</a> that have pushed an Android 15 update out to its phones in less than a month after Google released the OS. Meanwhile, companies like Samsung are saying not to expect its Android 15 beta release for another month, followed by the full release of One UI 7 sometime early in 2025. I would have lost money if I had to wager a bet against which of these two companies would have had its Android 15 update out first.</p><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> user, I'm glad OnePlus got its act together and has been able to deliver such a monumental update in such a short amount of time. OnePlus 12<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review"></a> users can expect to see the update appear on their phones this week, while other OnePlus phones should get the update in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>That's one of the many reasons the OnePlus 12 is a phone you need to consider picking up during Black Friday this year. We've already seen great sales on this phone just this week, with the phone on sale for $649. But if you're willing to wait just 3 weeks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-oneplus-deals">Black Friday OnePlus deals</a>, I think you'll be able to get it for even cheaper.</p><p>I've reviewed well over a dozen phones this year, but the one I keep coming back to is the OnePlus 12. Here's why I think you'll love it, too.</p>

<p>Speaking of iOS, OnePlus joins the swath of OEMs that have added a Dynamic Island-style pop-up notification to the punch-hole camera in the display, but it's disabled by default. Right now, it doesn't seem to support many apps so it's probably not worth using outside of a few first-party OnePlus apps.</p><p>The new animations and optional frosted glass UI look are all quite beautiful and should please anyone who appreciates little details throughout the UI.</p><p>All of this ties in so perfectly with the haptics which have always been one of the real stars of the show when using the OnePlus 12. Move your finger along the brightness or volume sliders and each little notch is felt like you're moving a dial. Keyboard taps are punchy and deep. Unlocking with the one's excellent fingerprint sensor feels like pressing a button. It's all incredible, and it makes me love using this phone over others.</p>

<p>OnePlus phones rarely have the best cameras in the industry, but the OnePlus 12 has surprised me more than once with its unique Hasselblad color tuning engine and the excellent telephoto sensor on the back.</p><p>With that said, I wholeheartedly welcome the new AI features that work to make the camera even better. We already tested OnePlus' AI eraser and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-versus-magic-eraser">found that it was better</a> than Google's Magic Eraser, and now OnePlus is back with three other new tools I'll be using all the time.</p><p>AI Detail Boost can help fill in the gaps to make low-resolution images look crisper and cleaner, or just add some more fine detail to an image that's been zoomed into. This one's nice, but I like AI Unblur even better since it can help clean up some of my favorite blurry photos. Check out this comparison of my son and his friends during Halloween, for example.</p>

<p>There's also a reflection eraser tool that does exactly what it says on the tin, similar to the tool that shipped with Samsung phones in 2023.</p><p>Lastly, a new global search app uses Google Gemini to locally catalog anything you give it permission to, including photos, messages, contacts, and more. It's not <em>quite</em> as robust as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots app</a> on a Google Pixel, but it can be helpful for quickly finding photos, videos, or messages on your phone without switching between a bunch of apps.</p><p>OnePlus also upgraded the multitasking to make it more like the brilliant OnePlus Canvas software that debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. Floating windows now support gestures, the smart sidebar can be used like a desktop dock to launch apps, and switching between apps is faster and smoother than on any other phone, thanks to OnePlus's brilliant UI design.</p><p>There are a lot of other little <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">things we've been loving about this update</a> and all of them culminate into an experience that's better than any other phone on the market. I keep coming back to this phone time and time again despite having access to every other Android phone on the market, and I think you will find the same joy if you pick one up for cheap during Black Friday this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>To understand how the tech landscape or anything else would function during a second Donald Trump presidency you first must understand Trump himself. Much ink has been spilled by people with various qualifications about Trump and his flaws, but I think it’s a lot simpler than people make it; Trump is purposefully divisive because he finds humor in the chaos it creates. The man wants to act the way he acts and it’s impossible to tell exactly what he thinks at any point in time. He will say anything to create controversy because he <em>desires</em> controversy. Many people love him for it.</p><p>This trait is also part of his political identity. You may love or loathe the man, but he wants you to manifest those emotions either way. He knows what to say and when to say it for maximum effect, and isn’t shy about it. You don’t know what Trump thinks because that’s not important to him and can change at the drop of a hat. He is the embodiment of the saying that any publicity is good publicity and his time in Hollywood taught him well.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>More importantly, he has learned how to surround himself with sycophants, some of whom <em>can</em> actually bring about change. Regardless of what you may think, the president is not in control of the price of gas or eggs and can’t make any laws. He can only sign laws that Congress has approved. Executive orders can have a limited effect, but the law of the land comes from Congress.</p><p>With Republicans controlling all three branches of government, expect change. Some change you may not like is bound to happen. But this Congress is unpredictable in a way we’ve never seen before because a sizable portion of the elected officials in both the House and Senate will do and say anything to curry favor with Trump and his ardent followers. Trump can say we should ban TikTok on Monday and change his mind on Wednesday. But if Congress bans TikTok on Tuesday to appease Trump, it’s not undone easily. Trump understands that he can act the way he acts, but Congress <em><strong>must</strong></em> be clear on what is best for the country versus what is said for amusement.</p>
<p>A good example would be Trump’s relationship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/twitter-x-could-start-charging-users-subscription-fees">Elon Musk</a>. Today, the two seem to share some common goals and we should expect both to profit from the relationship in some form or another. Much of this will affect U.S. consumers and give Musk’s ventures more leeway and lax oversight. However, this relationship can change at any time because of Trump’s (and Musk’s, to an extent) unpredictable nature. Next week Musk could be the villain Trump, and by association, those who follow him in Congress, want to punish.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.83%;"><img id="Urn3rqngFkZFEkcxyCF5eP" name="tesla-launch.gif" alt="A Tesla driving away." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Urn3rqngFkZFEkcxyCF5eP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ve no doubt read about what to expect for tech companies under Trump across the internet from some reputable sources. My inbox is full of pitches, ideas, and interview offerings from experts on the matter as well.</p><p>I say they all may be right. Also, they all may be wrong. There’s just no telling what we should expect in the future because even the “people in charge” don’t know what to think in the future; Trump hasn’t <em>told</em> them what to think yet.</p>
<p>I’m not saying any of this as someone who opposes (or endorses) the idea of a second Trump presidency; to me, the man is no better or worse than any other successful politician. I’m not a Republican, Democrat, or even an Independent. If I have to apply a label to myself, I’m a Defeatist; I think a ruling class has inserted itself into politics in a way that you either submit and enjoy the enrichment that comes along with it or don’t get elected. Ideally, sowing division among the electorate is the goal to keep anyone who disagrees from ever gaining popularity. Ignoring his personal life, Trump is no better or worse than any other successful politician on the national stage, he's just different. Going by the 2024 election results, plenty of people prefer this sort of governing.</p>
<p>Not counting any personal grievances that make their way into American politics, expect a second Trump term to look a lot like any other administration where Republicans control the government: more friendly to companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, fewer consumer protection laws successfully introduced to Congress, and a short period of economic growth followed by a hard recession. We have the blueprint of how this works, which is readily available.<br><br>As examples, in 2019 DoJ anitrust division head Makan Delrahim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html" target="_blank">actively lobbied regulators and lawmakers</a> to ensure the deal between Sprint and T-Mobile was successful. The Trump administration FTC's lone successful antitrust decision against Qualcomm was sullied when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/the-doj-and-other-federal-agencies-oppose-the-ftc-in-ftc-v-qualcomm#:~:text=At%20that%20time%2C%20the%20DOJ,Department%20of%20Defense%20(DoD)." target="_blank">DoJ intervened against the FTC</a>, filing a motion that defended Qualcomm. Delrahim recused himself from this case as he was the outside counsel for Qualcomm prior to his position with the DoJ.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://futureplc.slack.com/archives/C05GZMFJ160/p1731092471289349"></a></p>

<p>I would not be surprised to see Google prevail in its current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">antitrust cases</a> under a new FTC, Amazon dodges any similar charges, and Meta continues its lawful-evil ways without any oversight. The executives of these companies may decree a Trump presidency as a travesty, but money doesn’t lie and plenty of it will continue to change hands with all levels of the administration, just as it would had Harris defeated Trump.</p><p>Expect Biden’s Executive Order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ftc-fight-against-ai-scammers-why-it-matters">governing AI</a>, which Trump has pledged to repeal, to disappear. With noticeable support from many of the companies covered under this order, there should be little outcry from the tech sector. Congress will also resist creating any new AI regulation.</p>
<p>On the question of tariffs, under the law, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/"><u>only Congress has the authority to implement them</u></a>. That didn’t stop Trump from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods or Biden expanding them and economists claim there are loopholes that could be used to apply new tariffs on foreign goods.</p><p>Don’t blindly believe that we’ll be paying hundreds more for tech products because the companies that make them have plenty of influence on lawmakers. Nobody will pay $1,400 for the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S</a> so that simply won’t be the price. Any tariffs and their effects will be mitigated <em>somehow</em>. Let’s hope the solution doesn’t wreak havoc down the road.</p><p>While societal norms and individual rights are going to change, I predict the tech landscape to go mostly the same way it always has, both in the U.S. and abroad, favoring the wealthy donor class over the consumer.</p>

According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">report from Counterpoint Research</a>, Google's smartphone shipments grew 20% in Q3 2024, which can be attributed to the much earlier launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p><p>A second report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america/#monthly-202310-202410">Statcounter</a> shows just how drastic Pixel growth has been, with a graph revealing a jump from about 5% to a whopping 14% share between September and October. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series went on sale at the end of August, when there was a noticeable uptick in share, giving Google a good amount of time to see the Pixel 9 affected Q3 sales figures. It's worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> did not go on sale until Q4 2023.</p>
<p>While Google still has some catching up to do to reach the numbers of Samsung Galaxy phones, it's clear that the company's strategy is working. The Pixel 9 series has have been impressive thanks to great cameras, standout designs, a better chipset, and fun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> features.</p>

Now, OnePlus is getting in on the action by rolling out OxygenOS 15 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, the company's current global flagship (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> is still China-only for now). Some Android Central staff have already received the update, which is steadily arriving on global variants of the phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1723669843116294150">update</a> brings a host of visual improvements to the home screen, themes, and animations and should make things more fluid and uniform throughout the UI. The pulldown menu can now be separated by notifications and quick settings, similar to iPhones and some other Android phones. There's also a new Live Alerts feature that mimics Apple's Dynamic Island by showing real-time updates for apps and activities in an expandable pill at the top of the display.</p><p>There are a ton of new updates, but Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda has highlighted some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">his favorite OxygenOS 15 features</a>.</p>

The device, as hinted by the name, would be a thinner model, but that apparently might not mean that it'll be a watered-down version. A recent leak suggests that despite its thinner profile, the phone may feature an "Ultra" camera.</p><p>While the leak doesn't specify what that means, it's not hard to guess that it could adopt a 200MP camera similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and previous Ultra models. If true, it'll be interesting to see how this will fit in the phone; will it feature a massively protruding camera sensor? We don't know how "slim" this phone will be, but it may likely be thinner than the current batch of Galaxy S24 models, which come in at 7.6, 7.7, and 8.6mm for the S24, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>, and S24 Ultra, respectively.</p>

<p>It's also being said that if the Galaxy S25 Slim does launch, it won't arrive with the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, which is expected in January. That said, it's not clear when Samsung is planning to launch the device if it does end up coming to market.</p>

With Amazon well aware of the issue, the company is working on a fix and noting that owners can contact customer service and request a replacement or refund. That said, replacements may take some time to arrive as Amazon works on fixing the screen tint issues, although there's no word on the dark mode issue.</p>

<ul><li>The 'Saved' tab is being replaced by an 'Activity' tab that brings everything together in one place, including search history from Chrome and the Google app.</li><li>The update will simplify things by creating a single spot for your search history and saved items, instead of having them scattered across different tabs.</li><li>The change is in a limited test phase, with only a few users getting it so far, and has been in development for the past two months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s working on a new feature to make accessing your search history and saved items easier right from the main app.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-app-activity-tab-3497741/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google’s main app is getting a big update. The current "Saved" tab will be swapped out for a new "Activity" tab that pulls together all your saved items in one spot. Furthermore, it’ll give you easy access to your search history from both Chrome and the Google app.</p><p>At present, checking your History on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> and the Google app can be a hassle, with information spread across different tabs. That said, with this experiment, Google is making that job easier by creating a unified spot to access both your search history and saved items.</p><p>Google is rolling out the new feature as a test, with only a limited number of users getting it so far. According to Android Authority contributor Assemble Debug, it’s been in the works for the past two months.</p>

<p>The new "Activity" tab gives you a seamless, app-based experience instead of a web view. Plus, you’ll be able to easily save, share, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-delete-your-recent-google-search-history-on-android">delete history items</a> right from the app.</p><p>A Telegram user, @andrey4ik21pro1_q, found the new 'Activity' tab on their Pixel 8 Pro with Google app version 15.44.25.29.arm64. However, it seems that the feature wasn’t available on another Pixel 8 Pro running a newer version of the app.</p><p>The feature is expected to roll out more widely in the coming weeks, so users should be able to access it soon.</p>

Best Buy's not making anyone wait that long, as its early Black Friday deal is already underway. And as part of one of the first "Doorbusters," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p?skuId=6587911"><strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been discounted</strong></a> to its lowest price ever!</p><p>When I wrapped up my review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I just assumed that I would swap my SIM card back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Surprisingly, that hasn't been the case, and the 9 Pro Fold remains right by my side every day. And at the very least, I implore you to try out Google's latest foldable phone for yourself, especially considering that it's $300 off.</p>

<p>If that comes as a surprise to you, you're not the only one. Samsung has a more robust software experience, while also doing a better job with handling aspect ratios. But there's just something about the 9 Pro Fold that keeps me coming back.</p><p>Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that this is basically the phone that I hoped Google would've released as a first iteration. While the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> offers a neat design, it's far from refined. However, the 9 Pro Fold solves practically all of my complaints from last year, with a few added benefits.</p><p>I've spoken about this a few times, but as someone who is a first-time father, I've quickly learned that sometimes I need a bit of help to get my son's attention for a picture. The one feature that I keep coming back to is "Made You Look," which not only gets my son's attention but usually makes him smile.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-made-you-look.jpg" alt="Made You Look on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ig2feRhJcB7YDn6fLWTRMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's already come in handy more times than I can count, and with the holiday season rapidly approaching, I suspect this number will grow exponentially. Not to mention that the 9 Pro Fold will also probably act as the "group family picture" camera, as it's easy to prop it up, set a timer, and snap the picture after I jump in.</p><p>But in the event that I'm not actually able to get in the picture, Google has the solution for that. Although I don't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and the various AI features all of the time, I know that they're ready for whenever I am. This includes the "Add Me" feature, so I can snap a picture of the family, then have someone else take one of me, and just add me to the shot.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not the perfect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, but I don't even know if such a thing exists. There are trade-offs to be found, no matter what phone you end up deciding on. But one thing I know for sure is that if I didn't already have the 9 Pro Fold, I'd be picking one up.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest major AI venture has exited testing and it becoming available for more Workspace users.</p><p>The company highlighted the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available.html">general availability</a>" of its AI-backed video creation app, Google Vids. The post states users can "easily build" videos by leveraging its AI model Gemini for assistance. The app has generative AI features through its new "help me create" button. One standout function of Google Vids is its selection of templates.</p><p>Clicking "help me create" will reportedly produce Gemini's assistance based on your work. Google states its AI software can suggest a "script" for use or to serve as inspiration.</p><p>The templates Google alluded to are "use-based," meaning Workspace users may find the design they prefer to use in ads, meetings, and more. On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15082957">support page</a>, the company states that users can find these templates within the sidebar. These templates deliver a frame from which users can build off of. Google states users can choose different animations, transitions, and more.</p><p>The post adds that users will find a built-in recording studio when creating videos. From there, Workspace users can record themselves, a narration, a screen recording, or audio. However, Google Vids leans heavily on AI assistance, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/15067217?sjid=16528034210924596463-NC">Gemini can create a voice-over</a> for you. The company states this feature is available at the bottom of the script panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:898px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.82%;"><img id="PRitbPmiLYfDLxaGoYKj6b" name="google-vids-general-access-workspace-rollout" alt="Google Vids starts arriving for more Workspace users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRitbPmiLYfDLxaGoYKj6b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="898" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google then extends a warning to Workspace users interested in the Vids app. While it is expanding to "select" subscription plans, "AI-powered features like 'help me create' and AI voice-overs" remain free until December 31, 2025. The company states a "limit" may be applied to such features by 2026, but it will provide a follow-up alert around that time if it's happening.</p><p>The Google Vids expansion includes Workspace Business (Standard/Plus), Enterprise (Standard/Plus), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/11/google-vids-now-generally-available-for-edu.html">Education Plus</a>, Essentials, Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus. Moreover, a Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, or Education Premium add-on will find Google Vids.</p><p>The feature has started making its rounds and its rollout should be completed within 15 days.</p><p>Google first debuted its Vids app for Workspace during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-cloud-next-2024-gen-ai-announcements">Cloud Next 2024</a> event in April. This was followed up with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/we-tried-google-vids-the-new-ai-powered-video-generator-in-workspace-labs">testing phase</a> that kicked off this past summer. The company detailed Google Vids as an AI-backed tool to assist with generating storyboards alongside a wealth of editing/stylizing options. What's more, Gemini was stated to offer more suggestions when you can't decide between stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Additionally, Google Vids provides a "View and Collaborate" function. This lets other users (with a Workspace account) come in and work with you on a project. There is an option to "create and copy;" however, Google states this is available to "select editions."</p>

I adore its size and the fact that it comes in a wide array of unique color options. Luckily, this already-affordable outdoor speaker usually costs around $80, but this pre-Black Friday deal brings it down to a lowly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CTP56C5R"><strong>$49.93 on Amazon</strong></a> for a limited time.</p><p>JBL is famously reliable in the audio accessory world.

There are nine different patterns and colorways to pick from, including a cool cameo print which is perfect for the outdoors.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Photos app to help users stay in the loop with all the latest happenings.</p><p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/306428786?hl=en">a community post</a>, Google is rolling the new "Updates" page in Photos for all users on Android and iOS. This new page is being touted as a shared, social hub for people who share photo albums with one another. Accessible via a new "bell icon," users will find an Updates page that places organization and what's current first.</p><p>Google states it hopes the Updates page can "foster collaboration and connection." This is designed to be a user's one-stop-shop for updates on shared albums and conversations/group conversations. Regarding the latter, the post states users will be notified if they're added to a new conversation or if another user sends a new photo. All conversations are accessible via the Photos app settings.</p><p>For shared albums, Google says its Updates area will inform you of new ones and display them in the order received. Moreover, if another user adds a new picture to a shared album, an alert will be sent so you can check it out. However, users can hop into their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections tab</a> to view their shared albums without seeing ongoing conversations and "other activities."</p><p>Other information in this new page include partner sharing, memory, and storage updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8" name="google-photos-2022-dark-mode.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7oZELqNnLeYv5dpEJwHvU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google highlights the "chronological" order of the Updates page. Albums received/shared will be displayed by "today" first, before diving into "yesterday, this week, this month" and more.</p><p>As previously stated, the Updates page in Photos is rolling out today (Nov 8). The company states that users can continue to check for an update "over the coming weeks."</p><p>Speaking of the "Collections" tab, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">the "Library" tab revamp</a> for the app over the summer. Instead of that old carousel, users were presented with a more organized grid for their cloud-stored albums. The company also shifted the Locked Folder button down into a list, instead of being displayed as a larger pill-shaped button up top.</p><p>With the "Updates" page arriving, we're still waiting on the official rollout of the app's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature. Google Photos will soon let users conversate with an AI to discover photos they're having trouble locating. "Ask Photos" leverages the company's AI model Gemini to process your "descriptive query" and (hopefully) find what you're looking for. Google highlighted the feature in September, stating users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/#ask-photos">join its waitlist</a> to try it out before it launches.</p>
