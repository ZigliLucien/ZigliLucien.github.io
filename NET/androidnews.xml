                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It hasn&apos;t been that long since I reviewed the original RingConn Smart Ring, but the company is already out with the second generation, which improves on the first in some key ways. This new RingConn Gen 2 has battery life that bests just about any other smart ring on the market and even rivals some fitness smartwatches. Plus, it has a really useful sleep monitoring feature that you won&apos;t find on too many devices, hoping it stands apart from the pack. </p><p>But compared to smart ring giants like Oura and Samsung, can RingConn carve a sizeable piece of the smart ring pie, or will its efforts go unnoticed by consumers? Either way, the company has a compelling device that somehow improves on its already impressive first-gen smart ring, and some other companies in the smart ring race should probably look to this latest RingConn model as something of a standard for their own efforts.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h7wSEx6e4hHUYQbT8xNgoR" name="RingConn-Gen-2-review-01.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on a gray surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h7wSEx6e4hHUYQbT8xNgoR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2059923007/ringconn-gen-2-ultimate-lightness-12-days-battery">available for preorder via Kickstarter</a> and goes on sale in September via the company&apos;s website. The device will likely retail for $299, only $20 more than the previous model, and come in three different color options: Future Silver (glossy), Royal Gold (glossy), and Matte Black (matte).</p><p>If you preorder on Kickstarter, you&apos;re able to grab the ring for as low as $209, depending on the pledge you choose, each of which come with different perks.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-what-i-like"><span>RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LH9Pcmv5HFaurrMrD9svtk" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-12.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on a finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LH9Pcmv5HFaurrMrD9svtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is identical to the first model, and that&apos;s definitely not a bad thing. I was really impressed with how RingConn designed its smart ring, which is more of a squircle shape than an actual circle.</p><p>Like other smart ring models, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring comes in a few different finishes, about the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-color-samsung-galaxy-ring-should-you-buy">what Samsung offers</a>, with gold, silver, and black options. I have the silver model with a fairly glossy finish, which I&apos;m normally wary about, given how my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring</a> scratches pretty easily, even when I put a cover on it. But the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has fared surprisingly well, and I haven&apos;t noticed much in the way of scuffs or scratches in the couple of weeks that I&apos;ve tested the device. As careful as I try to be with my Oura Ring, it&apos;s somehow a magnet for scratches no matter what I do. </p><p>Of course, all the sensors are located on the inside. While this mostly follows the exterior squircle design, the bottom has a flat surface where you&apos;ll find many of the main sensors. This looks like it would make the ring uncomfortable to wear, but surprisingly, it doesn&apos;t. </p><p>RingConn says the Gen 2 Smart Ring is both thinner and lighter than the first generation, which is surprising given the battery life claims of this device. Speaking of, the ring lasts 10 to 12 days on a single charge, which is more than what Samsung or Oura claim for their smart rings. In my use, I would say this is pretty accurate. I&apos;m honestly surprised to see how little battery life is used up at the end of the day, even when tracking workouts. Of course, your battery life will depend on the ways that you use the ring, including how often you track workouts and take advantage of the ring&apos;s newest feature, which I&apos;ll get to in a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EZkSVq6HJxWAQtpv55hTG4" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-16.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring app showing remaining battery life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZkSVq6HJxWAQtpv55hTG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And just like the first generation, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring comes with a charging case, which makes it fairly convenient to carry around as opposed to a charging dock that needs to be plugged in. The case has a 500mAh battery that you can charge separately, and RingConn even has a separate charging dock you can purchase separately, which has cool light indicators to show you the battery level of the ring.</p><p>Another thing you can purchase for the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is a cover, which is surprisingly uncommon for smart ring manufacturers to offer. Even Samsung doesn&apos;t have one for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>, which I find odd, so I commend RingConn for thinking of this. There are times when I will take off the ring, but I prefer to keep it on because I have a tendency to lose them easily. Therefore, having a cover makes it easier to handle things without worrying too much about damaging the ring. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4223px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U9juc77NibmPfGLJXRa46V" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-04.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with app widgets on the cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U9juc77NibmPfGLJXRa46V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4223" height="2375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the actual ring, the app experience is also fantastic. While it doesn&apos;t offer everything I&apos;d want in a smart ring app, it has a great layout that makes information very easy to view at a glance. There are only three tabs, so it&apos;s very easy to navigate.</p><p>Nowhere in the app will you find an option for a subscription, unlike some other companies that pretty much require it for their most useful functions/insights, or will hide it and surprise you with a "subscribe to use this" banner when you want to check out a certain future.</p><p>Widgets are also a nice touch and something I&apos;d like to see from more smart ring manufacturers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-health-tracking"><span>RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: Health tracking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wUVmFPyfMTnVZMtxfxez9G" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-03.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with the companion app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUVmFPyfMTnVZMtxfxez9G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to fitness and health tracking, The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring covers the basics that you&apos;d find on just about any other smart ring. The ring tracks your heart rate, sleep, blood, oxygen levels, stress, and even your skin temperature. This is pretty much par for the course on a smart ring, and as far as I can tell, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring does pretty well that much of it. You can dive into each metric in the app to view detailed data on your sleep, heart rate, etc., and your trends for each metric.</p><p>You can also track several different workouts, such as outdoor running, indoor running, outdoor cycling, and outdoor walking. Smart rings aren&apos;t exactly known to have extensive exercise/sports modes, although RingConn says it&apos;s working on bringing more diverse options to the app.</p><p>You won&apos;t get a readiness score like you&apos;ll find with Samsung and Oura, but you get a more graphical representation of essentially the same thing. The app will show you a graph of your sleep, vital signs, activity, and stress management and how they compare to the previous day. I honestly think I might like this better. It&apos;ll also tell you which areas you can improve on and how you can improve them, and you can dive more deeply into the scores for each individual metric.</p><p>For example, with sleep, you get a sleep score, which factors in all the variables such as your sleep efficiency, your time asleep, and more. I like that it also shows you the optimal intervals for your sleep stages and where you fall short. Unfortunately, there <em>have</em> been a few times when I&apos;ve taken a random nap during the middle of the day, and the app won&apos;t log it, even though there&apos;s a section in the sleep metrics dedicated to naps. I can always add them after the fact, but I rarely remember when I fell asleep or woke up since I&apos;m not scrambling to log my nap immediately after waking up.</p>

<p>Smart rings are getting better at counting your steps, although no device is perfect. The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is kind of hit or miss in this area. There are times when I found its steps to match closely with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>, for example, but then there are other times when the Gen 2 Smart Ring is way off. I haven&apos;t noticed much in the way of phantom steps where it&apos;ll somehow calculate that I&apos;ve taken thousands of steps while I&apos;ve been mostly sedentary, but when I am out and about, sometimes it&apos;ll under or over-calculate the steps I&apos;ve taken.</p><p>You can see some of the results in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-vs-smartwatches-step-counting-test">smart ring step test</a>, in which I wore a few different rings and two smartwatches while walking 5,000 steps. The RingConn performed pretty poorly in these specific tests, but again, I found that there are times when the steps closely match those of my Garmin smartwatch, which does a pretty good job tracking my steps.</p><p>Still, I find you should take smart ring step counts with a grain of salt.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WHdukSAeXnrUsnJwqbJFRB" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-vs-Oura-Ring.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring and the Oura Ring Gen 3 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WHdukSAeXnrUsnJwqbJFRB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring and the Oura Ring. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the newest feature on the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: sleep apnea monitoring. For the uninformed, sleep apnea is a disorder that may cause you to stop breathing while you sleep, which is not good for some pretty obvious reasons but can severely disrupt your sleep and ultimately lead to some serious health conditions.</p><p>RingConn claims that the Gen 2 Smart Ring is the first smart ring to detect sleep apnea. It does this by using an AI-advanced OSA detection model to pinpoint moments when there are interruptions in airflow and decreases in blood oxygen levels while you sleep. According to RingConn, its model is 90% accurate, although the company is awaiting FDA approval.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting feature that you have to manually enable before you go to sleep to ensure that the app remains active. When you wake up, you stop the monitoring, and the app analyzes the information, displaying the results on an AHI index bar. This will show you the number of apneas or hypopneas per hour during sleep, as well as the total number of events during the monitoring duration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-05.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring app sleep apnea monitoring feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cabCsi8Y5Cvf6VmfGN7a5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t suspect I suffered from sleep apnea, and the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring assures me that I have nothing to worry about. However, while RingConn notes that this feature is not a diagnostic tool and that you should seek medical attention if you feel unwell, I can see how this feature can help people who may suspect they suffer from sleep apnea or are trying to improve what has already been diagnosed.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s senior editor, Andrew Myrick, discovered that he himself might suffer from sleep apnea, which is why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature" target="_blank">he was so excited</a> to see this feature arrive on the recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch</a> models. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">not everyone enjoys wearing smartwatches to bed</a>, so something like the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring would be ideal in a situation like this.  </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-what-i-don-t-like"><span>RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3777px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8ALVFyLPLf5nqABgDaw295" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-15.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring balanced on its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ALVFyLPLf5nqABgDaw295.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3777" height="2125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sleep apnea feature is pretty cool, but there are some downsides. Firstly, it won&apos;t start automatically; as I mentioned, you must start and stop the feature manually. I don&apos;t know about you, but when I&apos;m tired, I can barely remember to charge my phone, let alone open an app and tell it to start monitoring for a specific condition. I&apos;m sure if you suspect you suffer from it or you know you do, you might be a little more inclined to remember, but I kind of wish there was an option for this to happen automatically once the ring detects you&apos;re asleep like an automatic option that you can toggle on or off. </p><p>But the second downside, which is why I can see how my suggestion may or may not work, is that sleep apnea monitoring drains the battery by quite a bit. And not just from the ring, but from your phone as well. On a regular night when you&apos;re not monitoring sleep apnea, you lose 2-3% of the Ring&apos;s battery life as it tracks your sleep normally. However, when you turn sleep apnea monitoring on, you&apos;ll lose about 10% or more depending on how long you sleep and how long the app is monitoring. </p><p>The plus side is that the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring has amazing battery life, so it kind of balances out, especially if sleep apnea is not a concern for you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3624px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="h4Biwhs5D4QKeh9u9hDPgY" name="RingConn-Gen-2-smart-ring-review-06.jpg" alt="The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4Biwhs5D4QKeh9u9hDPgY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3624" height="2038" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I do wish the exercise tracking was a little bit more robust. One of my favorite things about the Oura Ring is that it can automatically track certain exercises and activities, but it&apos;s all manual with the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring. Even after a long walk or run, the app will at least show that you&apos;ve done something to elevate your heart rate, drastically increase your steps during a certain time, and burn a ton of calories. It all points to something happening, but the app won&apos;t actually say what happened unless you manually track the workout.</p><p>And this one&apos;s asinine, but like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-smart-ring-review">first-generation RingConn Smart Ring</a>, I wish the charging case was smaller. With as much battery life as you get from the ring, having such a large charging case just seems like overkill, especially when you look at the case included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>. Hopefully, RingConn adds this as an additional accessory that you can purchase separately.</p><p>Lastly, I wish the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring synced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> on Android and not just Google Fit. However, iPhone users will benefit from Apple Health connectivity.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-competition"><span>RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3519px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ww9b9sCfhcZeUAmRZvB8VK" name="Oura-Ring-Gen-3-heritage-silver.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ww9b9sCfhcZeUAmRZvB8VK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3519" height="1979" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RingConn&apos;s biggest competitors are Oura and Samsung. The Oura Ring pretty much popularized a smart ring category, and the ordering continues to be one of the best smart rings on the market. It has great battery life, a very insightful app, automatic activity tracking, and it syncs with Health Connect. The downside is that it still relies on a monthly subscription when most other smart rings are subscription-free. This drives up the overall cost over the lifetime of the device, while the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring remains a cheaper option, even up front. </p><p>The Galaxy Ring is Samsung&apos;s first smart ring, which means that Samsung has a larger user base to appeal to since it&apos;s part of the Galaxy ecosystem. There&apos;s also no subscription here, and you get access to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which powers insights like the new energy score. However, as noted in our Galaxy Ring review, there are some growing pains since this is Samsung&apos;s first smart ring, with mediocre sleep tracking, gimmicky gestures, and various limitations on non-Samsung phones.</p><p>Another favorite is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, which offers pretty advanced features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">AFib detection</a>—the first smart ring to do this. You get a pretty comprehensive set of health tracking features, although the app experience is pretty poor, and you&apos;ll have to pay more upfront for the ring, plus extra if you want the headlining AFib detection feature.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're in the market for a fairly affordable smart ring.</li><li>You don't want to pay a subscription for access to features.</li><li>You think you might suffer from sleep apnea.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want more robust exercise tracking/automatic workout detection.</li><li>You want accurate and reliable step counting.</li><li>You already own the first gen.</li></ul>
<p>Smart rings are becoming a hot new wearable category, especially now that Samsung is in the ring, so to speak. RingConn may not have the same brand power as some of the giants, but the company has a solid offering that does the basics quite well. In fact, with the impressive battery life and sleep apnea feature, the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring manages to achieve some feats that we&apos;ve mostly seen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">smartwatches from Garmin</a> or Samsung, and it&apos;s more than capable of holding its own against the best smart rings on the market.</p><p>The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is one smart ring that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked, as it offers great value for those who want to take charge of their health.</p>

Most phones have powerful chipsets that deliver standout performance, but because of overheating issues, these chipsets tend to throttle aggressively. Manufacturers are essentially constrained by the size, so the most they can do is add a vapor chamber to passively cool the chipset on a phone.</p>

<p>ASUS came up with a novel solution called the AeroActive Portal on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-6-pro-review">ROG Phone 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-review">Phone 7 Ultimate</a>; this was basically a small hatch that opened up on the side of the phone, allowing cool air to flow into the heatsink when used in conjunction with the AeroActive cooler. The idea was innovative, but it led to a lot of mechanical complexity, and ASUS doesn&apos;t offer the feature on its latest phones.</p><p>But if the latest solution by xMEMS is any indication, active cooling may just be possible on mobile devices. At a high-level overview, xMEMS&apos;s XMC-2400 is a micro-cooling fan that&apos;s just 1mm thin, and like the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds-with-solid-state-audio-drivers-are-about-to-go-mainstream">solid-state audio drivers</a>, it uses an all-silicon design.</p><p>Basically, xMEMS uses a voltage-controlled transducer to move the fins of the fan fast enough to generate a considerable amount of airflow. The XMC-2400 is able to deliver 39cc/sec airflow and 1,000Pa back pressure, and crucially, it is IP58 dust and water resistant, allowing it to be used on sealed devices like phones. It is available in two variants: top-vented or side-vented configurations.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5p3U-xMlJ58" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The fan measures just 9.26 x 7.6 x 1.08 millimeters, weighs less than 150 milligrams, and consumes roughly 30mW of power. The tech has a lot of similarities to Frore System&apos;s AirJet system, but it is considerably thinner, and xMEMS is positioning it as a viable solution on phones as well as, tablets, VR headsets, notebooks, and gaming handhelds.</p><p>Because it has an all-silicon construction, it doesn&apos;t make any sound, and there&apos;s no vibration as it operates at ultrasonic frequencies. While the tech makes a lot of sense on larger devices like handhelds and notebooks, it remains to be seen how airflow is handled on a phone; most phones have fully sealed designs, and that poses a problem when venting hot air outward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zNG9UnJwsMf6woioNUYQhh" name="active-cooling.jpg" alt="xMEMS XMC-2400 silicon fan on US dime" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zNG9UnJwsMf6woioNUYQhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xMEMS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the AirJet system, Zotac added slits to the side of its mini-PC that serves as the exhaust, but it&apos;s unlikely that phone manufacturers will start doing the same on their devices to accommodate active cooling. There&apos;s also the cost to consider; the AirJet system has been around for nearly a year, but it hasn&apos;t secured many design wins.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="reYhX3ssi2EeFipHYTgGYh" name="active-cooling-2.jpg" alt="xMEMS XMC-2400 active cooling silicon fan" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/reYhX3ssi2EeFipHYTgGYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: xMEMS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s where xMEMS could have an advantage. As its solution is considerably smaller, it can be used in a wider variety of devices. And with xMEMS producing half a million solid-state drivers that go into the likes of the Creative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/creative-aurvana-ace-2-review">Aurvana Ace 2</a>, it has a proven track record. The brand notes that it will start seeding the XMC-2400 active cooling solution to clients starting 2025, with retail availability a year later.</p><p>While that&apos;s a lengthy wait, if phone brands actually manage to find a way to integrate active cooling into their devices, it has the potential to be a game-changer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Honor unveiled the Magic V3 in China in July, and the foldable is set to make its global debut at IFA 2024. Honor has confirmed that it will launch the device globally at its IFA keynote on September 5, but that&apos;s not all; the Magic V3 will be joined by the MagicPad 2, and the Magicbook Art 14.</p><p>I&apos;m excited to see what Honor has in store with the Magic V3; I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> quite a bit this year, and it remains one of my favorite foldables. Honor managed to deliver one of the thinnest foldable designs in the Magic V2, and it&apos;s building on that with the V3, which is thinner and lighter than its predecessor.</p><p>There are camera and battery tweaks as well, and with Honor positioning AI as a differentiator on its devices, the brand is likely to announce new features in this area at IFA. The biggest issue with the Magic V2 was availability; although Honor announced the foldable at last year&apos;s IFA event, it didn&apos;t go on sale globally until well into 2024, and that curbed its momentum. Honor needs to do better in this area with the Magic V3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-16.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic V2 RSR review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Magic V3 undoubtedly gets all the attention, I&apos;m intrigued by the MagicPad 2 as well; it has a massive 12.3-inch OLED panel, and goes up against the iPad Pro 13. There are plenty of Android tablets, most still use LCD panels, and you don&apos;t see OLED tablets outside of Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S series, so it&apos;s refreshing to see Honor target the high-end with its tablet.</p><p>Alongside the IFA keynote, Honor is hosting another event at the trade show that focuses on AI. I&apos;ll be on the ground at IFA, and will have more to share soon.</p>

<hr>
<p>Consumers are still left without proper repair options for Google&apos;s Pixel Watch series — even with the third iteration.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> offers a unique glass-domed design for its watch face that makes it prone to damage. The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-watch-3-cant-be-repaired-3472994/">Android Authority</a> inquired about repair options for Google&apos;s latest smartwatch, but the answer wasn&apos;t favorable.</p><p>A Google representative stated that if your Pixel Watch 3 comes under harm, you can "the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options."</p><p>As the publication notes, this information doesn&apos;t bode well for folks interested in repairing the device instead of grabbing a new one. An option like that would help consumers elongate the life span of their device, especially for an accidental scratch or a funky crown.</p><p>However, Google stated those interested in purchasing a Pixel Watch 3 are encouraged to grab Preferred Care. This device insurance will cover damages received, including "out-of-warranty issues." It&apos;s worth mentioning that if you are chasing a replacement device with the insurance, Google will ask for $49 in service fees.</p>

<p>Not that we were holding our breath, but Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-wont-repair-pixel-watch-displays">hasn&apos;t offered repair options</a> for its smartwatch since the beginning. Users had taken to Reddit to voice their displeasure as the only option then (and now) was to replace the device completely. Moreover, the idea of Google repairing the watch or doing it at home has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-teardown-video">previously proven difficult</a>.</p><p>Self-repair part provider iFixit conducted a teardown of the Pixel Watch and showcased its sheer lack of repairability. Cracking the screen and attempting to pop on a new one was tedious and there was no way to replace its crown or button. </p><p>Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-warranty-option">lack of repair options</a> continued with the Pixel Watch 2 as it (once again) encouraged consumers to purchase the Preferred Care insurance plan.</p><p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> on August 13 during its hardware event. The device debuted packed with loads of health and fitness tools that should have runners feeling pretty good — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">maybe a little depressed</a>. Nevertheless, the watch is offered in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm with an estimated 36 hours of battery time with "Battery Saver" mode enabled.</p>

<hr>
<p>The later we get in August, the closer opening kickoff is, which is why YouTube TV is detailing some new features.</p><p>One of the highlights that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/latest-nfl-sunday-ticket-features/">YouTube TV discussed</a> today (August 20) is the inclusion of even more fantasy football stats for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The company states that users can link their Yahoo Fantasy accounts alongside those with NFL Fantasy accounts to their Sunday Ticket.</p><p>Users can open the side panel (Scores & Stats) when watching a game to see tabs like Teams, Scores, Stats, Key Plays, and Fantasy. The final tab shows your fantasy team&apos;s current matchup, points tallied, and player performance. In-depth player details are available for each team and tapping on each one displays a full breakdown.</p><p>The post teases additions, such as the future availability for users to view "key plays and multiview combinations" involving their fantasy lineup.</p><p>Those with the NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV can find the new Fantasy tab on their TVs and mobile. Those with access through YouTube will pick this feature up later this season on mobile, tablets, and the web. When the season starts, users can connect their fantasy account under the "Sports" tab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9119412">in your account&apos;s settings</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.44%;"><img id="M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-fantasy-tab.jpg" alt="The NFL Sunday Ticket prepares to rollout a "Fantasy" team tab for stats and scores." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6pBpGZGwmjfi2j8zagn9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="991" height="599" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiview shifts ahead this upcoming season as users can now "build" their own custom experience. YouTube states Sunday Ticket holders can create two, three, or four-game combinations on gameday. Additionally, YouTube TV&apos;s base plan members can choose to view "preferred" multiview configurations, which are chosen based on what&apos;s "local."</p><p>The Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV will have this upgraded multiview available on TVs, mobile, and tablets. For YouTube, multiview on mobile, tablets, and TVs will be ready at the start of the season.</p><p>YouTube then teased a few smaller additions that will join the NFL Sunday Ticket for kickoff. Those additions include a spoiler mode to hide scores, more playback controls (broadcast delay), and a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-gets-new-last-channel-shortcut">jump to last channel</a>" shortcut.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1113px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.91%;"><img id="ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T" name="youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-custom-multview.jpg" alt="YouTube TV is bringing "build a multiview" to the NFL Sunday Ticket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELyBJMnAiBswaptFPxaj6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1113" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The video streaming service reiterated that football enjoyers (should) have access to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dual-column-tv-redesign-detailed">new TV UI redesign</a>. The company started rolling out this new dual-column approach earlier this year for YouTube TV subscribers.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/custom-multiviews-in-youtube-tv-let-you-pick-four-basketball-games-to-watch-at-once">build a multiview</a>" may sound familiar due to its rollout for the NBA League Pass and NCAA basketball in February. During its debut, YouTube stated users could browse and select from "four pre-selected games." The company explained that its custom multiview will try and have games available for you based on "expected" popularity.</p><p>This customizable multiview experience was said to grab additional live sports and it seems that&apos;s getting underway with the NFL in 2024. Sunday football starts September 8.</p>

<p>This doesn&apos;t sound like a big deal, especially since the products themselves all have plenty of plastic parts, but it is. Plastic wrapping, trays, and inserts inside a box are the kinds of things that get thrown away as soon as you tear into the package. There is no real value in keeping them around because you don&apos;t need them to send a product in for a warranty claim.</p><p>Using plastic could be a good idea because it&apos;s almost infinitely recyclable. Unfortunately, it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/why-is-it-cheaper-to-make-new-plastic-bottles-than-to-recycle-old-ones/">more cost-effective to create new plastic</a> than it is to recycle it for many purposes — plastic can get ugly when recycled and some things need to look pretty. Especially when it&apos;s next to an expensive new phone like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-preorder-deals">Pixel 9 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Google did this. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-its-first-carbon-neutral-products/">Apple</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/sustainability/sustainable-materials/">Samsung</a> are working towards the same goal, and each says it should be able to make it happen by 2025. Apple and Samsung also sell about a bajillion more phones and other products every year than Google does. Google was able to do it earlier because it simply has fewer boxes to consider. I assume it&apos;s more cost-effective to use plastic because every company does it, and saving money is just as important as selling products, especially when you sell a lot of products.</p>

<p>Google switching from plastic to recycled paper products won&apos;t have as big of an impact as Apple or Samsung. It&apos;s still very important, though, because this brings the issue into focus. When consumers realize that this is a small change that&apos;s really good for the environment, companies like OnePlus, HMD, and others will look into doing the same. When enough smaller companies join Google, the amount of plastic being used will be far less, so less of it will end up sitting in the dirt at the landfill. </p>
<p>You should care about this. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-4-what-smartphone-sustainability-really-looks">Sustainability</a> is important because we have to live on this planet. We have to eat the food grown here, drink the water found here, and breathe the air here. We also raise our kids here, and nobody should want to leave things worse than we found them.</p><p>Companies like Samsung committing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-2022-sustainability">using recycled materials</a> in their phones is super important and we should appreciate those kinds of efforts. Smaller goals can be equally important and since they should be easier to pull off, we should expect them. </p>
<p>I&apos;m no hippie guy who wears only hemp and has a Save the Whales bumper sticker on my truck. But I do hunt, fish, and have a vegetable garden. I also have grandkids and I want this place to be as clean and healthy as possible for them to grow up in. </p><p>Sustainability should not be some tribal left vs. right or us vs. them issue. It should be something everyone can support, and we should all want to see what else Google and every other company can do to make Earth a better place.</p>

<ul><li>Meta first-party studio Camouflaj revealed the first gameplay trailer for Batman: Arkham Shadow during Gamescom 2024 Opening Night.</li><li>It shows similar combat, enemy stalking, gadgets, and Detective Vision as the previous Arkham games.</li><li>The trailer also shows boss battles, traversing the world using a grappling hook, and familiar faces like Harleen Quinzel and Jim Gordon.</li><li>Batman: Arkham Shadow launches in October 2024, exclusively on Meta Quest 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After months of hints and a story trailer, Meta studio Camouflaj has shown off what it&apos;ll be like to step into a young Batman&apos;s boots and fight the mysterious Rat King. Turns out that a VR Batman LARP should be pretty darn fun!</p><p>During opening night at Gamescom 2024, we saw the official Batman: Arkham Shadow gameplay trailer (embedded below). In it, we see a first-person perspective on the traditional Arkham fight formula: Batman must whale on foes while dodging attacks and using gadgets to maintain his combo and earn more XP. </p><p>Since you don&apos;t have a birds-eye view anymore, Camouflaj shows a flashing arm symbol when Batman senses an attack coming from the side. And to attack foes, you&apos;ll have to match your controller attacks to the fist or arrow symbols that appear. You also see colorful flashes after hard punches, as well as tactical moves like the Batarang and grappling foes towards you.</p><p>In other words, you&apos;re no longer just tapping buttons and feeling invincible; you&apos;ll have to move skillfully to keep Batman alive.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dadLtfngQH8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Equally exciting, the Arkham Shadow gameplay trailer showcases the series&apos; famous Predator mode, where you lurk above the fray and must silently take out armed enemies one by one. We see glimpses of the player grabbing and choking foes, as well as hogtying and dropping foes off of gargoyles.</p><p>In-between battles, it appears you&apos;ll be able to freely traverse the world, running and leaping over gaps or grappling to new areas. The world itself doesn&apos;t look as open as Arkham City or Knight, matching closer to Asylum in its claustrophobic environment. That probably matches more closely to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>&apos;s processing power.</p><p>Despite the mobile VR headset&apos;s limitations compared to, say, a PS5 or Xbox Series X, the trailer graphics look fantastic compared to many Quest games. It explains why the game won&apos;t work on the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a>, which lacks the hardware power for a game this large and immersive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for non-VR fans of the franchise, Arkham Shadow — which takes place between Arkham Origins and Arkham Asylum in the series timeline — won&apos;t be available on standard consoles. The gameplay is wholly designed for motion controls and VR, so you&apos;ll need a Quest 3 headset to experience it. </p><p>This has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/fans-complain-about-batman-arkham-shadow">angered some long-time fans of the franchise</a>, especially after Rocksteady&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> turned into a live-service experience. It looks like Arkham Shadow will capture the old single-player, story-driven Arkham Asylum experience far better.</p><p>Based on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-story-interview">interview with Arkham Shadow&apos;s project leads</a> back in June, the game took inspiration from popular non-fighting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Quest games</a> like Beat Saber for its rhythm mechanics and Superhot for its time dilation. The goal is for the player to experience the "flow" of fighting as Batman, leaping from one enemy to the next and never getting caught out.</p><p>According to the developers, Batham: Arkham Shadow will be "the longest game Camouflaj has ever made." The gameplay trailer shows plenty of interactive cutscenes with famous Batman characters that will likely pad the runtime, as well as finding collectibles throughout the world.</p><p>The trailer ends by commanding you to "Become the Knight" once Arkham Shadow launches in October 2024. Any long-time series fans with a Quest headset will probably obey that command, as the trailer makes the game look extremely fun.</p>

<p>Earbuds with ear hooks are my jam! Their secure fit works well for my lifestyle, so I tend to gravitate towards them. The Skullcandy Push ANC Active has a great fit and is quite comfortable. The ear hooks don’t feel like they’re pushing into the back of your ears, and the hooks are thin enough that they don’t feel awkward when I’m wearing glasses.</p><p>I also like the mix of physical buttons and touch controls on the buds, both of which are responsive when you interact with them. You can access physical rockers on both earbuds, which control volume, track forward, and track back. Then, there are the touch controls on the skull area, which control play/pause and call functions.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the most important feature: the sound. These are good, all-around, everyday carry earbuds for those who lead an active lifestyle. They’re urban tuned, with bass hyped slightly, but not annoyingly so. Bass response is satisfying for an upper entry-level priced pair of buds. The issue I ran into was using the Bass Boost preset. Listening to bass-heavy tracks from my hip-hop workout playlists on Tidal, the Bass Boost preset caused distortion in the drivers. When I switched back to the Music preset, everything was fine.</p><p>With regard to the other frequencies, I found mids and highs to be well-presented and airy. These earbuds have a respectably sized soundstage, which was apparent when listening to the FLAC file of Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and the Tidal track “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” OST.</p>

<p>You’ll definitely want to take the hearing test found in the Personal Sound menu of the Skullcandy app (pictured in the gallery above) to get the best quality sound for your ears. If you still need to play a bit, the Custom setting on the Equalizer tile gives you a five-band EQ to further fine-tune the sound to your liking.</p><p>Overall, the Skullcandy Push ANC Active worked well for all of the genres I tried. From hip-hop to pop, folk, classical, and death metal, as I said at the outset, these are solid everyday carry earbuds.</p><p>ANC is decent at this price point. It effectively minimizes ambient noise in your environment, giving you some respite from low-frequency droning sounds like jet engines. However, you shouldn’t expect the level of noise-canceling you might get from some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-true-wireless-earbuds">best ANC earbuds on the market</a>, especially in the higher-end frequencies.</p>

<p>These earbuds have ANC and an Ambient mode. Though they&apos;re clear and people talking to you are audible, the Ambient mode can be tinny sometimes. They&apos;re definitely not the best I’ve reviewed, but they&apos;re serviceable.</p><p>For Skullcandy’s audience, I don’t think this is an issue, but the case is huge compared to some competing products I’ve reviewed lately. It won’t matter if it is in a backpack or attached outside of a backpack by a lanyard.</p>

<p>As I stated previously, it’s all about what you want. There are offerings at this price point that I think have better sound quality but aren’t as stable or don’t have wireless charging.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Nothing Ear (a)</a> sound better with their support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">Hi-Res Wireless Audio</a>, but are an AirPod-style pair of earbuds. They stay in my ears (AirPods don’t) but won’t be as “locked in” for dynamic gym use. It’s pretty much the same story with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC</a> with LDAC, but add in wireless charging.</p><p>Then there’s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/oneplus-nord-buds-3-pro-review">OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro</a> which are $20 less than the Skullcandy Push ANC Active and I’d say have somewhat better sound quality but, like the Ear (a) won’t be as locked in. </p><p>Call quality is good in a quiet space, and it&apos;s actually pretty decent in mild traffic, but the heavier the traffic noise gets, callers on the other end may experience dropouts in the audio. Wind noise may exacerbate that issue.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-them-2">Should you buy them?</h2>

<p>If you have the sort of lifestyle that requires ear hooks and you want relatively inexpensive earbuds with wireless charging, these are for you. However, you may want to steer clear if you&apos;re looking for something with support for Hi-Res audio, and the bulky charging case is definitely a bit of a turnoff, even if it does have wireless charging.</p><p>Overall, the Skullcandy Push ANC Active is a good buy for those needing a rugged everyday carry pair of earbuds. There are some tradeoffs at this price point where overall sound quality is concerned, but for gym use and commuting, these should fit the bill for many people.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sivga isn&apos;t a brand most of you will be familiar with, but the Chinese manufacturer is slowly gaining momentum on the back of wood-based designs and custom tuning. Of course, Meze did the same thing a decade ago, and the 99 Classics continues to be a standout product. I reviewed the 99 Classics last year, and it didn&apos;t take long to realize that it is one of the best-sounding headphones in the sub-$500 category.</p><p>Sivga is following in the same path, and the Luan shares a lot of similarities to the 99 Classics. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SIVGA-LUAN-Detachable-Professional-Audiophiles/dp/B0C6D7WY8Z">costs $299 on Amazon</a> — just $10 less than Meze&apos;s offering — and has dynamic drivers and a wooden enclosure that looks great. The key difference is that the Luan offers an open back design, while the 99 Classics is closed-back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6" name="sivga-luan-14.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3VmXfjXGTMPLWTjv3aX8i6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll get to the sound in a bit, but as always, let&apos;s start with the design. There&apos;s definitely a lot to talk about in this area, and the Luan stands out for its usage of wood; most products in this segment use a mix of plastic and metal, and there&apos;s just something inherently cool about headphones with a housing made out of wood.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4" name="sivga-luan-4.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ZxVd3dj9jT64y8hNqCDd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan is available in two finishes, and the walnut model I&apos;m using is sublime. Sivga did a brilliant job with the design, and what I particularly like is that the headphones are color-matched to the wooden housing, so the earpads and the headband have a similar color scheme. The end result is that the Luan looks striking, and the design is pretty distinctive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4" name="sivga-luan-5.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpUPwAKP9UvWtUUA8D3ds4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sivga also deserves credit for using no plastic in the chassis of the Luan; the headphones feature an abundance of steel for the swivel mechanism and the headband, and the build quality is exquisite. There&apos;s a good amount of swivel, and the external grille has a standard mesh pattern. Basically, the Luan doesn&apos;t look or feel like a pair of headphones that costs just $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5" name="sivga-luan-8.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P9KNdy34NLngqzCPEJnhN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wooden housing is sanded down and polished, and after two months of extended use, the Luan shows no signs of wear. The headband has a leather insert with foam padding that does a great job distributing the weight, and even though the Luan weighs 354g, it doesn&apos;t feel like it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7" name="sivga-luan-7.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbNE3LRF2y44Fdikwwy4i7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a decent amount of swivel to the earpads, and they&apos;re lined with velvet. The pads are large enough that there&apos;s no issue with sizing, and the foam inserts are extremely soft, ensuring they stay comfortable even after extended use. There isn&apos;t a lot of clamping force, and while the headphones have a snug fit, the plush pads ensure there&apos;s no fatigue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6" name="sivga-luan-12.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yC8cboPnLAmEdtk5nBsqS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Luan connects via two 3.5mm plugs, and the other end of the cable has a balanced 4.4mm connector. The bundled cable is of a decent quality, and like the rest of the design, it is also color-matched to the headphones. The Luan is bundled inside a hard shell carrying case made out of leather, and it is one of the best cases you&apos;ll see in this segment. It does a great job safeguarding the headphones, and it has feet at the bottom that allows it to stay upright.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5" name="sivga-luan-13.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KG4gL9udNNAddLuYVPTwu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Luan has a neutral characteristic that lends itself well to a diverse range of genres. The bass is detailed and fast, but it doesn&apos;t have the same rumble as other dynamic driver-based designs in this category, so if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, you&apos;ll need to tweak the EQ. There is good definition overall, but a little extension in the sub-bass region would have made the Luan that much more immersive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85" name="sivga-luan-6.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qw25pz4McLrBq6oJaS6u85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mids have a natural presentation, and vocals come through clean and clear. The dynamics are fantastic, there&apos;s good instrument separation, and the Luan shines with ensemble pieces. The treble has good extension, and there&apos;s a sense of airiness to the mix, and while there is some sibilance at times, it isn&apos;t overly harsh.</p><p>The soundstage is among the best in this class, and Sivga didn&apos;t really put a foot wrong in this regard. The Luan does a great job with detail rendition, and while I would have liked a slightly elevated bass, that&apos;s the only quibble I have with the headphones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7" name="sivga-luan-11.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8tvG9TtW3pDkrmiFAXSzA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, Sivga did a magnificent job with the Luan. The headphones have a sublime design, and the generous use of wood and steel allows them to stand out from other products in this category. There are zero issues with the build quality, and the Luan is extremely comfortable in daily use. One of the main reasons I used the 99 Classics is because of the lightweight design and fit, and while the Luan is heavier, I didn&apos;t notice the added heft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94" name="sivga-luan-2.jpg" alt="Sivga Luan review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QFtk74mgnoK8kXEfwkcC94.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound also plays a big part, and the neutral signature along with excellent dynamics makes the Luan a viable contender to the likes of the HD6XX. Ultimately, if you want open back headphones with a neutral sound and an eye-catching design, you can&apos;t go wrong with the Luan.</p>

<ul><li>Launched in 2017, the Google Play Security Program will no longer be functional after August 31.</li><li>However, researchers can still submit security reports, which will be addressed until September 30.</li><li>Google cites a "decrease in actionable vulnerabilities reported" as the reason for its discontinuation.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><em>Updated 4:00pm ET with new comments from Google.</em></p><p>After seven successful years, Google’s Play Security Reward Program is ending on August 31. The company recently let developers know about the decision via email.</p><p>The program paid developers who found and disclosed vulnerabilities in Android apps, explained Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-security-reward-program-winding-down-3472376/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The program, which was fairly unique, has "achieved its goals," a Google spokesman told Android Authority.</p><p>"We greatly appreciate the security research community that helps keep Android users safe. The Google Play Security Reward Program (GPSRP) was the first program of its type to pay a bonus reward in addition to any applicable developer vulnerability reward programs. Launched to encourage app developers to establish their own security programs, GPSRP has achieved its goal after 7 years."<br>
<br></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Google kicked off the program in 2017 to encourage developers and security researchers to find vulnerabilities in Google’s websites, apps, Chrome and Chrome OS, and Pixel devices. Researchers who spotted and reported issues were rewarded with cash from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Though it did boost Android and Google Play security, the system is no longer necessary, Google told us. "As a result of our advancements in Android security features and OS hardening, we’ve seen fewer actionable vulnerabilities reported to the GPSRP program by the research community. Due to this decrease in actionable vulnerabilities reported, we are winding down the program."</p><p>"We encourage researchers to work directly with application developers should they discover potential security vulnerabilities," he added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH" name="google-play-security-rewards-program-email.jpg" alt="GPSRP discontinue email" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TC4xkXEAerPZBoavwGKwAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman/ via Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, the program will end on August 31; however, reports submitted before that period will be triaged by September 15, and final reward decisions are expected to be made before September 30. After that, the program will be "officially discontinued," the Android security team notes in the email.</p><p>The GPSRP was an extra step to gather vulnerability data and create automated checks. These checks would be applied to all Android apps on the Play Store to check for similar vulnerabilities and make the app store safer, even though Google already has its own set of measures to keep the Play Store safe for those many apps. Either way, it is about to end—for better or worse.</p>
