<ul><li>Sonos unveiled its new AirGo Vision smart glasses at the Hong Kong Smart Glasses summit.

<hr>
<p>On Friday (June 28), Solos announced the launch of its AirGo Vision, the first-ever smart glasses integrated with ChatGPT-4o, which gives these glasses a multimodal AI touch. </p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/chatgpt-on-solos-airgo-3-smart-glasses">Solos AirGo 3</a> smart glasses received ChatGPT&apos;s capabilities to translate speech to and from your language of choice via the glasses&apos; built-in microphone and speakers.</p><p>With the new version, the glasses come with an in-built camera and LED frames, although the company states these glasses "aim to provide consumers with both choice and privacy." One unique feature introduced with this new version is allowing users to swap out frames, choosing when and how they want to use their front camera. When the user opts out of using the front camera, the glasses will continue to maintain all smart functionality aside from the camera. </p><p>These AirGo Vision smart glasses are said to provide real-time information based on what the user is looking at, be it recognizing people or objects. For instance, you can ask the glasses, "What am I looking at?" or even help the user navigate through a new city by simply asking for directions to a landmark or monument without pulling out the phone. The glasses will then respond to the prompts via the built-in speakers.</p><p>Much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">Meta&apos;s Ray Ban smart glasses</a>, these AirGo Vision glasses can also capture photos/visuals on the go.</p><p>The company states that users can even track visual progress and next steps while performing activities like cooking, home improvement, and shopping. Users can simply ask the glasses for a better price option for the commodity in question. </p><p>"Our in-house software team has built the AirGo Vision to harness the power of the best AI models available today," said Kenneth Fan, co-founder of Solos. </p>

<p>Regarding the wearable&apos;s usage and power conservation, Solos claims that these smart glasses are built to be used throughout the day and are the most power-efficient on the market.  </p><p>The company states that it wants to really hone in on the hands-fee capabilities of the AirGo Vision. The glasses are expected to have LED notifications on the frame that can be modified into sound or vibration based on the environment the user is in. </p><p>For instance, if the person wearing the glasses is in a quiet location like a library or meeting room, a discreet flash will alert the wearer without disturbing others with sound or vibration. Whereas in noisy environments, where a notification might not be heard, the LED light will visually alert users of incoming calls or important emails. This also acts as a great accessibility feature for those who have problems with hearing. </p><p>"We understand there are different ways people want or need to receive information and are committed to enhancing and customizing the AirGo experience so wearable AI is accessible to all," said Kenny Cheung, Solos GM and president. </p><p>AirGo Vision is set to go on sale "later this year." Solos will release LED-only frames in three different styles starting in July, which can be purchased on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://solosglasses.com/">Solos&apos; website</a> for $249.99.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While many iPhone users are rejoicing about the potential of the revamped Siri experience and the ability to place icons anywhere, others are more excited about RCS. Despite not being available with the first iOS 18 Developer Beta, RCS Messaging has been enabled with the second beta, released this week.</p><p>The promise of RCS is pretty simple, as it aims to provide a much smoother and feature-rich messaging experience. The easiest comparison is to think of it as using something like Telegram or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> but from the built-in Messages app. This includes things such as read receipts, typing indicators, message reactions, and high-quality media. </p><p>For years, Google has tried to get Apple on the RCS train to no avail, and it wasn&apos;t until late 2023 that Apple caved. In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">surprise announcement</a>, Apple confirmed it would be bringing RCS compatibility to the iPhone, while "also working with the GSMA to improve the RCS standard."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1290px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.79%;"><img id="ag4SP9fp6YzTbdXU7axU4A" name="enable-rcs-messaging-iphone.PNG" alt="Toggle to enable RCS Messaging in iPhone Settings app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ag4SP9fp6YzTbdXU7axU4A.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1290" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After installing the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18 Developer Beta</a>, I jumped into the Settings app to confirm that the RCS toggle was available. Not only was it available, but it was already enabled. Then, I opened the Messages app and started to send a text to my colleague, Nick Sutrich. </p><p>To my surprise, the Messages app informed me that it was sending a Text Message and that it was using RCS. A few minutes later, we found that a lot of things worked just as we&apos;d expected. Typing indicators appeared, videos sent either way were crystal clear, and Tapback reactions popped up as soon as they were made.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1290px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.56%;"><img id="VivfyPMrivoLCaZom3v2x9" name="ios-18-rcs-messaging-test-2.jpeg" alt="Initial RCS test message sent from Andrew's iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VivfyPMrivoLCaZom3v2x9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1290" height="291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also evident that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/early-look-rcs-support-apple-iphone">Apple has some work to do</a>. Nick tried reacting with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">Photomoji</a> to the video I sent. However, instead of showing up just like a Tapback reaction, it came through to my iPhone as an MMS with a message that said, "Reacted with a photomoji."</p><p>About a minute later, the conversation switched back to RCS from SMS/MMS. This is where another hiccup appears, as one would hope that the transition back and forth would be instantaneous. Although, I guess it&apos;s better than needing to go back into the Settings app and toggle RCS off and on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3315px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.76%;"><img id="cj9f6Yrm35Ft2sVNgw4Bs9" name="ios-18-dev-beta-rcs-testing.jpg" alt="RCS testing between Nick and Andrew" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cj9f6Yrm35Ft2sVNgw4Bs9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3315" height="2412" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An earlier report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/24/ios-18-rcs-iphone-beta/">9to5Mac</a> stated, "RCS support on the iPhone relies on Apple working with carrier partners to get them to update their bundles." At the time of that writing, it was reported that RCS Messaging was only available on AT&T and T-Mobile. </p><p>This no longer seems to be the case, as my personal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> is on Verizon and was used in the above screenshots. That being said, don&apos;t expect this to work across all carriers, primarily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> such as Mint Mobile or Visible, just yet. We&apos;ve also seen reports of users with older iPhone models not being able to use RCS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dnjsji/comment/la58uqy/">without a workaround</a> despite being enrolled in the iOS 18 Developer Beta. </p><p>We&apos;re still early in the development cycle for iOS 18, as the latest software isn&apos;t expected to arrive until this Fall. That gives Apple ample time to work out the kinks before the final release. But this showed us what messaging between iOS and Android should have been all along. </p>
<h2 id="it-didn-apos-t-have-to-be-this-way-2">It didn&apos;t have to be this way</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW" name="imessage-green-bubble.jpeg" alt="An iMessage chat showing blue and green bubbles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcMNVPGPdvh6VTJEcfRgGW.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve long complained about not being able to use iMessage on Android, as it&apos;s one of the primary ways I keep in touch with family. As a result, I&apos;ve turned to workarounds such as AirMessage, Bluebubbles, Sunbird, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-mini-removed-from-the-play-store">Beeper</a>. But, after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sunbird-pulls-app-from-playstore">security issues exposed Sunbird</a> and Beeper failed to win the fight against Apple, I&apos;ve all but given up on the idea.</p><p>The reality of the situation is that it should have never been this way. Apple might be one of the most valuable companies in the world, but it also holds the distinction of being among the consumer-hostile companies.</p><p>It&apos;s not like RCS is a standard spawned out of thin air, nor is it something brand new. In fact, RCS has been around since 2008 and was made available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> back in 2020. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4evyiRw853RVxpTLwWtYqL" name="beeper-app-galaxy-z-fold-5-iphone-14-pro-max-angled-close.jpg" alt="Angled close-up of Beeper app icon on Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4evyiRw853RVxpTLwWtYqL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, it wasn&apos;t until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-gives-android-imessage-app-one-more-go">Beeper debacle</a>, paired with <em>another </em>threat from the EU, that Apple decided to change its tune. What makes the entire situation maddening is that it&apos;s never needed to be this way. </p><p>After using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-rcs-chat-features-google-messages">RCS</a> to send messages back and forth to Nick for just a few minutes, I ended up incredibly irritated. The "walled garden" approach is a fantastic idea for offering an unrivaled cross-device experience. Your phone, tablet, and computer all work <em>together</em> without needing to jump through hoops. </p><p>The problem is that Apple doesn&apos;t (or didn&apos;t) want its customers to think or even consider what&apos;s on the other side of the wall. It&apos;s why we see ancient phones being used to depict various Android-related features on Apple&apos;s support pages. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QCEyddpVeGNmiKC3G4dZhg" name="facetime-links.jpg" alt="Facetime Links" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QCEyddpVeGNmiKC3G4dZhg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seriously, Apple was using a picture of a chonky, generic-looking Android phone to showcase "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-users-can-finally-get-facetime-new-invite-links">FaceTime invite links</a>" in 2021. This was a time when phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>, OnePlus 9 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> were making waves. All in an effort to let Apple customers think that the other side of its finely pruned garden was a wild jungle.</p><p>It&apos;s also why Apple kept up the charade for so long regarding RCS and iMessage. The elitism on display is essentially a Cold War-style attack on the non-Apple consumer. </p><p>Did you want to send your grandparents a video of your newborn from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>? Get ready for questions about why it looks like the video was taken on a camcorder from the 90s. Were you left out of a group chat with iPhone-wielding friends? Good luck trying to get everyone to use a different messaging platform, especially if you&apos;re the only one with an Android phone. </p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m extremely happy to see RCS finally come to the iPhone. But after actually using it, it just reaffirmed the stubbornness of a company with the resources and size of Apple. </p>

<hr>
<p>Artificial intelligence is helping Google Translate expand with 110 new languages, which is its biggest update yet.</p><p>Google announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/translate/google-translate-new-languages-2024/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that this huge expansion includes languages spoken by over 614 million people worldwide, or about 8% of the global population. The variety is amazing, from the widely spoken world languages spoken by more than 100 million people to the cherished dialects of indigenous communities.</p><p>Even languages with no current native speakers are included, showing Google&apos;s dedication to preserving endangered languages.</p><p>Adding to this impressive update, Google has focused on African languages, making up about a quarter of the new additions. Languages like Fon, Kikongo, Luo, Ga, Swati, Venda, and Wolof are now part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-ai-accessibility-improvements">Google Translate</a>, marking its most significant push into African languages so far.</p><p>Google&apos;s PaLM 2 large language model has been crucial in expanding Translate. It learns related languages, enabling the addition of Hindi-related tongues like Awadhi and Marwadi, as well as French creoles like Seychellois and Mauritian.</p><p>Meanwhile, adding widely spoken languages like Cantonese comes with its own set of challenges due to the shared written characters with Mandarin. Despite these hurdles, Google’s dedication to linguistic diversity shines through. A prime example is the inclusion of Manx, a Celtic language from the Isle of Man that nearly went extinct in 1974. Thanks to revitalization efforts, fluency has risen to thousands.</p><p>This expansion also includes Punjabi written in the Shahmukhi script, a Perso-Arabic variant used in Pakistan, where it&apos;s the most widely spoken language.</p><p>Google recognizes that translating languages isn&apos;t easy due to regional variations, dialects, and spelling differences. Some languages, like Romani, with its many dialects, don&apos;t have a single standard version, making translation tricky.</p><p>Before this expansion, Google Translate&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-adds-two-dozen-languages-used-by-over-300-million-people">biggest update was in May 2022 with the introduction of Zero-Shot Machine Translation</a>. This technology allows the model to learn new languages without needing pre-existing translated examples. This was a major advancement in machine translation, helping Google bridge language gaps even further.</p><p>This expansion is a major step toward Google&apos;s 1,000 Languages Initiative, which aims to use AI models to support the world&apos;s top 1,000 languages.</p>

<hr>
<p>After introducing the first OnePlus Pad, followed by a cheaper “Go” variant, the company is back with a Pro edition, dubbed OnePlus Pad Pro, and it has been unveiled in China.</p><p>It has been tailored as a performance-driven Android tablet with Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 underneath. While the design seems like the first OnePlus Pad, the new Pro model weighs 584 grams and measures 6.49mm in thickness.</p>
<p>It comes in two simple colorways: Khaki Green and Space Gray. The Pro variant has a bigger 12.1-inch LCD display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 3000 x 2120 resolution, a unique 7:5 aspect ratio, and 900 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Keeping the lights on the OnePlus Pad Pro is a massive 9510mAh battery capacity supporting the company’s proprietary 67W super flash charging. </p><p>The OnePlus Pad Pro includes a stylus and a Smart Touch Keyboard that offers a PC-level trackpad. On the side note, OnePlus has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opposhop.cn/cn/web/products/28809.html">also shared</a> the tablet’s AnTuTu benchmark rating with the Snapdragon chip, which hit a 2316067 score.</p>

<p>The Pad Pro’s camera specs are still unclear, but it comes with both front and rear cameras with modules similar to those seen in older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-go-launched-in-india">Pad Go</a> tablets. The other highlights of the Android tablet include support for 5G, NFC, and ColorOS for Pad running out of the box. For audio, the tablet relies on six-speaker surround sound.</p><p>The OnePlus Pad Pro is offered in multiple storage models, including 8GB+128GB, 8GB+256GB, 12GB+256GB, and 16GB+512GB, which are priced for pre-sale at CNY 2799, CNY 2999, CNY 3299, and CNY 3699, respectively. The device will be widely available starting July 3 as the official sale begins.</p><p>While the launch of the new tablet aimed at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> is currently confined to China, its global debut is expected to happen soon, presumably with the same OnePlus Pad Pro moniker.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus debuts its new Watch 2 variant in China, which brings eSIM (LTE) support to consumers, which its earlier launch lacked.</li><li>With a 1.43-inch AMOLED display, the Watch 2 variant boasts Qualcomm's Snapdragon W5 SoC, "high-precision" sensors for fitness, and map updates.</li><li>The device is available for pre-order in China at a price that roughly equates to $247.</li><li>There are rumors that OnePlus could rebrand the device to the "Watch 2R" for an overseas launch, but this has not been confirmed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus debuted a new wearable in China, dubbed the "Watch 2," and its specifications look similar to the current 2024 model.</p><p>The company announced the OnePlus Watch 2 launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/OkYyNziZV?pagetype=profilefeed">on Weibo</a> following its presentation today (June 27). From its official pre-order listing, OnePlus states the Watch 2 features a 1.43-inch AMOLED display. Powering the device is Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> SoC, which is the same as the current overseas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>.</p><p>A (machine-translated) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/OkXGDlAQb">subsequent post</a> highlights what sets this device apart: independent eSIM (LTE) support. OnePlus states that its Watch 2 will let users answer and send messages and calls without grabbing their Android phone. Moreover, the company states it has improved the watch&apos;s map navigation, creating a more intuitive and "secure" environment.</p><p>For workouts, the Watch 2 packs "high-precision" sensors on its back to assist the user in obtaining "accurate" fitness data.</p><p>The device contains a few features aimed at convenience, such as falling asleep with the watch on, which will "automatically pause music." The Watch 2 can search for your paired smartphone if you&apos;ve misplaced it, vibrate for reminders, and take photos remotely with the push of a button.</p><p>Another difference is the new Watch 2 in China offers a circular dial around its watch face instead of the full glass design from earlier this year. OnePlus also includes two raised physical buttons on the side, sliding away from the raised vertical edge.</p>

<p>Other specifications see the device offering a RAM/storage configuration of 2/32GB. Keeping the Watch 2 running is a 500mAh battery. OnePlus adds that the smartwatch supports Android (Wear OS), alongside iOS devices.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 2 is available for pre-order in China for ¥1,749, which is roughly $247. The company adds that the device will hit the shelves on July 3 on home soil.</p><p>Whether folks overseas will see this device is still unclear. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/27/oneplus-watch-2-china-updated-design-lte/">9to5Google</a> notes that there have been rumors that China&apos;s OnePlus Watch 2 could be rebranded as the "Watch 2R" overseas. The "R" moniker is typically how OnePlus rebrands its devices when making them available outside of China.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 27), Amazon announced its new partnership with Xbox as it looks to bring cloud gaming capabilities to its streaming product.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/xbox-gaming-on-amazon-fire-tv">press release</a>, Amazon stated that Xbox players could enjoy the Game Pass Ultimate library on their TV in July with a "compatible" Fire TV Stick. Users must download the Xbox app through the Amazon app store to get started, alongside their Microsoft account credentials.</p><p>If users are already an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, the entire library will be accessible. If not, Amazon will prompt them to sign up to begin enjoying its cloud gaming privileges.</p><p>The company states that its cloud gaming capabilities through the Fire TV Stick enable gamers to enjoy graphic-intensive titles like Senua&apos;s Saga: Hellblade II, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76.</p><p>Amazon adds that a "solid internet connection" is required to maximize its full gaming possibilities.</p><p>Additionally, games can be played with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gaming-controllers-amazon-fire-tv">Bluetooth-capable controller</a>. The post states such devices include the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, and PlayStation&apos;s DualSense and DualShock 4 controllers.</p>

<p>Samsung is prepping for its foldables launch, which is now only a couple of weeks away, and we are finally moving away from renderings to official image leaks. Thanks to one such leak, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 can now be spotted in their official cases.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MoisesElPro2/status/1806035151459368961">Arsène Lupin on X</a> managed to grab the images of the upcoming Galaxy foldables devices in their official cases, which are generally sold alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> after their release after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">July 10 launch</a>.

<p>The cases match the device’s color options; for instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes in gray, silver, and navy blue colorways, and the protective cases complement the handset. Some of the cases also include support for the S-Pen. On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 seems to be coming in sea green and accompanied by the same colored key holder case alongside other gray and navy blue colorways.</p><p>The rest of the devices resemble the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Z Flip 5</a> models. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes again with the same folder-icon-shaped cover screen with dual primary cameras placed right next to it. Interestingly, the rings surrounding the camera lenses also match the device’s color accent, giving a comprehensive look.</p>

<p>The device is said to carry a new design this year, including sharp edges instead of rounded corners, as seen in the previous iteration. The exact design change can also be spotted in the aforementioned images. The cover screen is also expected to be wider than the predecessor; however, that isn&apos;t rightly visible in the cases’ images.</p><p>While we await the launch alongside the case renders, alleged official images of the other product portfolio, such as the Galaxy Watch 7, the new Watch 7 Ultra, and the new Galaxy Buds 3, have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">popped up on the internet</a>.</p>

<ul><li>A Xiaomi representative confirmed that the company would only use AMOLED panels on flagship Redmi phones in the future.</li><li>The decision was made despite the same executive being sensitive to display flicker, something AMOLED suffers from.</li><li>Fewer companies are using LCDs despite growing concerns over negative health effects caused by display flickering.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Proponents of LCD panels have lost yet another battle today as Redmi confirms that flagship phones will only feature AMOLED panels going forward. This includes the Redmi Note and Redmi K series, but the most isn&apos;t all that surprising considering these phones haven&apos;t used LCD panels for several years.</p><p>What is surprising is how the news was delivered. Redmi Marketing Manager Ethan Zhang Yu posted the news on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5049138127308491">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xiaomitime.com/redmi-announces-it-will-no-longer-use-lcd-screens-5180/">XiaomiTime</a>), expressing his condolences to all the LCD fans who have been asking to make another flagship with an LCD panel for years. In the message (translated below by Microsoft Copilot), Zhang notes that he is a flicker-sensitive user and can understand these requests very well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.37%;"><img id="b5RFGCmEBoX7HmLc3k5suR" name="weibo-screenshot-redmi-ethan-zhang-yu-lcd.png" alt="A screenshot of a post from Xiaomi's Ethan Zhang Yu announcing the company would no longer use LCD panels in flagship phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5RFGCmEBoX7HmLc3k5suR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="778" height="353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, while Zhang empathizes with other flicker-sensitive users, he admits that LCD is no longer seen as a flagship phone-worthy technology. Ironically, this means that Zhang cannot use the phones Xiaomi produces under its Redmi brand.</p><p>Additionally, Zhang briefly discusses how picking a display panel for a smartphone isn&apos;t as simple as "swapping it out" for a different one and that display panels are a deep part of a phone&apos;s engineering.</p>
<p>LCD fans, or even folks that need an LCD due to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, shouldn&apos;t hope for a special version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">the latest Redmi Note</a>, according to Zhang. While OLED technology delivers better black levels, deeper contrast ratios, and significantly better-viewing angles, the display tech is prone to long-term burn-in and flickers in a way LCD technology does not. It also means that users are looking directly at LED diodes, providing a harsher form of light than LCD&apos;s traditionally diffused back or side lighting.</p><p>This begs the question: what are flicker-sensitive users supposed to do if companies no longer offer smartphones they can physically use? Flicker sensitivity is a disability like any other and one that has become increasingly difficult to deal with as more LEDs make their way into the world.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="He3dCDqACwDxikH7EWPPNF" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-moto-razr-plus-cover-screen-apps.jpg" alt="Comparing apps on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5's cover screen with the Motorola Razr Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/He3dCDqACwDxikH7EWPPNF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While LED technology like OLED, AMOLED, LCD, and even the lights in your home don&apos;t <em>need</em> to strobe on and off, the fact of the matter is that many manufacturers have turned to what&apos;s known as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to manage LED brightness levels.</p><p>In a nutshell, many OLED panels and some LED lights rapidly turn on and off hundreds or thousands of times per second. While human eyeballs cannot "see" this rapid flickering, human brains perceive the flickering as a source of light depending on how long the LED is kept on during this flickering cycle.</p><p>As with anything else brain-related, everyone is different, and some people experience severe pain when looking at these lights. Unfortunately, I&apos;m one of those people.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Most people — tech journalists included — have never heard of PWM and have no idea that OLED panels flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I spoke with Bill Maffucci, vice president at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kopin-corporation/">Kopin Corporation</a>, about the differences between LCD and OLED display technology. More specifically, I wanted to know why OLED displays always flicker a bit, even when they don&apos;t use pulse width modulation to control brightness. His answer was quite illuminating.</p><p>“With an LCD panel, the backlight is energized during the entire frame, and you, therefore, would not experience a change in brightness during the frame.  With an OLED, the individual pixels emit light when first energized by the video signal and then decay over time until energized in the next frame.  The strong dip that occurs at the end of the frame appears to be the equivalent of a CRT “vertical retrace” period when the raster resets to the top of the display.”</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Part of the problem is that AMOLED and OLED technology has been pushed as a superior tech without properly explaining the potential negative health effects associated with it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In other words, OLED displays need a constant "fresh injection" of voltage to achieve a uniform level of brightness, while LCDs are better at delivering a consistent level of brightness.</p><p>Some companies have worked to fix this problem by increasing the pulse rate to thousands of hertz, thereby reducing the number of people negatively affected. It&apos;s not a fix-all for everyone, but it does help significantly compared to the 240hz or 480hz used on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Only a few companies, like TCL, still offer LCD panels on their flagship devices, often angling them as more vision-friendly. For example, the TCL Tab 10 NXTPAPER tablet pictured below uses a "paper-like" matte finish to help diffuse light from the panel in a way that looks more natural to human eyes.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that AMOLED and OLED technology has been pushed as a superior tech without properly explaining the potential negative health effects associated with it. Most people — tech journalists included — have never heard of PWM and have no idea that OLED panels flicker.</p><p>I found out this truth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">about a year ago</a> as my headaches and symptoms of nausea increased with newer smartphones. Thankfully, since then, the smartphone and display industries have started shifting to friendlier methods of dimming. The list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">best phones for PWM sensitive people</a> is now far more respectable than even just a year ago because of heightened awareness, but progress still needs to be made.</p><p>Companies like Google, Samsung, and Apple are the worst offenders of using harsh display tech among smartphone manufacturers and continue to use low PWM rates that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ssl-miller-etal-2023-LRT-pae-se%20visibility-tlm%20parameters.pdf">do not abide by research</a> showing how harmful they can be to humans.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Companies like Motorola, Honor, OnePlus, and plenty of others have added flicker-reduction options to OLED phones and it's just the responsible thing to do.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If companies continue to switch to OLED en masse, at least one of three things needs to happen. First, it&apos;s imperative that companies like Samsung, Google, and Apple adopt flicker-reduction options for flicker-sensitive users. Even laptops <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LROGwzyJYZQ">like the Galaxybook 4 Edge</a> have horrendously low PWM rates and feature other harsh flickering effects like temporal dithering.</p><p>If there&apos;s no way to turn this stuff off, these companies are quite literally telling people that they don&apos;t want their business. It&apos;s rotten. Companies like Motorola, Honor, OnePlus, and plenty of others have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">added flicker-reduction options</a> to OLED phones and it&apos;s just the responsible thing to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="E4RUvQBreVopxndys8LfTE" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-pwm-display-settings-01.jpg" alt="Taking a look at the PWM rate of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4RUvQBreVopxndys8LfTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other two action items are far less likely and almost certainly not going to happen. One, companies could offer to support LCD panel phones for longer, enabling flicker-sensitive users to use modern devices still until a better solution comes along. Heck, offer a subscription model so that users who need it can offer monetary compensation so companies can have developers support devices long term.</p><p>Lastly—and I know this one isn&apos;t going to happen—start informing people of the potential negative side effects of using OLED technology over other types of display technology.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to accept OLED as the "clearly superior" technology when burn-in is still a substantial problem — look at my 2017 LG OLED TV to see this in action — and the potential to cause headaches, nausea, and other related issues is entirely possible. Every type of technology has trade-offs, and it&apos;s important to be informed about them. It&apos;s a shame that companies like Samsung Display don&apos;t seem concerned with offering up the truth.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger are experiencing a partial outage impacting  most of its users.</li><li>Sending and receiving Multimedia messages including photos, videos and voice notes seem to be at the center of this outage.</li><li>Whatsapp said in a tweet that it is working on fixing the issue and some users have already started to see services return to normal on their device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today, users across two Meta platforms reported disruptions in sending or receiving Multimedia messages and voice notes on WhatsApp and Messenger. </p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/27/whatsapp-messenger-picture-media-upload-outage/">9to5Google</a>, the outage began around 12 p.m. ET on Monday (June 27). It affected both services and seemed to have peaked for 82% of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/whatsapp/">Whatsapp users</a> and 79% of users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.ca/status/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a> at approximately 1 p.m. ET. </p><p>Several users have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/WhatsApp/status/1806367401899892948">taken to X to express</a> frustration about the ongoing outage.   </p><p>However, it is important to note that regular text messages were not impacted by the outage. For those experiencing it, pictures, videos, and voice messages fail to upload onto the platform or are stuck endlessly loading. </p><p>Android Central&apos;s staff tried using WhatsApp to send an image, but it took a couple of minutes to go through rather than instantly being delivered to the user. Meanwhile, WhatsApp also took X to state that it was aware of the ongoing issue and was working on resolving it. </p><p>Some users are already seeing services return to normal, and the situation is expected to improve in the next couple of hours.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another batch of leaked imagery seems to have spilled four of Samsung&apos;s upcoming products and their notable differences.</p><p>The images posted on X by known tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1806344206186672512">Evan Blass</a> showcase the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Buds 3 series. Leading off the leak is likely the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra with a rugged orange band and an up-close shot of its face. The rendering follows a trend we&apos;ve heard continuously that Samsung is opting for a squarish body with a circular watch face atop it.</p><p>In this orange hue, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra features orange accents around its dial and in the center of one of its two (pushable) physical buttons. The render highlights that third physical interactable, which appears to rotate. All in all, Samsung&apos;s new Watch design shifts it closer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple&apos;s behavior</a>.</p><p>The leak includes a look at the base Galaxy Watch 7 with a design that looks similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6</a>. The image shows off the device sporting a rugged band of its own in a forest green color.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the new buds leak seems to be from the base and Pro models. If our speculation is correct, the base Buds 3 notably lacks the silicone tip to help sit comfortably inside an ear. Instead, users may have to settle with Samsung&apos;s new stem stabilizer to help keep the vanilla Buds from falling out.</p><p>The assumed Buds 3 Pro features a silicone tip for in-ear use and sports a silver (or gray) colorway. The leaked rendering shows the device inside a new case design with blue and orange lights, likely indicators of each bud&apos;s recharge progress.</p><p>Leaked renders of the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra over the past few months have sung the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">same design-change tune</a>. It&apos;s beginning to seem likely that this is the design Samsung intends to debut next month. Previous leaks suggest the device will contain a 1.5-inch display diameter, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, but with slightly bigger dimensions at 47 x 47.14 x 16.4mm.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">a pixelated look</a> at some assumed Samsung promotional material spoiled the design of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. That rendering showed what we&apos;ve continued to see, a gray-colored set of buds with a stem like Apple&apos;s AirPods. However, the alleged look at the base model is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">sharp departure from old</a> as consumers may experience a new design with no ear tips.</p><p>Regardless, Samsung announced that its Unpacked event will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, at 9 am EDT. Interested parties can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">reserve any of its new Galaxy products</a> and receive $50 of in-store credit.</p>
