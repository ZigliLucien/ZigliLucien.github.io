<p>If you were already considering an <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> this back-to-school season, getting $350 in store credit from Best Buy might be worth your while. If you're looking to get rid of an old device, you'll also be eligible to receive some nice trade-in credit from the retailer.</p>
<p>This phone boasts a lot of design improvements over the Pixel Fold, and while there are now several options available in the foldable phone market, this one's not a bad pick for fans of the Pixel ecosystem. The whole <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> includes the same speedy Tensor G4 SoC processor, along with Google's line of Gemini AI features.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-5g-256gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587911.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1964ea1-6509-4aa8-ae3e-b0a0ddccac71" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,799 with a free $350 gift card at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$1,799 with a free $350 gift card at Best Buy">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>you want to buy a new phone outright, and you don&apos;t mind spending a good amount of money; you&apos;re looking for a premium foldable phone that offers a large set of screens; you want a versatile phone with easy multitasking options.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to spend this much money on a new phone; you&apos;d prefer to go for something more affordable and might consider other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">Pixel 9 deals</a>.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is no joke when it comes to price, especially considering that you can save over $700 going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> or the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Still, if your heart&apos;s set on a foldable phone that dwells in the Pixel-sphere, and you&apos;ve got the money to spend, the latest foldable effort from Google will give you what you pay for.</p><p>This phone includes a ton of useful and fun Gemini AI features, design improvements from the last-generation Pixel Fold, and a few slight upgrades for the camera suite. The base model comes with 256GB of RAM or you can upgrade to 512GB for an extra $120.</p><p>Sure, the outright price on this phone is pretty daunting, and a $350 gift card can only go so far (although it could easily get you a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases</a>). However, there are other options to save more, such as trading in a current device or financing through your retailer. In any case, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold seems worth the attention of foldable phone lovers, even at the premium price point. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Back when the POCO F6 and F6 Pro launched, I focused my attention on the regular model. POCO decided to limit the F6 Pro to just a few global markets, and the device didn&apos;t make its way to India and most Southeast Asian regions. Instead, POCO offered the F6 as the default option in these countries.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6 review</a>, I called it one of the best value-focused phones of the year, and that&apos;s down to how affordable it is in India, where it retails for just ₹27,999 ($336). That said, POCO doesn&apos;t quite offer the same value in other regions; the F6 is available for £359 ($457) in the U.K., and that isn&apos;t nearly as enticing.</p><p>Thankfully, there&apos;s a better option available: the F6 Pro. The phone is now down to £449 ($572), and that makes it worthy of consideration if you&apos;re interested in a new mid-ranger. I didn&apos;t use the F6 Pro when it came out, but I switched to it after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-sunset-dune-hands-on">OnePlus 12R Sunset Dune edition</a>; it didn&apos;t take long to realize that POCO is onto something special with its 2024 flagship.</p><p>The F6 Pro has a much better design than the standard model, and the white color variant in particular looks striking. I don&apos;t usually prefer phones with flat sides, but POCO added beveled edges, and that makes a big difference in daily use. The glass window around the rear camera housing has been a mainstay on POCO phones going back four years now, and it ends up looking elegant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K" name="poco-f6-pro-12.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro home page against white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ddDr5r9ex4XT8zjddqd49K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t shortchange users with material choices either; the F6 Pro uses an aluminum frame that&apos;s sandwiched between panes of glass, and it looks just as premium as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> — if anything, I like POCO&apos;s design more. The only drawback in this area is that the phone has IP54 ingress protection, and that isn&apos;t adequate; even the regular F6 gets an IP64 rating, so I&apos;m not really sure what POCO was thinking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM" name="poco-f6-pro-10.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro bezels highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNMfigPxwZHmyh5zXv9GwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that and an in-screen module that sits a little too low on the screen, there&apos;s nothing to complain about the design; the F6 Pro has ideal weight distribution, and the textured pattern underneath the glass looks fantastic. There&apos;s a lot to like about the panel too; POCO went with a 120Hz AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution, and it is easily the best screen of any of its devices to date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM" name="poco-f6-pro-9.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro selfie lens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSJrHWKsNu8k8iC6eTfNZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel doesn&apos;t get quite as bright as other mid-rangers I used this year — the 12R is noticeably brighter outdoors — but it is still a strong showing. On that note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> is absolutely the right call; Qualcomm&apos;s 2024 chipset still has a lot to offer, and it is just as fast in daily use.</p>

<p>Considering that the 12R is also powered by the same silicon, the F6 Pro is on an equal footing. I didn&apos;t see any issues in the week I used the phone as my daily driver, and it handles demanding games with ease; the only tangible gain you&apos;ll see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-vs-8-gen-2-vs-a17-pro-benchmarks">8 Gen 3</a> is better battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL" name="poco-f6-pro-3.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro camera module with all sensors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGFpkfkpfhHdZkgn8bJmEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s a similar story with the cameras; the F6 Pro manages to take better shots than the F6 in just about every situation, and it holds up incredibly well in low-light scenarios. The 12R has a slender edge in this area, but on the whole, the F6 Pro isn&apos;t far behind.</p><p>That said, the biggest issue with the cameras is that the auxiliary 8MP wide-angle lens isn&apos;t anywhere as good as the main camera, and I still don&apos;t understand why POCO can&apos;t deliver two usable sensors at the back. This is true of the 12R as well, and only Google manages to deliver a mid-ranger with a wide-angle camera that&apos;s actually decent.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gFkyPB2jgiKuHqxRkhNaPN" name="poco-f6-pro-11.jpg" alt="POCO F6 Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gFkyPB2jgiKuHqxRkhNaPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t change any software features from the standard F6, and while I still believe that the software is in need of a visual overhaul, it is much better optimized this year. The interface is fluid, there&apos;s a good amount of customizability, and it doesn&apos;t have any annoying bugs. There&apos;s still a lot of bloatware out of the box, and POCO isn&apos;t good at delivering updates on time — these are things it needs to actively change.</p><p>Overall, the F6 Pro is one of the best phones currently available in the mid-range segment. POCO&apos;s decision to not launch the device in most global markets is puzzling; it is the ideal alternative to the OnePlus 12R and Galaxy A55, and with the manufacturer setting lofty goals this year, wider availability of the F6 Pro would have highlighted the brand&apos;s ambition in this segment.</p>

<p>Late Tuesday, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-att-wireless">AT&T</a> customers faced a service disruption while trying to connect, which also affected 911 services in several cities.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has big design improvements for durability and repairability, such as the new dual-entry design lets you replace the screen or battery more easily.</li><li>The phone is also tougher now, spreading impact better to protect the screen and back panel.</li><li>A nice touch is the USB-C port on a separate daughterboard, making it simpler to replace.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent teardown of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> by iFixit shows Google’s major upgrades in durability and repairability, showcasing a big leap in its smartphone design, though there are still a few areas that could use some fine-tuning.</p><p>One notable improvement is the dual-entry design, which lets you remove either the display for screen fixes or just the rear panel for battery replacements (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/27/pixel-9-pro-teardown/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This design also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-durability-test-results">makes the phone tougher</a>, so it handles drops and bumps better by spreading out the impact away from the screen and back panel.</p><p>Even though it’s easy to start taking apart the Pixel 9 Pro XL from the front or rear, the display can get damaged during removal, with some delamination happening. The iFixit team had a tough time getting it off without hurting it. And while the top glass panel is a bit delicate, it’s not too hard to remove.</p><p>There are just a few stickers hiding some screws, but other than that, getting to the battery is pretty straightforward.</p><p>On the other hand, removing the battery from the Pixel 9 Pro XL turned out to be a real struggle. The iFixit team couldn’t get the battery pull tab to work, so they had to forcefully pry it out. It’s a tricky situation also seen with the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>On a brighter side, Google has moved the USB-C port to a separate daughterboard, making it easier to replace. This design change allows for smooth removal and replacement of the port, which is great considering how prone USB-C ports are to damage.</p><p>To sum it up, the Pixel 9 Pro XL brings some impressive design upgrades for better repairability and durability. However, there are a few hiccups, like the fragile display and tricky battery pull tab, where Google could have done better.</p>

I&apos;m not going to wade into anything about political hit jobs or free speech, but I do have to mention one thing—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-encryption">encryption</a> argument isn&apos;t really valid because Telegram isn&apos;t always encrypted.</p>
<p>People didn&apos;t realize that every Telegram group message is sent in plain text through a Telegram server and much of it is saved. The French government will have plenty of evidence sitting there for them to look at. </p><p>The only way to use encryption with Telegram is to have a one-on-one messaging session with someone and enable the "Secret Chat" setting. If you don&apos;t do that, it&apos;s not encrypted.</p>
<p>It&apos;s good that people are realizing that their group chats are wide open. It also brings up a couple of other things to consider: do you really care about encrypted messaging, and if you do, which apps are better at it than Telegram?</p><p>The first question is something only you can answer, but I can give you <em>my</em> answer: yes, I care. I&apos;m not worried if someone knows I texted my wife to remind her to bring home a bottle of orange juice when she&apos;s out at the store or that anyone sees me send my grandkids a goofy picture of Snoopy on a jet ski. I just don&apos;t want them to be able to know it unless I tell them.</p>

<p>You&apos;re probably the same, and most of what you send over a messaging app is nothing you care about. But not always. There are plenty of things we do not want to share with the world, and you know which of those things apply to you. A way to protect your privacy is to only use a messaging app that is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the intended recipient is able to decode and read it.</p>
<p>What&apos;s easier to talk about is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/telegram-vs-signal-vs-whatsapp">what apps are encrypted</a>. We&apos;ll start with the big ones — SMS and iMessage. SMS (texting) is never encrypted. Ever. Apple&apos;s iMessage is only encrypted if everyone in the message group is using a supported Apple device. This may change with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-why-imessage-rcs-support-important">iMessage update that supports RCS</a>, depending on how Apple uses the RCS profile (RCS is only encrypted thanks to Google, and both companies need to cooperate). We&apos;ll know soon enough. </p><p>That leaves two really good messaging apps that, thankfully, are encrypted no matter which brand of phone you&apos;re using or how many people are in a group: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://signal.org/blog/private-groups/">Signal</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543">WhatsApp</a>. Both apps support end-to-end encryption for one-to-one chats and group messaging by default and work on every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">modern smartphone</a>. You will need to install the app, of course, but there is nothing else for you to do.</p>
<p>While there may be other apps that use encryption properly, I can say I&apos;m sure about these two.</p>

<p>There are also two apps to mention: Facebook Messenger and Google Messages. Both might be encrypted, but they might not.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10252671?hl=en#:~:text=Your%20conversations%20are%20encrypted%20end,your%20individual%20and%20group%20conversations.">Google Messages</a> is like Apple&apos;s iMessage: if all parties in the chat are using Google&apos;s encrypted RCS, then it works. If not, it defaults to a regular MMS group and is not encrypted.</p><p>Facebook Messenger is a little weird. Chats are encrypted as long as everyone is using Meta&apos;s app or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605">computer with the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser</a>. If someone is using Safari or Opera, for example, encryption is broken.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to remember that social media DMs on services like X or Instagram are not encrypted.</p>
<p>This may or may not be important to you and only you can decide. But at least you know a little about what is and isn&apos;t encrypted just in case.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Chat just got a powerful IFTTT and UKG Flow integration, letting you set up almost all kinds of automations whether you&apos;re on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> or using a personal account.</p><p>With IFTTT, users can now link up Google Chat with over 1,000 popular apps, while UKG Flow brings UKG Pro WFM features straight into Chat for easy employee access, as detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/automate-your-workflows-on-google-chat-with-IFTTT-and-UKG-flow.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>IFTTT, which stands for "If This, Then That," is a platform that lets you create custom automations that kick in when certain things happen.</p><p>In Google Chat, IFTTT&apos;s main function is to help users create custom workflows and automate routine tasks seamlessly. With access to over 1,000 apps, it makes Chat way more efficient and personalized, according to Google.</p><p>For instance, you can set up automatic welcome messages for new space members, trigger alerts when files get added to cloud storage like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>, Dropbox, or Box, and keep track of social media mentions by having tags from Discord, X, and Facebook instantly posted in a space.</p><p>For organizations, this means things run smoother and productivity gets a boost. Automating everyday tasks, like welcome messages, becomes a breeze.</p><p>To dive into IFTTT, just visit its Google Chat integration page and sign in with your Google account. It’s up for grabs now for Google Workspace users, Workspace Individual Subscribers, and anyone with a personal Google account.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO shows off a new tri-folding phone concept that measures 11mm when folded.</li><li>The phone has a 6.48-inch display when folded and opens up to a 10-inch 3K OLED panel and can by arranged in a number of ways.</li><li>TECNO is also preparing to launch two new foldable phones soon, the Phantom V Fold 2 and V Flip 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO is no stranger to interesting concept devices, several of which it showed off earlier this year at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/coolest-things-mwc-2024">MWC 2024</a>. Now, after showing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-is-the-latest-brand-to-unfurl-a-rollable-phone-concept">Phantom Ultimate</a> rollable phone concept, the company is switching things up with the Phantom Ultimate 2, a new tri-fold phone with an impressive and versatile design.</p><p>While we&apos;ve seen tri-fold concepts before, TECNO has implemented some rather impressive engineering to design one that measures just 11mm thick when folded. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is 12.1mm when its two halves are folded. The thickest part is the section that houses the triple camera system, which also holds the charging port and what looks like a speaker opening.</p><p>To achieve such thinness, TECNO is using a new hinge design that is capable of achieving a thickness of less than 9mm on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. The company also utilizes "the smartphone industry’s thinnest battery cover," measuring just 0.25mm and made of "super-compressed Titan Advanced Fiber material."</p>

<p>When closed, the primary display measures 6.48 inches. The phone then opens to feature a slim frame and a 10-inch 3K OLED panel with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Unfolded, the TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2 looks a lot like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> but with significantly smaller bezels. However, instead of just being able to fold it completely open, TECNO has implemented various folding angles to bring more versatility to the device.</p><p>In one example, the Ultimate 2 is shown standing up with 1/3 of the phone folded flat on a table and the user typing on it like a regular laptop keyboard. It&apos;s a form aimed at productivity and sort of reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-gen-9-review" target="_blank">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a> with a keyboard at the bottom. Another shows the bottom section folded back in a form that&apos;s seemingly meant for viewing media. A third form shows the phone folded in a tent-like mode, which TECNO says is ideal for scenarios like live dual-screen translation, a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-october-2023">we see more foldable phones take advantage of</a>.</p><p>TECNO has also optimized the software to take advantage of the form factor, meaning wallpapers will adjust according to how you fold or unfold the phone, and users can take advantage of multi-panel multitasking.</p>

<p>To support all these various folding scenarios, TECNO says both hinges have been tested to support up to 300,000 folds and are enhanced with 2100MPa strength.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a concept device, so TECNO has not revealed any additional specs in its press release, such as chipset, battery capacity, camera resolutions, and more. It&apos;s also unclear if and when TECNO plans to actually launch the product or one like it. Clearly, something like this wouldn&apos;t be cheap to produce, and TECNO prides itself on developing impressive devices at more affordable prices.</p><p>Speaking of, the company is also gearing up to launch its foldable devices, the Phantom V Fold 2 and Phantom V Flip 2. TECNO did not specify a launch date but says they are "scheduled for release soon." If they&apos;re anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">previous models</a>, we expect to see great designs and prices that will undercut much of the competition, especially Samsung.</p>

<ul><li>Google and the state of California announced last week that 1.5 million state residents can now add their mobile driver's license to the Google Wallet.</li><li>The company previously said that it was working on bringing more states onboard its digital ID program. </li><li>Google Wallet has been upgraded in a few key ways this year; it can now create a digital pass out of basically anything, from tickets to store loyalty and insurance cards.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google spent much of this year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">talking up its digital ID program</a>, describing plans to add more states and make the entire experience more ubiquitous. Well, it added a pretty big state last week: California, which is home to nearly 40 million people. Google and the state of California jointly announced a pilot program that would initially allow 1.5 million people to add their mobile ID to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet#section-google-wallet-summarized">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Part of the reason it&apos;s so difficult to grow Android or iOS mobile ID adoption is that many U.S. states are trying to create their own offerings from scratch rather than work with Apple or Google. Recently, New York launched its Mobile ID (MiD New York) program independently, requiring a standalone app. In fact, California had its own app — the California DMV Wallet app — before opening up the Google Wallet pilot program. The California DMV Wallet app will still be used as another option. </p><p>"It&apos;s never been easier to keep a digital driver&apos;s license and identification card in California," said Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/08/23/californians-can-now-add-their-mobile-drivers-license-to-google-wallet/" target="_blank">statement</a>. "The state continues to work to offer convenience for those opting into the mobile driver’s license program, now with the option of using Google Wallet."</p><p>To be clear, mobile IDs still have a long way to go before they are truly useful. Even now, Californians who store their driver&apos;s license in the Google Wallet are required by law to keep their physical card with them. The mobile version of their ID will only come in handy when passing through TSA checkpoints at select airports and at some restaurants. </p><p>However, adding California is still big for Google Wallet, and it&apos;ll become even more important if the pilot program is opened to more state residents. For starters, Google now supports the same number of state IDs as Apple. Google Wallet has Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland, while Apple Wallet has Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, and Ohio. Getting a state the size of California and securing a state that already has its own mobile wallet app are both huge victories for Google. </p><p>While Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-apple-wallet-are-coming-soon-to-california/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be participating in a similar pilot program with California, the mobile IDs launched in Google Wallet first, and the timetable for Apple Wallet support is unclear.</p><p>Previously, a key drawback to using Google Wallet over Apple Wallet was that fewer IDs, cards, passes, and tickets supported it. Additionally, there weren&apos;t as many places that accepted Google Pay. While I still have some reliability and user-experience concerns about Google Wallet, many of these supposed "cons" to using Google Wallet are simply outdated. Google has come a long way just this year alone, and the addition of mobile California IDs — as big as it is — isn&apos;t even the best thing to come to Google Wallet of late. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="iSNZtYCjj8zGf6UCJZgbrC" name="Google-Wallet-Add-Card-to-Wallet.jpeg" alt="Menu to add a payment card, transit pass, loyalty card, or gift card to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSNZtYCjj8zGf6UCJZgbrC.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recently, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-everything-else-spotted">added a feature</a> to the Wallet app that lets you create a pass from basically <em>anything</em>. You can scan a card in your real wallet — think an insurance card or a store loyalty card — and Google will use its text recognition and AI smarts to turn it into a Google Wallet pass. If the whole thing works as expected, the pass will be created and organized without any manual user action. If there are passes that need to be kept secure, Google Wallet can automatically create a Private Pass for those cards.</p><p>This feature alone makes the Google Wallet more versatile than the Apple Wallet. I&apos;ve been a frequent user of both digital wallet apps for years, and I loved how almost all passes that supported mobile versions worked with Apple Wallet. Some supported Apple Wallet <em>and</em> Google Wallet, but few supported Google Wallet <em>exclusively</em>.  </p><p>Now, with this feature, you don&apos;t even need a card, ticket, or pass to support a digital variant for it to work with Google Wallet. Anything you can find in your wallet should work in a digital form, and this is incredibly convenient and useful. Throw in the fact that Google Wallet has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">added support for hundreds of banks in 2024</a>, and it&apos;s clear progress is being made. Though I&apos;m still skeptical of the utility of mobile IDs, California is a big get for Google Wallet. </p><p>Looking at these improvements holistically, Google Wallet is now ready to give Apple Wallet a challenge. I doubt that many people are switching between iOS and Android based on wallet apps, but that doesn&apos;t really matter. iOS clearly had a check in the win column for many years thanks to the Apple Wallet, but that isn&apos;t as clear anymore. If Google builds on 2024&apos;s momentum, Google Wallet should be a force moving forward. </p>

<ul><li>Another set of OnePlus 13 rumors double down on the potential for a 6,000mAh battery to challenge the 12 model's battery life.</li><li>However, the device may feature 50W wireless charging, which goes against what was previously rumored this year.</li><li>Aside from the suspected LYT-808 primary sensor, speculation states the OnePlus 13 will launch late in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As consumers eagerly await the next OnePlus phone, a new rumor claims it will boast quite a battery upgrade.</p><p>The latest rumors arise from known Chinese Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station (DCS), which states the OnePlus 13 will have a 6,000mAh battery (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/27/oneplus-13-main-camera-battery-size-wired-wireless-charging-details-leaked/">Gizmochina</a>). The leak adds that the device could sport 100W wired fast charging <em>and </em>50W wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>DCS claims that the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear primary camera could be more of the same. Their post states that the company may implement the Lytia LYT-808 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture. While this seems disappointing, it&apos;s not all bad, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 12</a> features the same 1/1.4-inch sensor at 50MP and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-vs-oneplus-12-camera-review">takes rather impressive photos</a>.</p><p>That said, Digital Chat Station&apos;s rumor seemingly goes against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-charging-display-upgrade-leak">what we heard in June</a>. It was previously rumored that the OnePlus 13 would miss out on a key charging feature that its predecessor offers: wireless charging. OnePlus has gone back and forth on this as the 11 series didn&apos;t offer wireless charging while the succeeding 12 did.</p><p>What has remained consistent is the apparent upgrade from a 5,400mAh battery to 6,000mAh. The OnePlus 12 could last for up to two days (without heavy use), but it seems the 13 model could challenge that. Moreover, speculation behind OnePlus&apos; continued use of 100W wired charging hones in on what it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-charging-survey">wanted to capitalize</a> for consumers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-triple-camera-array-sensor-upgrade-leak">Rumors continue</a>, claiming that OnePlus will still feature a triple camera array; however, its ultrawide and periscope lenses might receive a buff. It was purported that both sensors might fall into Sony and its IMX882 for 50MP camera strength.</p><p>Other speculation states the OnePlus 13 may feature a 6.8-inch 2K 8T LTPO "customized" display. It might not be completely flat as older leaks suggest OnePlus could layer some "micro-curved" glass on top.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is rumored to launch late in 2024.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/labor-day-phone-sales-2024-i-tracked-down-the-10-best-android-deals-on-the-web">Labor Day sales</a> are here, and Samsung has wasted no time in dropping a bounty of sweet deals on smartphones, tablets, wearables, and more. The list is pretty long, so if you don&apos;t feel like scrolling through all of the promos on display, I&apos;ve done the work of sharing five of my favorite Android offers below so you can save yourself some time (and some cash). </p><p>First and foremost, it&apos;s worth mentioning that Samsung deals are rarely simple. Usually they involve some kind of action on your part — such as a trade-in or a carrier activation — and it&apos;s unusual for an offer to appear as a straight, no-strings discount. Still, if you play your cards right, you could find yourself earning some serious savings AND an awesome Samsung device at the same time (not to mention the exclusive color options). </p><p>For example, you could get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/"><strong>up to $1,200 off</strong></a> the Galaxy Z Fold 6 when you trade in an old or broken phone today, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926ulgaxaa/"><strong>$200 off</strong></a> when you buy an unlocked Galaxy S24 Plus. Keep reading to see more of my favorite offers, and don&apos;t forget that most of these promos are set to expire in early September — so act fast. </p>
