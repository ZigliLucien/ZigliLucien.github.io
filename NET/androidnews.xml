<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 lives up to its name, thanks to the large 5,000mAh battery, fast 30W charging, and 8GB of RAM, meaning you can juggle apps all day and still have enough juice to last you til morning. And the vegan leather finish is really the cherry on top.</p></p>

<p>Motorola is the king of budget phones in North America and the company&apos;s 2024 models have upped the ante in quite a few ways. The Moto G Power 5G was a fairly impressive phone for the price in 2023, but in 2024, things have improved in ways I didn&apos;t expect.</p><p>So should you stick to last year&apos;s model, which has seen quite a steep discount, or should you spend a little extra for the Moto G Power 5G 2024 and all the upgrades that come with it? Hopefully, this comparison will help answer that question.</p>

<p>Motorola&apos;s 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-review">Moto G Power 5G</a> launched with a rather traditional design, featuring an attractive plastic build. It&apos;s not dull by any means, and the plastic feels somewhat premium, as if it&apos;s frosted glass like what you&apos;d find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24</a> series. The back is slightly curved, and the cameras are situated in a glossier housing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 2024 model is a rather large departure from Motorola&apos;s previous budget phones. Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a>, the phone has a vegan leather finish on the back rather than the traditional plastic or glass. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">harkens back to the Moto X days</a> of yore, and it&apos;s normally the kind of finish you&apos;d find on a higher-end phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a>, so it&apos;s nice to see it trickle down to the cheaper models. It has a nice feel and is a bit warmer to the touch than the 2023 model. The back is also completely flat, and the frame is also flatter, allowing the phone to stand up on its own.</p>

<p>On the front, the phones aren&apos;t too different. The display on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> is a bit larger at 6.7 inches, but otherwise, the specs are nearly identical. Both displays feature a FHD+ resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate. The bezels are also fairly large on the phones, particularly at the bottom.</p><p>While we don&apos;t have figures on display brightness, you shouldn&apos;t have trouble viewing them indoors. However, the displays aren&apos;t the brightest, and you may have some trouble viewing them outdoors. The color science of both displays is slightly different, as the 2023 model shows brighter highlights, while the 2024 model has a bit more contrast.</p><p>One thing Motorola excels at is ensuring its displays are ideal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users, and these phones are no different, meaning you shouldn&apos;t have any problems when viewing content.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4130px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bXFxLsWLMsyw4ek4wSrTDF" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-G-Power-5G-2023-4.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 and 2023 side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bXFxLsWLMsyw4ek4wSrTDF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4130" height="2323" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to internal specs, the two phones are very similar but also very different. While the Moto G Power 5G 2024 comes with plenty of upgraded and even new specs, both have similar performance. The newer phone sports the MediaTek Dimensity 7020, which is basically just a rebranded version of the Dimensity 930 that powers the 2023 model. The biggest difference here, however, is the memory, with the 2024 model featuring 8GB of RAM. That&apos;s the same as you&apos;d find on some flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> and does great for app management.</p><p>Both phones perform well with most tasks, whether it&apos;s scrolling through social media, taking photos, consuming media, or juggling multiple apps. However, neither of these phones does particularly well when it comes to gaming, and you&apos;ll be stuck with medium settings on games like Honkai: Star Rail if you wanna have a decent gaming experience.</p>

<p>Where the Moto G Power 5G 2023 beats the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is storage capacity, with the phone sporting double the amount at 256GB. Battery capacity is also the same between the two phones, but the 2024 model comes out on top thanks to the faster 30W charging and the inclusion of wireless charging, a feature normally found on higher-end phones.</p><p>In addition, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 also has a feature that isn&apos;t often found on Motorola&apos;s budget phones: NFC. Unlike the 2023 mode, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 lets you make contactless payments and such with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>. That alone is a huge upgrade over its predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="moto-g-power-5g-2024-vs-power-5g-2023-cameras-2">Moto G Power 5G 2024 vs. Power 5G 2023: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="AWvT2z9UyC97wNHQBvjpVB" name="Moto-G-Power-5G-2024-G-Power-5G-2023-2.jpg" alt="The Moto G Power 5G 2024 and 2023 side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AWvT2z9UyC97wNHQBvjpVB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3921" height="2206" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a> aren&apos;t known for having particularly competitive cameras, and at $299 and less, you can&apos;t really expect too much out of these cameras. You can, fortunately, get some decent images from both phones as long as you&apos;re somewhere with good lighting, but these aren&apos;t camera champs by any means. Both phones feature 50MP primary cameras that are largely the same, but the differences come from the other cameras.</p><p>The 2023 model comes with rather useless and under-specced depth and macro sensors that you&apos;ll likely ignore much of the time. Meanwhile, the Moto G Power 5G has a secondary ultrawide camera that also doubles as a macro sensor, so you can get the best of both worlds.</p><p>As noted, good lighting gets you good photos, but deviate from that at all, and photos will suffer. Don&apos;t expect a lot of detail, but do expect plenty of noise depending on your shooting conditions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I find that I can&apos;t really choose between the two when it comes to the point-and-shoot output of the main camera. Sometimes, the 2023 model will put out an image with a smidge more saturation and contrast than its successor, and other times I&apos;ll find the Moto G Power 5G 2024 puts out more contrast and saturation. Again, neither camera is particularly strong, but I wouldn&apos;t say that the newer model is any better than its predecessor.</p><p>That said, you still get the extra benefit of the ultrawide sensor, which gives you a different focal length. For that alone, the camera system on the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is already a win.</p><p>Meanwhile, both phones top out at FHD 60Hz when it comes to video capture, something Motorola isn&apos;t particularly strong with. On the plus side, you get the extra benefit of audio zoom, so you can focus the mics on the zoomed-in area in the viewfinder. You also get a Pro camera mode for users who want more control over their shots.</p>

<p>Motorola&apos;s budget phones are becoming more compelling each year, and while there is still some room for improvement, you&apos;re still getting plenty of value with the Moto G Power series. That said, when it comes down to these two models, there&apos;s a clear winner here.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 comes with many of the upgrades that I wish the 2023 model had when it launched, such as NFC, an ultrawide camera, 8GB of RAM, and wireless charging. The vegan leather also adds a premium touch to the phone that you will be hard-pressed to find on another device at this price point.</p><p>Sure, you get double the internal storage on the Moto G Power 5G 2023, but both phones support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD cards</a>, so that&apos;s inconsequential.</p><p>Unless you wanted to save some money and grab last year&apos;s model at a discounted price, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best Android phones you can buy under $300, and you should consider grabbing one if you want to spend no more than that on a phone.</p>

<p>There's a lot to like about the Moto G Power 5G 2024, with plenty of welcome internal upgrades to get excited about. However, it's what's on the outside that counts, and the vegan leather finish looks and feels like this phone should cost more than it does.</p></p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want an awesome phone for under $300; you prioritize battery life and software features in your devices; you want the OnePlus experience for less cash.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you can increase your budget to around $400-$500 (there are some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">considerably better phones</a> in that price range). </p><p>For as little as $150 with activation, you&apos;ll be getting a versatile Android phone with surprisingly smooth performance, loads of battery life with lightning-fast charging, and a vibrant, 6.7-inch 120Hz display.

You might also get better bang for your buck if you spend a little more on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Nothing Phone (2a)</a> or the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-google-pixel-8-can-learn-from-nothing-phone-2a">Google Pixel 8a</a>.

This year-old PSVR 2 launch title still boasts some of the best visuals on the system, but those visuals quickly get a downgrade the moment you start moving. That&apos;s because, like so many PSVR 2 games, Horizon Call of the Mountain actually runs at just 60 frames per second instead of 90 or 120fps.</p>

<p>The problem is that 60fps isn&apos;t fast enough to keep most players from feeling sick, so the game has to use a feature called reprojection that virtually doubles the framerate using a clever algorithm.</p><p>While it sounds good on paper, Sony&apos;s algorithm isn&apos;t as good as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/application-space-warp-samurai-slaughter-house-pc-vr-quest-ports">the one Meta uses</a> on its Quest headsets, and it leaves behind a weird ghosting motion blur look that can be jarring to some players. Rumor has it the PS5 Pro is releasing later this year and will include a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/playstation-5-pro-enhanced-requirements-allegedly-leaked">PS5 Pro Enhanced</a> certification that guarantees minimum framerates for games with the seal. Will this be enough to finally fix the PSVR 2&apos;s framerate problem?</p>
<h2 id="isn-apos-t-the-ps5-already-powerful-enough-2">Isn&apos;t the PS5 already powerful enough?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.01%;"><img id="Sqpkfvi2jpQksGZuFCMFmd" name="horizon-call-of-the-mountain-tallneck-2.jpg" alt="Horizon Call Of The Mountain Tallneck" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sqpkfvi2jpQksGZuFCMFmd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1147" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlayStation)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The PS5 is already nearing its four-year anniversary, marking what some have called the halfway point of its lifecycle. As such, Sony is readying new, more powerful hardware to give the ecosystem a mid-cycle bump. Surprisingly, the PS4 Pro launched just three years into the PS4&apos;s life cycle, while Sony is allegedly waiting an extra year for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Many folks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/developer-reportedly-claims-we-dont-need-a-ps5-pro-heres-why-theyre-wrong">including developers</a>, have wondered why Sony is even bothering with upgraded hardware already. But looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/playstation-5-pro-leak-touts-a-45-performance-uplift-reliable-leaker-confirms-ps5-pro-rumors-about-4x-higher-rt-performance-and-ai-based-pssr-upscaling">leaked performance metrics</a> proves exactly why we need new hardware, particularly for VR games.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is said to render 45% faster than the PS5, including ray-tracing performance up to four times as fast. In total, the PS5 Pro is said to provide 33.5 TFLOPS of FP16 performance — over three times the PS5&apos;s 10.3 TFLOPS. That&apos;s plenty of power to give PSVR 2 games the boost from 60fps to 90fps that many of them so desperately need.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The PS5 Pro reportedly has 3x the raw performance of the PS5 plus AI-upscaling to further boost performance and quality.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What&apos;s more, Sony is reportedly launching a new AI-based upscaling technology called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling. PSSR for short.</p><p>As we&apos;ve seen from technologies like Nvidia&apos;s DLSS, AI upscaling technology can have an unbelievable impact on framerates for games. DLSS 3.5 launched in Spring 2023 with AI-based ray reconstruction, which means that AI is used to determine the final pixel color instead of the graphics card having to do the expensive rendering work to get to that point itself.</p><p>The difference in frame rate with this technology enabled is astounding, as one Cyberpunk 2077 example proves:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1919px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="EgfutdSzd8k83oogWwGTG7" name="nvidia-dlss-comparison-cyberpunk.jpg" alt="Nvidia's demonstration of DLSS 3.5 performance using Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EgfutdSzd8k83oogWwGTG7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1919" height="1079" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nvidia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Too many PSVR 2 games run at 60fps with projection to 120fps, leading to ghosting and motion blur.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Jumping from 20fps to 108fps by just enabling a feature boggles the mind and proves that the rumored PS5 Pro, with its PSSR technology, could achieve the same thing with PSVR 2 games.</p><p>Better yet, this could even mean that games run at a proper 120fps instead of the 90fps intermediary frame rate that I mentioned earlier. This would give PSVR 2 games another clear visual advantage over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> as they would not only look more complex but would also run at a smoother frame rate. By comparison, most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> games target 90fps.</p><p>Up until now, it seemed that the biggest reason PSVR 2 games didn&apos;t reach their maximum visual potential was because of software development tools that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/ps-vr-2-developers-issues-unity-resolution">weren&apos;t ready for primetime</a>. Now, it feels like Sony is finally getting everything in order to make it a good experience. Unfortunately, it may be too little too late for Sony.</p>
<h2 id="but-will-it-save-the-psvr-2-2">But will it save the PSVR 2?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fkaB364W3uSofJbLvcEYTo" name="Sony-PSVR-2-with-Pulse-3D-headphones-side-view.jpeg" alt="The PlayStation VR2 headset with the Pulse 3D wireless headphones placed on top of it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkaB364W3uSofJbLvcEYTo.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My biggest concern is that this still wouldn&apos;t be enough of a shot in the arm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-old-psvr-2-disappointing-missed-opportunity">to make Sony care</a> about the PSVR 2 again. The system initially sold better than the original PSVR, but Sony&apos;s complete lack of first-party support hasn&apos;t convinced gamers they should purchase it over the Meta Quest 3, which has received more support from developers at all levels.</p><p>However, the first-party game issue isn&apos;t just relegated to PSVR 2 games. Gamers have vented frustrations at Sony&apos;s lack of first-party games on the PS5 in general. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1aqlqdg/the_state_of_sonys_first_party_exclusives_ps4_vs/">One Reddit thread</a> compared the PS4&apos;s library of exclusive first-party games compared to the PS5.</p><p>According to the thread, Sony released 10 PS4-exclusive first-party games in the first three years of the system&apos;s life. That compared to the measly three in the PS5&apos;s life begs the question: what the heck is Sony doing?</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sony doesn't seem to be taking first-party development seriously this generation, but that's more than just a PSVR 2 problem.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Those numbers don&apos;t include VR games, either, which makes the list look even more terrible for the PS5. Worse yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-important-update-from-playstation-studios/">Sony just closed</a> its VR-dedicated London Studio and made staff reductions at most other first-party studios across the board.</p><p>Furthermore, Sony confirmed that no major franchises <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sony-no-new-playstation-games-from-major-existing-franchises-this-year">will see new releases in 2024</a>. That doesn&apos;t mean Sony isn&apos;t releasing new games this year; it&apos;s just that its well-known franchises aren&apos;t getting releases this year.</p><p>So, while the technical end of things seems to be getting solved with the addition of tools like foveated rendering, PSSR, and even new hardware like the PS5 Pro, I&apos;m not sure if Sony is invested enough in PSVR 2 development to turn things around.</p><p>As someone who bought a PSVR 2 at launch, I&apos;m fully invested in seeing the system get better support and eventually thrive. Sony will sell a few more PSVR 2 units once the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/psvr-2-pcvr-firmware-update">PCVR support goes live</a>, but that&apos;s not going to sell people on the idea that Sony&apos;s VR ecosystem is the one to invest in without more first-party exclusive titles.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy foldables from Samsung have been the talk of the town lately as they are rumored to launch earlier than their previous models. New information has emerged on what to expect from the bigger Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The book-style foldables from the past have been significantly on the heavier side since their inception; however, this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is tipped to weigh less than the predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, notes prolific leaker Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Galaxy Z Fold6 weighs 239g and finally reaches the first-tier level.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1775426146185957436a">tipster</a> indicated that the Z Fold 6 would weigh 239 grams on the whole, which is significantly less than the previous model, which weighed 256 grams. It is also believed to correspond to the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> (Voyager Black) edition, notes Universe.</p><p>The other interesting details shared by the tipster include the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s thickness when the device is unfolded, measuring 5.6mm, and it will likely measure 12.1mm when folded. The decline is also seen in the overall thickness compared to the predecessor, which measured 6.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively. </p><p>While the internal foldable screen is likely to remain the same, measuring 7.6 inches, the external screen should see modifications, according to the tipster. The cover screen will likely have a new 22:9 aspect ratio next to 6.3 inches, a substantial bump over 6.1 inches from the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The overall screen resolutions are likely to be improved on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 this year as well, notes Ice Universe.</p>

<p>While the new parameters of the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 look promising, so did its renders, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">were leaked</a> in February. They revealed the device in full, including the tipped taller cover screen. Apart from that, the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> packs three rear cameras and a selfie shooter on the external screen; presumably, a hidden selfie camera in the foldable screen is expected.</p><p>Per the renders, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will have pointed corners and squared-off edges on all sides. Also, a recent 3C certification has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-charging-speed-rumor">revealed</a> that the Z Fold 6 owners will still have to settle with boring 25W charging speeds like the predecessor models while the competition is way ahead regarding charging capabilities.</p>

<ul><li>Google previously announced it is bringing Gemini to Gmail for Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>Now, it appears that Google is trying out AI-generated replies from Gemini in the Gmail app for Android.</li><li>Users can tap a reply to edit and send it or let Google know if the responses are bad. Currently, the feature is hidden behind a few developer flags.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After experimenting with Gemini integration in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>, Google appears to be testing AI-generated replies in the Gmail app for Android. Earlier this year, Google announced it was making AI-based features available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscribers in beta. A new implementation of Gemini in the Gmail app has now surfaced, offering three reply suggestions from Gemini for each of your emails.</p><p>Android code expert AssembleDebug was able to enable the feature in the Gmail app, and shared the findings with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/03/google-gemini-gmail-reply-suggestions/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>. Google refers to the tool as "reply suggestions from Gemini," the feature works after flipping some developer flags in Gmail. Once enabled, Gemini can analyze the contents of the email a Gmail user received and come up with three reply suggestions that make sense in context. In some cases, these AI-generated responses from Gemini can be as long as a full sentence or two. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Gemini-powered reply suggestions coming to Gmail📝 More info - https://t.co/AD6wWcEHX1#Android #Gmail #Google pic.twitter.com/c5fVGjWRdd<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1775375003971981509">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>You can act on the suggestions by tapping one of the AI-generated options, which will move its contents to the compose field. After that, you can press the send button to finish your reply. However, you might want to edit the message or add more, possibly after the Gemini-suggested response is moved to the compose field. </p><p>Gemini has already appeared in Gmail but in a different way. Google One AI Premium subscribers can get help creating an email with Gemini, although this functionality is in beta. Help me write in Workspace Labs is another way for users to leverage AI to write messages in Gmail. Compared to these two options, the "reply suggestions from Gemini" serve a different purpose entirely. These suggestions are intended to be quick, pre-written replies that can be sent in as little as two taps in the Gmail app for Android.</p><p>Like many implementations of Gemini, Google wants your feedback when using its AI tools. In some cases, Google will show a "bad suggestions?" action item underneath the suggested replies from Gemini. Tapping on that text will give you the chance to let Google know when the AI-generated replies in Gmail have missed the mark.</p><p>Though the suggested replies from Gemini are available now after manually enabling developer flags, we don&apos;t know when they might be publicly released. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I went all-in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/using-google-chromecast-audio-whole-house-audio-alternative-sonos">Chromecast Audio</a> when Google introduced it nearly a decade ago. I didn&apos;t want to buy smart speakers as that would add another layer of complexity, so I just bought an eclectic mix of speakers and connected everything via Chromecast Audio. While the $35 dongle continues to be terrific, Google moved away from the idea altogether, and curtailed key features.</p><p>That&apos;s where WiiM comes into the picture. WiiM made its debut with the introduction of the Mini, a hockey puck-sized streamer that integrated with all major music streaming services. It would have been the ideal Chromecast Audio alternative, but that product didn&apos;t have the Cast protocol. Thankfully, WiiM introduced the Pro at the same time, and it had Cast integration, a terrific DAC, and all the extras you need in a network streamer.</p>
<p>The WiiM Amp takes things to a whole new level. It has a lot of the same features as the Pro, but you get a better-quality ESS DAC, and there&apos;s built-in audio amplification, making it the obvious choice if you need to power passive speakers. The WiiM Amp is an all-in-one solution that just needs speakers, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H">coming in at just $299</a>, it is a phenomenal value — there really isn&apos;t anything else in this segment that gives you anywhere as many features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nQQsDznVckCzxxztjBhKrL" name="wiim-amp-9.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQQsDznVckCzxxztjBhKrL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. The WiiM Amp is different to the rest of the brand&apos;s products in that it has an all-metal chassis, and the aluminum enclosure exudes elegance. The minimalist design is terrific, and it belies the fact that the WiiM Amp costs just $299. The brushed metal enclosure has rounded edges, a large volume knob at the front, a status LED, and volume indicator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mvV8giuZFcMVBeW2wmuriL" name="wiim-amp-8.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvV8giuZFcMVBeW2wmuriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The volume knob doubles as a control button for music playback, and a long press puts the WiiM Amp into pairing mode. Other than the WiiM logo at the top, you don&apos;t get much in the way of branding. If anything, the WiiM Amp looks more like a Sonos product than the Sonos Amp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vN47JPeCAJMBpzMotmdNnK" name="wiim-amp-2.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vN47JPeCAJMBpzMotmdNnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s at the back where things get exciting, with WiiM offering all the ports you&apos;ll need. There&apos;s optical and analog inputs, along with HDMI ARC, connectors for hooking up passive speakers, USB, Ethernet, and subwoofer out. The inclusion of HDMI ARC makes it a breeze to connect the Amp to your TV, and while there isn&apos;t a headphone out, you get two-way Bluetooth, giving you the option to pair with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JLTuYt3984Tp6K7PgekB7L" name="wiim-amp-4.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLTuYt3984Tp6K7PgekB7L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the connectivity on offer is leagues ahead of everything else in this segment, and that extends to the services the Amp integrates with. You get Chromecast integration along with AirPlay 2 and AirPlay Cast, and you can seamlessly slot it into an existing multi-room audio configuration, whether you use Chromecast or Alexa-enabled devices. It&apos;s this versatility that gives the Amp a distinct edge, and you can set it up as a cast target, giving you the ability to play music via Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AfvsYga47ugMTeB3Byv6wK" name="wiim-amp-3.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfvsYga47ugMTeB3Byv6wK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The features don&apos;t end there; you also get DLNA, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and even Roon integration. The latter is of particular interest to my own use case, as I use Roon extensively to stream music to various devices in my home. More than any other feature, Roon integration allows the Amp to stand out in this segment, and I don&apos;t believe there&apos;s any other network streamer that offers the same at $299.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GqEwzagUH3Wchv4Hc6GaML" name="wiim-amp-6.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GqEwzagUH3Wchv4Hc6GaML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the WiiM Amp is about as straightforward as it gets, and it has a Class D amp that provides 60W per channel at 8Ω and 120W at 4Ω. That&apos;s more than adequate for most passive systems, and I daresay we&apos;ll see another variant of the Amp with better power output, so if you&apos;re using audio gear that&apos;s a bit more demanding, you should hang tight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b7PZ5NqRPkp5ttFn2bTSzL" name="wiim-amp-10.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7PZ5NqRPkp5ttFn2bTSzL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The WiiM Home app is what you&apos;ll use to control music playback and set up the device, and it has a polished interface with plenty of features. You get a 10-band EQ with 26 preset options, and a 4-band parametric EQ. What&apos;s great is that you can set individual EQ profiles to each input. You can also control music playback with the bundled remote.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="krEmoBqx5Ppms4dodRN4GM" name="wiim-amp-11.jpg" alt="WiiM Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krEmoBqx5Ppms4dodRN4GM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the WiiM Amp features an ESS 9018 DAC that is a stalwart in this segment. It does a terrific job with a variety of genres, delivering a sound that&apos;s detailed and engaging. You&apos;ll get a more vibrant sound out of a dedicated amp, but considering all the other features on offer, the WiiM Amp definitely hits well above its weight class in this area.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the WiiM Amp achieves something that very few products manage in the high-res audio segment: offer meaningful differentiation. There isn&apos;t another product in this category that gives you anywhere close to the number of features, and the elegant design is just an added bonus. If you need an amp to drive your existing speakers and want one that looks as good as it sounds, the WiiM Amp is the obvious choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing just launched its budget smartphone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Nothing Phone 2a</a>, early last month. However, the company is already looking ahead to its next product launch, which looks to be a new set of earbuds. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1775478389740015880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1775478389740015880%7Ctwgr%5E8365da155f97f685a7df3a803a2b3daf022e28e7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2024%2F04%2F03%2Fnothing-earbuds-april-teaser%2F" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Nothing posted a cryptic message alongside an image of a black beetle staring at a yellow frog. To find out more, Nothing tells us to wait for the company&apos;s next community update slated for April 18. </p><p>On its own, the post doesn&apos;t give us much to go off of, but this isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen the black beetle. It appeared in teasers and promotional material related to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Nothing Ear 2</a>, which were released in March 2023. Nothing has a history of using bugs to market earbuds, with a ladybug representing the original Nothing Ear. We don&apos;t know what the yellow frog means yet, but it&apos;s reasonable to expect that this teaser has something to do with a new pair of earbuds. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Play Date. Want to hear more?

<p>Nothing could be hinting at a successor to the Nothing Ear 2 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-stick-review">Nothing Ear Stick</a>, as well as a new audio product altogether. Those are the two earbuds currently available from Nothing, but the company also sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/cmf-neckband-pro-and-new-buds-announced">Buds, Buds Pro, and Neckband Pro</a> through the CMF by Nothing sub-brand.</p><p>Separately, Android expert and leaker Dylan Roussel on X posted the codenames of two upcoming Nothing smartphones. One device is codenamed "PacmanPro," while another is known as "Tetris." The Nothing Phone 2a was known internally as Pacman, so the PacmanPro moniker could be referencing a variation of the Phone 2a. Nothing has already publicly revealed that at least one Phone 2a variation is coming through the company&apos;s Community Edition contest, where fans can help design the new model. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PacmanPro - Tetris.Hi Nothing team 👋 https://t.co/fTp4p5UutE<a href="https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1775589958624973253">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>We&apos;ll likely learn more about Nothing&apos;s new audio product later this month at the community update scheduled for April 18. The phones are likely further out, but a prior leak from Roussel claims they will both launch sometime this year. At least one of those devices is expected to be a flagship successor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, which will probably be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-qualcomm-chip-price-rumors">Nothing Phone 3</a>. </p>

<ul><li>A report claims that Spotify is interested in raising the prices of its "basic" by a dollar and its duo plan by $2 in certain markets worldwide.</li><li>Alleged sources state Spotify will also introduce a new basic tier, which will include music and podcasts minus access to audiobooks.</li><li>Spotify's "supremium" tier is still on the way as a brief mention shows it's still under development.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report suggests Spotify is preparing to increase prices for its streaming services and develop new Premium plans.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/spotify-is-changing-how-it-charges-customers-with-new-plans-and-prices?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> states that Spotify is interested in raising the price of its "basic" plan by $1 and its duo service by $2 in certain markets worldwide. Sources claim that the UK, Australia, and Pakistan consumers will see these increases take effect by the end of April.</p><p>The U.S. is also participating in the price hike wave, though it will allegedly take place "later this year."</p><p>The report adds that Spotify is also looking into adding more subscription plans for consumers to drive revenue. Those familiar with the matter said the company is preparing a new "basic" tier with music and podcasts but forgo audiobooks. This plan may cost $11, which is the cost of a Premium plan for a single user.</p><p>There are more "new pricing options" that Spotify is working on, but nothing further was detailed.</p><p>Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan was briefly mentioned, and it looks like the tier is still under development. Users who grab that subscription would be granted HiFi audio for a steeper price.</p><p>Bloomberg states Spotify&apos;s reasoning behind its alleged impending price hike is to "cover the cost of audiobooks." The audio service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify-premium-challenges-audible-monthly-audiobooks">launched audiobooks</a> for Premium users in November 2023. The feature came with over 200,000 titles that users could listen to for "free" for 15 hours per month. You would then have to spend an additional $12.99 to give yourself an extra 10 hours of listening if you exceeded the initial cap.</p><p>Sources state Spotify has only generated revenue from users who have exceeded the initial allotted time for listening per month. The service then added an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-audiobook-access-tier-rollout">Access</a>" tier that was cheaper for bookworms.</p><p>We&apos;ve been waiting on Spotify&apos;s "supremium" plan for a while, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-supremium-logo-features-rumor">the latest leaks</a> came in October 2023. It was suggested that not only would users receive HiFi (high fidelity) audio, but "Your Sound Capsule," "Highlights," and 24-bit lossless audio would join in.</p>

<p>We&apos;re virtually a week into the reception of One UI 6.1 for Samsung&apos;s past-gen devices, and a couple of glaring problems are appearing.</p><p>Users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1bql7sw/fingerprint_issue_after_one_ui_61_update/">taken to Reddit</a> to report problems with the biometrics (fingerprint) reader of their Galaxy S23 Ultra following One UI 6.1 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/03/galaxy-s23-fingerprint-sensor-one-ui-6-1-update/">9to5Google</a>).

<p>There could be some good news here as we&apos;re just getting into April, which means Samsung will start pushing this month&apos;s security patch to its slew of devices. The Galaxy S24 started receiving it quite early, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">at the end of March</a>. Perhaps Samsung will delay its April patch for the Galaxy S23 series to work in a fix. If not, users may have to wait until May before seeing relief.</p><p>Samsung started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> packed with Galaxy AI features to its past-gen devices on March 28 in the U.S. The entire Galaxy S23 series was eligible for the update, which notably involves the devices users have reported problems with since the update became available. Galaxy AI&apos;s features also graced the Galaxy Z Flip 5, Fold 5, and Tab S9 series.</p><p>Users of these devices can now access Google&apos;s "Circle to Search," Live Translate, Chat Assist, and more.</p>

<ul><li>Hidden features in Android 15's latest developer preview suggest a potential revamp for icons like battery and Wi-Fi signals.</li><li>Google may introduce a horizontal battery icon to accommodate the battery level indicator within it.</li><li>There might also be improvements in haptic feedback for various interactions in Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is not expected to have major visual overhauls, Google appears to be brewing some nice tweaks for the next mobile update, such as snazzier status bar icons and more.</p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-new-status-bar-3430578/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, did some digging and unlocked some hidden features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">Android 15&apos;s second developer preview</a>. Apparently, Google might be revamping the icons at the top of your screen, like the battery and Wi-Fi signals.</p><p>Instead of the usual smooth icons, these new ones would be broken into segments, making it easier to see how strong your connection is at a glance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google might flip the battery icon on its side, going from vertical to horizontal. This change means the battery level indicator can fit right inside the battery icon instead of next to it. But if you&apos;re not feeling it, you can always turn that off.</p>

<p>These tweaks might seem minor, but for users who prefer getting quick and clear information at a glance, they could come in really handy.</p><p>In the current version of Android, the icons for Wi-Fi, cellular signal, and battery life are just simple bars that fill up depending on how strong they are. They also turn white or dark, depending on your phone&apos;s theme. A separate spot shows the battery percentage, but you might have to turn that on in your settings.</p><p>Rahman also mentions that Google is stepping up the haptic feedback game in Android 15. So, when you tap or hold down on a quick settings toggle in the notification shade, you&apos;ll feel a slight vibration. And it doesn&apos;t stop there—when you slide the volume up or down using touch, thanks to the brightness adjuster, you&apos;ll feel that feedback, too.</p><p>These new features are currently hidden in a special testing version of Android 15 meant for developers (it is not super stable, so avoid putting it on your main phone). We&apos;ll have to wait for the official Android 15 release to see if Google decides to include these tweaks.</p>
