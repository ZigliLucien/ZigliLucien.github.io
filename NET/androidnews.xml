                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Motorola Smart Connect is Motorola&apos;s clever way of linking all your devices together in a way that feels not just cohesive and smart, but <em>magical</em>. The app used to be called "Ready For" and was rebranded to Motorola Smart Connect at MWC 2024, bringing new features along for the ride.</p><p>Motorola Smart Connect enables a host of impressive ways for your phone to interact with your laptop and tablet including app streaming, mobile desktop, phone on PC, using your phone as a webcam, sharing a clipboard, cross-device mouse and keyboard control, and even a quick way to share an internet connection or files.</p><p>In essence, it&apos;s the best way to connect all your devices in the most convenient way possible. To get started, you&apos;ll need a Windows-based PC and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a>. You can also pair either of these devices with a Lenovo tablet of your choice.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-installing-motorola-smart-connect"><span>Installing Motorola Smart Connect</span></h3>
<p>Motorola Smart Connect should already be installed on your Motorola smartphone or Lenovo tablet, but just in case it&apos;s not, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motorola.mobiledesktop">download it from the Play Store</a> for free. The app will only work on Motorola and Lenovo-approved devices. If you&apos;re not sure if that&apos;s your particular phone or tablet, click the Play Store link and it&apos;ll tell you.</p><p>On a Windows PC, you&apos;ll need to install the Motorola Smart Connect software <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp8jrf5sxv03zm">from the Microsoft app store</a>. It&apos;s also a free app and takes a few seconds to install. Once you have those apps installed, follow these steps to connect your PC to your phone or tablet:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Smart Connect on your PC</strong>. Optionally, you may sign into a Motorola account but it&apos;s not required for pairing.</p><p>2. Open the <strong>Smart Connect app</strong> on your phone or tablet.</p><p>3. On your phone or tablet, tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under the pair a device heading.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>PC</strong> from the list of devices to pair to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.14%;"><img id="Wxnt5muwLruP7PtNibnSci" name="motorola-smart-connect-setup.jpg" alt="Connecting a Motorola smartphone with a Windows PC using Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wxnt5muwLruP7PtNibnSci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="986" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. <strong>Accept any permissions</strong> needed to run the Smart Connect service.</p><p>6. Use the App&apos;s QR Code scanner to <strong>scan the QR code</strong> on your PC&apos;s Smart Connect app.</p><p>7. <strong>Accept the pairing request</strong> on both devices.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-smart-clipboard"><span>Smart clipboard</span></h3>
<p>The first thing I would recommend setting up is Smart Clipboard. This allows your phone and PC to share a clipboard, so when you copy something on one device you can effortlessly paste it on another device.</p><p>To enable Smart Clipboard, open up the Smart Connect app on either your phone or PC and tap <strong>Smart clipboard</strong>. Accept any permissions prompts that appear to enable the feature.</p><p>Once enabled, you can <strong>view your shared clipboard</strong> by opening the Smart Connect app, and then tapping Smart clipboard. All of your most recent copied items, including text and pictures, can be found here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.41%;"><img id="wiZmwknwomDh4Wh4w6fd3j" name="motorola-smart-connect-clipboard.jpg" alt="Using the smart clipboard feature on Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiZmwknwomDh4Wh4w6fd3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="971" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When copying something on your PC, a small pop-up should appear on the bottom-left corner of your phone or tablet&apos;s screen. Tapping this pop-up will let you see the clipboard contents and even let you edit text.</p><p>There are also several <strong>alternative ways of viewing a shared clipboard</strong> on each device. On your Windows PC, hold the Windows Key and press the V key to open the clipboard manager. On your Android phone or tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks#section-use-gboard-s-clipboard-feature">clipboard feature</a> makes it easy to scroll through your clipboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3234px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.65%;"><img id="Hmqeq6NnKERXHGX5FFNtWa" name="gboard-clipboard-1.jpg" alt="Clipboard feature in Gboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hmqeq6NnKERXHGX5FFNtWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3234" height="2382" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-cross-control"><span>Cross control</span></h3>
<p>Cross control allows you to use the same keyboard and mouse between all your connected devices. It effectively turns all your screens into one big device so you can easily click and type without having to pick the mobile devices up. This is my favorite feature of Smart Connect as it makes it easier to respond to messages without having to interrupt my workflow.</p><p>To enable Cross control, tap the <strong>Cross control</strong> button in the Motorola Smart Connect app on <em>either</em> your phone, tablet, or PC. Then, tap <strong>Start Cross control</strong> to get it going.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:796px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.54%;"><img id="VRxrjho7bjqv4m8tP3w8Lb" name="motorola-smart-connect-cross-control.jpg" alt="Configuring virtual monitors and devices in Cross Control on the Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VRxrjho7bjqv4m8tP3w8Lb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="796" height="657" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once it&apos;s enabled, you may want to adjust the virtual position of your phone or tablet relative to your PC. This is identical to adjusting where your monitors are located so it&apos;s easy to move your mouse between screens, but you&apos;ll need to do it through the Motorola Smart Connect app instead of via the Windows system dialog.</p><p>To adjust the position of where your phone is virtually located relative to your PC&apos;s monitors, open the Smart Connect app <strong>on your PC</strong>, then click <strong>Cross control</strong>. From here, click and drag your smartphone or tablet&apos;s display icon and place it where it makes the most sense. I like to have mine off to the right side as seen in the image above.</p><p>Once this is done, you can drag your mouse between your phone, tablet, and PC monitors as if they were all running on one device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-your-phone-as-a-webcam"><span>Use your phone as a webcam</span></h3>
<p>Some laptops have decent enough webcams, but the camera on your smartphone or tablet is almost certainly higher quality. Motorola Smart Connect lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-device-camera-to-be-used-as-webcam-on-windows-11">use your phone&apos;s camera as a webcam</a> for your meetings or other video recording needs on a PC, improving the quality beyond what&apos;s on your PC.</p><p>To get started, open up the Motorola Smart Connect app on your phone or PC, tap the <strong>Webcam</strong> <strong>button</strong>, and then click <strong>open webcam</strong>. For the first launch, you&apos;ll need to click the <strong>Install</strong> button on your PC to install the webcam drivers.</p><p>Once this is done, click the <strong>Webcam button</strong>, then click <strong>open webcam. </strong>Tap the <strong>accept button</strong> on your phone to begin the webcam stream.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="B7bHpPQwQjdfk2VV8ufC3S" name="spigen-o-mag-ring-webcam-mount-on-monitor-using-motorola-edge-plus-2023.jpg" alt="Using the Spigen O-Mag Ring phone webcam mount with a Motorola Edge Plus (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7bHpPQwQjdfk2VV8ufC3S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the webcam feature uses the rear camera on your smartphone. If you want to switch to the front camera, tap the <strong>swap icon</strong> underneath the camera zoom button. It looks like two arrows moving in a circle.</p><p>If you&apos;re using the rear camera, you can turn on the flash as a fill light by tapping the <strong>studio light button</strong>. This feature is not available on the front camera.</p><p>To end the webcam session, tap the<strong> blue camera icon</strong> on the bottom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1085px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.06%;"><img id="w7AHNc6MADyPJKQq8fARWD" name="motorola-smart-connect-webcam.jpg" alt="Using the webcam function on Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w7AHNc6MADyPJKQq8fARWD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1085" height="912" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you find yourself enjoying the webcam feature and want to use it all the time, I recommend picking up this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/iphone-magsafe-spigen-ring-on-android-phone">smartphone webcam mount</a> for a few bucks. It&apos;s fantastic and makes it easy to mount the phone on the top of your monitor or laptop display.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-sharing-files"><span>Sharing files</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="q5CS6Jfhk77XWT5tvTo4bb" name="motorola-smart-connect-files.jpg" alt="Browsing files on a Motorola smart phone using Motorola Smart Connect software" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5CS6Jfhk77XWT5tvTo4bb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1410" height="795" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola offers several ways to easily share files between your smartphone, PC, and tablet. The easiest is to launch the <strong>Share Hub</strong> by clicking the Share Hub button when you open Motorola Smart Connect. This will bring up a small floating window on your PC that you can drag any media, text, or files to in order to transfer it to your phone.</p><p>On the phone, you can share content with your PC by clicking the share button in any app, and then tapping the <strong>File share</strong> option in the top row of icons. After that <strong>select your PC</strong> from the list of shared devices.</p><p>You can also view the files on your phone as if it were another drive on your PC by tapping the <strong>Files button</strong> in Motorola Smart Connect. This will bring up a Windows Explorer window with your phone&apos;s files for easy and familiar file management.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-app-streaming-and-mobile-desktop"><span>App streaming and mobile desktop</span></h3>
<p>Motorla Smart Connect lets you stream your phone&apos;s apps right to your desktop in several different ways. You can choose to stream individual apps or even to use your phone like a desktop computer.</p><p>Streaming individual apps is great for when you just want to interact with one app at a time, as the feature pops up apps in separate windows on your PC. To access the feature, tap the <strong>App streaming</strong> button in the Motorola Smart Connect software on your PC, then select an app to stream.</p><p>Streamed apps run independently from your smartphone, which means that you can stream phone apps to your PC and still use your smartphone normally. The streamed app doesn&apos;t appear on your phone&apos;s screen at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cDqw7MvPjJWJJe9BwR6Yrg" name="motorola-smart-connect-app-streaming-vs-mobile-desktop.jpg" alt="App streaming vs mobile desktop on Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDqw7MvPjJWJJe9BwR6Yrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;d like a more full-fledged experience, tapping the <strong>Phone on PC</strong> or <strong>Mobile Desktop</strong> options will give you full access to your entire smartphone. Selecting Phone on PC gives you two options: mirroring your smartphone exactly, or creating a virtual phone.</p><p>Mirroring the phone does exactly what it sounds like. You&apos;ll see the phone exactly as it is in your hand, and any interactions you make on your PC will be seen on the smartphone screen.</p><p>Conversely, using the virtual phone option "clones" your phone experience so actions you perform on the virtual phone on your PC don&apos;t occur on your physical smartphone, even though those actions are happening behind the scenes.</p><p>Mobile Desktop is similar to the virtual phone option except that it displays an entire horizontal desktop-style UI instead of a tall phone display. This is great for use on a secondary monitor and lets you use every app on your smartphone with floating windows as if it were a desktop PC.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Pixel 6 users are experiencing serious issues with factory resets that brick their phones.</li><li>The error message "Cannot load Android system" appears after a reset, suggesting corrupted data and prompting another reset, which doesn't solve the problem.</li><li>Google is aware of the problem and is investigating, but a fix is not yet available.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 6 users are dealing with a new software hiccup that&apos;s causing some serious headaches. During a factory reset, some phones are hitting a critical error, turning them into fancy paperweights.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> owners have reported on Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/281577056?hl=en&msgid=282534526" target="_blank">support forums</a> that their phones became bricked after a factory reset, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/pixel-6-bricking-after-factory-reset-google-investigating/" target="_blank">Tech-Issues Today</a>. Google is aware of the problem and is looking into it, as per a comment on the forums.</p><p>In the forum thread, Pixel 6 users reported that after they tried to reset their devices, the phones failed to boot up properly and instead showed an error message: "Cannot load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:563px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.21%;"><img id="pdPg7xneEa2TjEYJ9AHwP8" name="pixel-6-bricked.jpg" alt="pixel 6 bricked after factory reset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdPg7xneEa2TjEYJ9AHwP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="563" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit:  sadge pixel / Google Pixel Phone forum)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When users encounter the error message, they&apos;re given the option to "try again," but this attempt often proves futile. Additional factory reset attempts may bring up even more alarming messages, such as missing a critical file named "tune2fs" or failing to "enable ext4 verify," both essential for the phone&apos;s file system integrity.</p><p>The reference to "tune2fs" hints at deeper issues within the system tools managing the phone&apos;s storage.</p><p>It looks like this isn&apos;t just a one-time glitch. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1dm79u3/pixel_6_bricked_after_wipe_to_factory_reset_error/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> are also reporting their Pixel 6 phones getting bricked after factory resets. Even Google’s recovery tools aren’t able to fix the problem.</p><p>We have reached out to Google for a statement and will update this article when we receive a response.</p><p>Even though Google is aware of the issue, a fix is still in the works. So, Pixel 6 series users should be extra cautious. It&apos;s best to avoid any factory resets on your Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a until Google rolls out a solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, this problem isn&apos;t new. Pixel users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-bugs">have long dealt with software issues</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">undermine the positive experience</a> these devices aim to provide. Until Google tackles these persistent bugs, frustration is likely to persist among some Pixel users.</p>

<ul><li>The July 2024 update is currently rolling out for Pixel Watch models.</li><li>The update doesn't include any notable features, fixes, or additions, but brings the latest security patch level.</li><li>The update will arrive on watches over the next week, depending on carrier and device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is kicking off July with new updates for its devices, and Pixel Watch owners can expect a new one to hit their watches any moment now. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/283026174/google-pixel-watch-update-july-2024">announced</a> on Monday that the July 2024 update is rolling out to Pixel Watch devices starting now and should reach models over the next week.</p><p>The rollout will happen in phases, so your Pixel Watch may not receive the update immediately, as it will depend on carrier and device. That said, this update isn&apos;t one you should have to rush for, so you shouldn&apos;t worry about grabbing it sooner rather than later.</p><p>According to Google&apos;s blog post, the update doesn&apos;t bring any new features, fixes, or enhancements. Instead, all you&apos;ll find is a bump to the latest July 2024 security patch, which should help keep your Pixel Watch secure.</p><p>The update is available for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, and it comes with software version <strong>TWD9.240705.001.A1</strong>.</p>

<p>The update comes only a few weeks after Google pushed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-june-2024-update">June 2024 update</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">feature drop</a> to Pixel smartwatches, which brought car crash detection, enhanced fall detection, and more. Pixel Watch users with tattoos should also notice improved on/off body detection, which should be especially helpful if they have passcodes on their watches.</p><p>It was previously reported that the June 2024 update may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/june-feature-update-could-be-draining-your-pixel-watch-quicker">causing battery drain issues</a> on Pixel Watch models, although it&apos;s not clear if this update addresses that or not.</p><p>To <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-update-pixel-watch">update your Pixel Watch</a>, or at least to check if the update is available, navigate to <strong>Settings > System > System updates</strong>. You may be prompted to place your watch on the charger for the update to install.</p><p>As noted, the July 2024 update may not be available for your watch just yet, but you can always try opening the update page on your Pixel Watch and repeatedly tapping the watch icon to refresh the page.</p><p>So far, at least one of our Pixel Watch 2 models has received the July 2024 update.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re a little over a week from Samsung&apos;s summer Unpacked event, and the full specs sheet for its new watches has leaked.</p><p>The full spec sheet for the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 was detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-et-ultra-on-vous-devoile-les-caracteristiques-integrales-et-prix-valables-en-france-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-samsung-54425">Dealabs</a>, alongside some potential colors. The larger Ultra model will seemingly debut with a 1.5-inch 480x480 resolution Super AMOLED display. Rumors state the device will arrive in one 47mm size option with 47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1 mm dimensions.</p><p>Internally, the sheet adds that the Ultra variant could feature the Exynos W1000 chipset with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Samsung&apos;s version of Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/first-one-ui-6-watch-beta-hits-us-galaxy-watches">One UI Watch 6</a>, is said to greet users out of the box.</p><p>A 590mAh battery with fast charging capabilities was highlighted, as well. Users might expect NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, 4G, Wi-Fi 2.4GHz, and 5GHz connectivity options. For its sensors, the alleged spec sheet purports a GPS, light and geomagnetic sensors, gyroscope, barometer, BioActive, temperature, and heart rate sensors.</p><p>IP6X dust resistance rating and 10 ATM waterproofing round out the alleged specifications for the Watch Ultra.</p><p>The publication adds that the colors of the device (at least, in France) include Titanium Gray, Titanium White, and Titanium Silver for its 47mm size. The device is also rumored to snag a €699 price tag in France, roughly $750. It&apos;s worth noting that pricing is always tricky, and Samsung will likely adjust it accordingly for each region.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is rumored to feature the same lineup of sensors as its Ultra sibling. However, the sheet states consumers might see two size variants: 40mm and 44mm. The former could see a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display while the latter could sport a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED like the larger model. The same Exynos SoC is supposedly featured in the watch, too.</p><p>The Watch 7&apos;s RAM and storage options are the same, while differences arise for its battery. The smaller 40mm could see a 300mAh capacity, while the 44mm nets a 425mAh battery. These sizes are similar to last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>.</p><p>The post adds that the Watch 7 could feature the same IP6X dust resistance, but its waterproofing is rated at 5 ATM.</p><p>The base model&apos;s 40mm variant with Bluetooth is said to offer green and cream options for €319 (~$342). Its 44mm option with green and silver colorways might land at €349 (~$374). The sheet suggests that its 40mm Bluetooth/4G version could snag a €369 (~$395) price tag, while its 44mm could be offered for €399 (~$428).</p><p>The Watch 7 popped up on Amazon&apos;s retail listing with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-amazon-listing-leak">sneak peek at a few features</a>. The BioActive sensor remains consistent between the two leaks, though the Amazon listing mentioned a "Daily AI Companion," which likely references Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI. Alongside similar colors, the listing stated that consumers could expect their Watch 7 by July 16, only six days after Unpacked.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy Watch Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-buds-3-series-render-leak">recently appeared</a> in some official-looking renders with the Buds 3 series. From the now-removed images, the Watch Ultra was seen with a rugged band, a squarish body, and a circular watch face with multiple physical buttons.</p><p>Samsung confirmed that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">summer Unpacked event</a> will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, and consumers can begin reserving their devices.</p>

<ul><li>Android 15 Beta 3.1 is rolling out to all eligible Android beta participants via an over-the-air update.</li><li>The update fixes two particularly egregious bugs, one which prevented face unlock usage and the other that cause lockscreen interaction to sometimes break.</li><li>This update doesn't appear to fix the slow charging bug that appeared in Android 15 Beta 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re on Android 15 Beta 3 and have trouble unlocking your phone or interacting with elements on the lock screen, the latest update should make you very happy. Android 15 Beta 3.1 is rolling out to eligible phones right now.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in testing it out, here&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">how to install the Android 15 beta</a> on your supported phone.</p><p>This beta update features a fairly short list of fixes but two, in particular, are quite important. Lockscreen widgets were nigh unusable at times as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">Android 15 beta 3</a> would constantly prompt users to unlock their phones in order to interact with elements on the lockscreen. That totally defeats the point of having interactable elements on a lock screen, but thankfully, that bug has been squashed.</p><p>On the other hand, there were times when biometric face unlock didn&apos;t work in Android 15 beta 3. When this failed, though, users could still use a PIN, password, or fingerprint unlock, so while it was annoying, it wasn&apos;t experience-breaking.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes">full list of changes</a> doesn&apos;t provide much information on additional fixes other than "fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and audio quality."</p><p>Currently, the most problematic bug seems to have broken adaptive charging on Pixel devices, meaning it takes <em>hours</em> to charge Pixel phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1djxio0/charging_issue_after_update_my_8a_to_android_15/">users on Reddit</a>, overnight charging is also bugged as users have been finding that their phones still aren&apos;t charged by the time their wake-up timer goes off in the morning.</p><p>Google&apos;s smart charging solution is designed to charge your phone just before the alarm goes off so it&apos;s not sitting at 100% charge all night. There&apos;s no word yet on when this bug will get fixed. Android 15 Beta 3 rolled out on June 18, so it&apos;s possible we&apos;ll see another batch of fixes in another two weeks.</p>

<p>AI is swiftly entering all creative industries, as generative AI is capable of creating text, photos, videos, and even music. Google, a heavy participant in the AI race, is looking for ways to train its models to perform various tasks, including music generation. For this to work, Google needs source material to train AI models with, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> wants to partner with record labels to get it. </p><p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">already has a Dream Track feature</a> that is based on the work of nine artists. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2d9472d-32e0-43f5-8109-efb753fac330" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> reports that YouTube is in talks with record labels Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Records. A potential deal would involve YouTube paying “lump sums of cash” for the right to use the labels’ songs for AI music training. In a statement, YouTube told the Financial Times that it was “in conversations with labels about other experiments” but was not planning to grow Dream Track specifically. </p><p>It’s unclear whether copyrighted material can be used to train AI models, at least from a legal standpoint. We’ll have an answer to this dilemma eventually because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">New York Times sued OpenAI</a> last year for infringing on its copyright by using the Times’ articles to train AI models. </p><p>For now, companies that train their AI models face a high-risk and high-reward scenario. Using copyrighted material to train AI models could drastically accelerate their growth, but it could also open companies up to liability if the courts rule in favor of copyright holders like the New York Times.</p><p>The safe bet is to try and strike deals directly with copyright holders to compensate them for AI model training based on their content. In many cases, that’s exactly what Google is doing. By striking a deal with record labels themselves, YouTube would be able to use select tracks, albums, or catalogs—whatever is specified in the agreement—to train AI models and provide certain features without legal ramifications. </p><p>That’s significant because the legal ramifications could be massive. In one lawsuit, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued Suno and Udio—two AI music generation tools—for copyright infringement and asked for $150,000 in damages per violation, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/record-labels-sue-music-generators-suno-and-udio-1235042056/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>. The RIAA is a force in the music industry, representing the biggest record labels, including the ones YouTube wants to strike a deal with, like UMG.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The specifics on what YouTube features will require AI music training are unclear; however, generative AI music creation makes sense for the platform. YouTube has stringent copyright restrictions that limit what kind of music can be used in videos. YouTube videos with unauthorized use of copyright materials could be pulled entirely, suffer a loss of monetization, or result in a copyright strike on the posted channel.  </p><p>There are certainly ways to use music in YouTube videos. The easiest one is to find royalty-free music that is free to use in other works, usually with the provision or request that credit is given to the original creator. Still, it’s quite difficult to safely use music that you didn’t create yourself on YouTube. </p><p>AI music generation features could fix that, offering a way to create original background music for YouTube videos with zero risk of copyright implications. As such, it’s easy to see why YouTube would want to work with the major record labels.</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-the-record-labels-that-should-back-out-2">It’s the record labels that should back out</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="MNCR5i4Bt6Kn3tnttXyUEd" name="youtube-premium-up-close-galaxy-z-fold-3.jpg" alt="Youtube Premium Up Close Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNCR5i4Bt6Kn3tnttXyUEd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s perfectly clear why YouTube wants to pay record labels to license their content for AI training purposes. However, the record labels should refuse the offer. We don’t know how much YouTube is offering, but it really doesn’t matter. YouTube could give an artist or label a blank check, and they should still leave it on the table. </p><p>Right now, it’s impossible to put a price tag on creativity. Music generation tools can perform a few tricks, and they’re a great way for people who aren’t musically inclined to dabble with song creation. However, the current crop of tools has nothing on professional musicians. Most that are available today either rely on the likeness of popular singers or create something that pales in comparison to that which could be made by a human.</p><p>It’s possible—maybe even plausible—that generative AI can become so great at music generation that it replaces artists. I’m doubtful, but I’ll never bet against technology. Regardless of whether generative AI gets better at creating music, record labels and artists certainly shouldn’t help it.</p><p>A quick influx of cash might be helpful in the short run, especially as the music industry is struggling to adjust to the finances of streaming. However, it won’t be better in the long run. Once the door is open to AI music training, it can’t ever be closed. It might be tough to earn less than a penny from music streams today, but it’ll be even harder to watch AI music get created by models trained on human tracks without receiving any royalties in return. </p><p>There is precedent for record labels working with Google to ship generative AI features—after all, that’s how Dream Track was made possible in the first place. But if I was running a record label, I’d follow in the RIAA’s footsteps without thinking twice. Record labels shouldn’t give up the music in their portfolio to be used for AI training without putting up a massive fight first.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests Samsung might shy away from a base model with the Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://n.news.naver.com/article/025/0003370334?sid=101">Naver</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly preparing to begin manufacturing its next tab series, consisting of the Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/there_wont_be_a_vanilla_galaxy_tab_s10_rumor_claims-news-63519.php">GSMArena</a>). Sources claim that Samsung estimates a total of 25 million tablets sold this year, which could be thanks to its shift away from a base Tab S10. </p><p>Moreover, this departure might enable it to improve the Plus and Ultra variants. Samsung is supposedly moving toward a larger AMOLED screen, beginning at 12 inches, and with plans to go higher</p><p>Rumors claim that Samsung is moving toward a double chipset mentality, similar to its behavior with the Galaxy S24 series. The publication adds that the Korean OEM could plug a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">MediaTek chip</a> into the tablet in some regions while others could grab Qualcomm&apos;s tech.</p><p>Lastly, with rumors suggesting Samsung is beginning to kickstart the manufacturing process of the Tab S10 series now, an imminent launch is unlikely. The post states that Samsung could launch its 2024 tablets "in the second half of the year."</p>

<p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">supposed leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra popped up in June, showing a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9</a> design. The device is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display, which could keep Samsung at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> list in terms of size. The back panel showed a vertical dual camera array like its predecessor. The maximum RAM/storage options are rumored to be 16GB and 1TB.</p><p>Additionally, those previous rumors suggested Samsung could opt for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon X Elite SoC, considering its shifts to compete with Apple.</p><p>Even though Samsung&apos;s tablets will likely miss out on its summer Unpacked, there&apos;s still a lot to expect. The company should debut its Galaxy Ring, next-gen foldables, and its upcoming Watch 7 series. Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">Samsung confirmed</a> that its event will take place on July 10 in Paris, France, at 9 a.m. EDT, with its reserve program already underway.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is updating its smart home device ecosystem with support for the latest Matter iteration.</p><p>Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-simplifies-smart-home-experience-with-latest-app-updates/">the company&apos;s highlights</a>, the reception of Matter 1.2 SDK support for SmartThings is a notable headliner. The latest update brings a "streamlined" developer experience for those looking to improve device integration.</p><p>Moreover, the update brings more devices to Samsung&apos;s ecosystem, such as refrigerators, room air conditioners, dishwashers, laundry washing machines, robotic vacuums, air purifiers, fans, and more. Moving forward, other companies featuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2</a> support for these devices will pair with Samsung SmartThings.</p><p>The company informs users that full support for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> version will hit the app "later this summer."</p><p>Samsung adds that it has improved the "reliability" of its devices through the new Hub Manager. This centralized hub lets users create "Hub Groups" to configure their home&apos;s smart device infrastructure while also enabling Hub Backup, which will let users designate secondary hubs in case the first one falters. Troubleshooting assistance and the ability to transfer device configurations, network settings, and more will await users. </p>

<p>The ability to share your daily smart home routines will soon arrive for SmartThings homes. Samsung states folks can copy and share their custom-created routines for devices with family and guests. Shareable Routines can involve a string of devices that turn on one after another in the morning or whenever.</p><p>Users can share a routine by displaying the QR code for scanning.</p><p>A few smaller updates are included, such as better device controls. Samsung states its device cards are larger to show more of an item&apos;s controls to users. Additionally, you&apos;ll be able to select a smart home device and create a custom home control page to make things easier. New controls involve your TV&apos;s volume and light brightness. Mobile and tablet users can quickly find Device Control through the quick panel.</p><p>Samsung is reworking the UI of its SmartThings app, bringing changes to the device tab. It states the changes will "display rooms as top-level tabs" so users can find what they need and make changes without using too much time.</p><p>Door locks will be visualized in the app, as well as a notification to inform users if a device&apos;s battery has dropped below 15%.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.75%;"><img id="8cucDHBRi2FMtPUwBbKKyY" name="matter-logo.jpg" alt="Matter Logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cucDHBRi2FMtPUwBbKKyY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Business Wire)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung then detailed that its coming SmartThings update will include ways to help users save energy. The app is picking up "gamified" energy level elements and activity badges.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> became available to device creators late in 2023. The update brought support to nine more devices, similar to what Samsung has detailed today (July 1). So long as those devices feature 1.2 support, users can control them through SmartThings regardless of the maker. The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) detailed that it improved device colors and descriptions alongside some other smaller items.</p><p>With Matter 1.2 preparing to arrive for Samsung, the CSA already detailed what&apos;s new for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">1.3 upgrade</a>. Several more home appliances such as stoves and dryers will be supported, alongside EV chargers.</p>

The KA series delivers stellar value in this area, with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka3-portable-dac-review">KA3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka5-review">KA5</a> offering plenty of power in a tiny chassis.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ka11-review">KA11</a> debuted last year to much fanfare, and at just $29, it became the most affordable DAC in Fiio&apos;s extensive catalog — until now. The Chinese brand has now introduced the JA11, and this dongle DAC is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007168009481.html">available at just $15</a>, or half the cost of the KA11. Obviously, I was keen to take a look at the JA11 and see how it holds up against the KA11 and the KA3.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DfyRCYTHPkbmFo7kiugy4j" name="fiio-ja11-3.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfyRCYTHPkbmFo7kiugy4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KA11 by itself is tiny, and the JA11 is roughly half its size; this is basically the same size as a regular 3.5mm to USB-C dongle. The JA11 is also sold under the Jade Audio label, and that&apos;s understandable given its entry-level asking price. As such, you don&apos;t get any Fiio branding on the product; there&apos;s just a Jade Audio logo on the casing of the 3.5mm connector.</p>

<p>The USB-C connector and the DAC housing are made out of aluminum, and they&apos;re connected by a braided cable made out of silicone and yarn; the build quality is much better than anything else you&apos;ll find in this segment. It&apos;s available in white and black versions, and after three weeks of extensive use, I didn&apos;t see any issues with my unit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WT3XjSCzjm8NmAYoioMyZk" name="fiio-ja11-6.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WT3XjSCzjm8NmAYoioMyZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the KA11 is available in both USB-C and Lightning models, the JA11 is limited to USB-C, and Fiio doesn&apos;t have any plans to launch a Lightning-enabled option anytime soon. That limits its usability with older iPhones, but I tested the USB-C model with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, and it connected seamlessly. It also pairs with Windows and macOS devices in addition to Android, and in this regard, it is extremely versatile — you don&apos;t need any drivers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t97YMZZ9JsdBHhVG4Eq7vi" name="fiio-ja11-1.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t97YMZZ9JsdBHhVG4Eq7vi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio usually bundles its products in a distinctive package, but the JA11 comes in a green plastic pouch, and you don&apos;t get any accessories along with it — that&apos;s understandable given what it costs. At just 5g in weight, the JA11 is small and light enough that you don&apos;t feel it; the USB-C cable I use to charge my phone weighs four times as much.</p><p>Coming to the sound, the JA11 has 32-bit/384KHz PCM and DSD128 decoding, and it facilitates inline controls and a mic, so if you&apos;re connecting earbuds that have this feature, they will work seamlessly. As the dongle DAC uses an integrated DAC chip, it isn&apos;t able to deliver quite as much power as its siblings; it goes up to 45mW at 16Ω and 30mW at 32Ω, which is less than a sixth of the 200mW the KA11 produces at 32Ω.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueCaYJMkWEn8jxp38jjYWj" name="fiio-ja11-8.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueCaYJMkWEn8jxp38jjYWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I didn&apos;t have any issues pairing the DAC with most IEMs; I tested it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie200-review">Sennheiser IE200</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa7s-review">Fiio&apos;s FA7S</a> and the all-new FD15, and 7Hz Legato, and it did an admirable job providing adequate power. If you&apos;re using a demanding headset, you should get the KA11 instead, but if you just need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">dongle DAC</a> to use with IEMs, the JA11 holds up astonishingly well.</p>
<p>The one issue I had with the JA11 was that it needed an update out of the box; the DAC has stereo balance issues, and Fiio released the 1.7 build to address this. So before you start using the DAC, you&apos;ll need to connect it to Windows and use the provided tool to install the build.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pw7jFhVQD9JxxnmaGs6Dgj" name="fiio-ja11-7.jpg" alt="Fiio JA11 USB-C DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pw7jFhVQD9JxxnmaGs6Dgj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest highlight of the JA11 is that it has PEQ tuning; Fiio is all about this feature in 2024 after introducing it on the K19, and it works astonishingly well. You pair the DAC to Fiio Control on Android, and you get extensive access to tweak the sound profile to your liking. There are presets available, and you can set up your own and share profiles with other users.</p><p>Just like other Fiio dongle DACs, the JA11 has a neutral sound without much in the way of exaggeration, but the ability to adjust the EQ curve allows you to dynamically change the sound to your liking. In this regard, the JA11 has a distinct edge over the rest of the brand&apos;s portable products, and that is a big deal.</p>
<p>All things considered, the JA11 has the potential to a best-seller; coming in at just $15, it becomes an impulse buy, and Fiio included a ton of features with the DAC. It has standout build quality, an easily customizable sound, and drives most IEMs with ease. If you just need a dongle DAC to use on the go, the JA11 is just about the best entry-level choice.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google Pixel 9 might use Samsung’s top-notch M14 OLED display.</li><li>Samsung' advanced M14 screens supposedly offer better brightness, longevity, and power efficiency.</li><li>The second-gen Pixel Fold is also rumored to have the M14 display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> might feature Samsung’s top display technology, if a new report is any indication.</p><p>A recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20240628000294" target="_blank">ET News</a> says Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel series will be rocking Samsung&apos;s latest M14 OLED screens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-series-screen-leak-3456027/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). These new panels are set to outdo the older ones with brighter displays, longer life, and better power efficiency.</p><p>Samsung has solidified its position as a top player in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> market and as a leading maker of OLED panels. Its M series pushes the limits of display quality. In this series, higher model numbers indicate better and more advanced display technology.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series supposedly features Samsung&apos;s M13 OLED screens, so the latest buzz means that Samsung&apos;s latest and greatest display will be used in the upcoming Google Pixel 9 and, quite unsurprisingly, the Apple iPhone 16 Pro models. If true, this move could give Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 Pro users an edge in brightness, color quality, and screen durability.</p><p>With the whole Pixel 9 lineup using M14 panels, Google seems set to keep up with Apple in display tech. On the flip side, rumors say the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus might stick with the older M12 panels to cut costs.</p><p>The M14 panel sounds like a top-notch display, but everyday users might not notice a big difference. If you usually keep your brightness settings moderate, the jump in display quality might not be that obvious.</p><p>Besides the Pixel 9 lineup, the second-generation Pixel Fold is also rumored to include the M14 display. This will mark the first time this advanced display technology appears on a smartphone.</p><p>Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">gearing up for a big hardware event on August 13</a>, where it will unveil its next-gen flagship devices. The event will highlight the latest in Google AI and Android, along with the official debut of Google&apos;s new flagship lineup.</p>
