                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I can&apos;t begin to describe my elation when Max Mustard first popped onto my Meta Quest 3 screens. The vibrant colors, quirky enemies, lovable animations, plunger gun, and jet boots all scream 90s platformer, and yet it&apos;s debuting for the first time in 2024, and in VR, no less.</p><p>A VR platformer sounds a bit strange until you think of the evolution of the platformer genre. All of the earliest examples from the genre were side-scrolling 2D games like Pitfall and Super Mario Bros. A few decades later, 3D platformers like Super Mario 64, Crash Bandicoot, and Sonic Adventure would take the concept into 3D space and revolutionize it completely.</p><p>Since there&apos;s no 4D, taking the genre into VR makes the most sense when you think about it. Now, instead of just moving your character, you yourself can look around the world, better approximate 3D depth, and even interact with the virtual world with your own two hands.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, like the Moss series, Ghost Giant, and Lucky&apos;s Tale, have already proven this formula to be successful, but it&apos;s the original PSVR&apos;s AstroBot Rescue Mission is the gold standard in VR platformers.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nECSEOy1zwM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Thankfully, Max Mustard is here to try and wrestle the title away from Astro, delivering similar precision mechanics, hidden secrets throughout each level, jump boots, and even in-game controller upgrades to the now-classic title. Adding a plunger gun to my controller was a brilliant way to enhance interaction with the world, particularly in places tough for your joystick-controller character to reach.</p><p>I had my doubts going in, but they were assuaged almost instantly with the game&apos;s Saturday morning cartoon-like intro. After all, the indie developer has only made one other game before — the ever-popular but highly gimmicky Richie&apos;s Plank Experience — yet the enthusiasm for this new title can&apos;t help but be felt in every second spent in its vibrant world.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Platformers are always a collectathon, but Max Mustard rewards you with upgrades from an item shop in exchange for collectables.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As you&apos;d expect from a platformer game, the most basic goal in Max Mustard is to get to the end of each level successfully, all while collecting as many items as possible along the way. You&apos;ll pick up different colored coins, jump on the heads of baddies, spin kick open crates to free trapped creatures, and collect power-ups that give you an edge in specific scenarios.</p>

<p>What&apos;s nice is that collecting coins isn&apos;t just for one-ups or bragging rights. Coins allow you to purchase upgrades from the item shop. One of the initial cheap upgrades includes a camera rotation option, letting you easily rotate around each level without needing to stand up or physically turn around in your seat.</p><p>The game is also perfectly playable in a seated position. I found this game to be most enjoyable when playing seated, which isn&apos;t something I&apos;d say about most VR games.</p><p>The music is whimsical, and the environments remind me quite a bit of the original Ratchet & Clank. Each world offers a good bit of variety, and you&apos;ll navigate to each level via an overworld map similar to many Super Mario games.</p>

<p>The sound design is mostly good, but I felt like there were a few times when additional sound effects would have added extra depth. I also had to repeat some of the light story sequences because I was impatient and walked off a cliff, so I&apos;d love a "skip" button in these sorts of scenarios.</p><p>All in all, this is the VR platformer I&apos;ve been waiting for and is wholly worth the $29.99 price on Meta Quest. The game is also coming to PSVR 2 and Steam VR sometime this Summer.</p>

<p>This tablet features a 10-inch full HD display, along with up to 13 hours of battery life. If you aren't a fan of lockscreen ads, you can get this tablet without—though it won't include any special Spring savings.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL5PYD69" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="29721d07-d0cd-4568-91a3-93f561450887" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10 (2023): $179.99" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10 (2023): $179.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>A smart ring can&apos;t replace a smartwatch. It can&apos;t fit all the sensors, haptics, and other components needed for apps, notifications, and calling. Aside from that, I&apos;m skeptical that a smart ring can match a watch for step count or workout data. But sleep tracking? I can&apos;t see <em>anyone</em> continuing to wear a smartwatch after trying their first smart ring. </p><p>I&apos;ve been testing the Ultrahuman Ring Air for a little over a week, and I quite like its sleep-tracking features thus far. However, my new belief isn&apos;t about one brand in particular; it could easily apply to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> that a couple of my colleagues love or the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>. What matters is the form factor. </p><p>My Ultrahuman Ring Air weighs about 3g/0.1oz, while Oura&apos;s ring measures between 4g and 6g, depending on your ring size. The upcoming Galaxy Ring apparently weighs between 2.3 and 2.9g, taking the lightweight crown. </p><p>With wrist-based wearables, even something pebble-sized like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> weighs 30g/1oz — mainly because of the strap. Switch to a proper smartwatch, and it&apos;ll weigh two or three times that, especially when you add stainless steel or titanium material. </p>

<p>During the day, I can ignore the weight and feel of a smartwatch on my skin. But as night approaches, its presence feels more oppressive, as if I&apos;m going to bed wearing my day clothes. </p><p>I know I&apos;m in the minority — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/poll-responses-wearing-smartwatches-wearables-while-sleeping">Android Central did a poll</a> in 2022 showing that 67% of readers "usually" wear a smartwatch to bed, compared to 21% who "never" do — but for me, the worst part of every smartwatch review is that I need to test their sleep tracking capabilities to judge their value for most people.</p><p>Because of that, I miss out on all the great features and health data that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> offer. My daily watch is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>, but I don&apos;t see proper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> data (my sleep energy recharge) or HRV status (stress and workout recovery levels) because I don&apos;t wear it to bed.</p><p>It&apos;s not just about comfort, either. For the best results, your smartwatch band needs to be perfectly fitted. If it&apos;s too tight, it disrupts blood flow and messes with the actual results for heart rate and blood oxygen. If it&apos;s too loose, you get erratic readings because not every pulse is picked up. Even if worn correctly at first, all it takes is your pillow or body weight shifting your smartwatch in the wrong direction, and suddenly, your data will be off for hours at a time.</p><p>Case in point, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</a> proved accurate enough for heart rate data during the day but gave me some very misleading data for blood oxygen and skin temperature during my review. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-finger-on-top-of-pillow.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air on the author's index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RUfrZmsbaB2RyHP6etwFL5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With my Ultrahuman Ring Air, it truly feels like it blends into my skin. My usual issues with tactile hypersensitivity—or whatever the official psychological term is—don&apos;t apply anymore.</p><p>Now, when I wake up, I can see my sleep duration, time in each sleep zone, average and resting heart rate, skin temperature, heart rate variability, heart rate drop time, blood oxygen average, restlessness, and most of the other core data I need. The exception is atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection, which I don&apos;t think any smart ring brand offers yet. </p><p>Of course, you can still get inaccurate readings if you choose a smart ring that&apos;s too tight or loose. But since you can buy them in most ring sizes, that&apos;s rarely an issue. </p><p>Once you&apos;ve got a smart ring that&apos;s properly fitted, even if it presses hard against your pillow or mattress while you sleep, it still adheres to your skin along most of your finger — much better than a smartwatch would. The exception is during workouts, when your fingers naturally swell from the increased blood flow, which seems to mess with your heart rate results.  </p><p>Now that I&apos;m wearing a smart ring, I find it much harder to justify going to bed late or having a can of High Noon, knowing that little chunk of metal will warn me about my poor sleep recharge or decreased HRV the next day. I hope it&apos;ll help me establish better habits over the long run.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re already happy with your smartwatch, then you can save yourself the $300 cost of a typical smart ring and enjoy the sleep-tracking features. I&apos;m happy for you!</p><p>For those in the minority, like myself, who just can&apos;t stand the weight, the sweat and grime build-up, the swelling of their wrists, and the overall awareness of something pressing hard into their skin all night, a smart ring is your solution. You&apos;ll get the health and energy data you&apos;ve been missing without any discomfort. </p><p>The downside to smart rings is what I said at the beginning: They&apos;re not meant to replace your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> for app smarts, nor your fitness watch for metrics and GPS. But if you&apos;re the kind of techie who can afford to add smart rings to your category of devices, then I highly recommend it. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors indicate that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could be the world's first foldable phone with a titanium frame, potentially differentiating it significantly from its predecessors.</li><li>While the switch to titanium might enhance durability, it could also result in a higher price point, though nothing is confirmed yet.</li><li>Speculation suggests that both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 could launch in July.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung decided to go with a titanium frame for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, and now it looks like the company is thinking of using the same material for its next folding phone.</p><p>As per leaker @Tech_Reve on X (formerly Twitter), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is rumored to ditch the aluminum frame of the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and opt for a titanium one instead (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-titanium-frame-rumor/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). If this turns out to be true, Samsung&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> would be the first in the world to boast a titanium frame.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Z Fold 6 equipped with titanium.<a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1771412393761141025">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This backs up an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1760285931813404845" target="_blank">earlier rumor</a> hinting at Samsung&apos;s move to embrace a titanium frame for its upcoming book-style foldable. It&apos;s a shift we&apos;ve already witnessed with Apple&apos;s iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, using titanium in a phone does usually bump up the cost.</p><p>Since Samsung has already made the switch with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, it seems likely the company will do the same with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, we&apos;re crossing our fingers that this change won&apos;t come with a price increase.</p><p>Right now, it&apos;s unclear whether Samsung will stick with the same Grade 2 titanium frame seen on the Galaxy S24 Ultra or opt for a higher-grade version.</p><p>We&apos;ve already caught a glimpse of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-renders-leak">leaked renders showing what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 might look like</a>, but they didn&apos;t exactly get us excited. There&apos;s also talk that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-improved-ultra-thin-glass-and-thinner-design">might come with a better UTG (Ultra Thin Glass) screen</a> for a smoother touch experience and stronger durability.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest that both the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> are set to make their debut in July, arriving a year after their predecessors. There&apos;s also a rumor floating around about the possibility of a more affordable version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-fe-may-drop-this-key-feature-to-bring-the-price-down">potentially dubbed the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE</a>.</p><p>It totally makes sense for Samsung to go all out in distinguishing the cheaper alternative from the premium Galaxy Z Fold 6. Similar to its predecessor, the latter will come with S-Pen support, a feature that might be absent in the FE variant. The potential addition of a titanium frame will further set it apart from the cheaper model.</p>

<p>The creation of the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) opened the door to better compatibility when it comes to using a stylus on a Chromebook. Now that USI has been around for a while, there are plenty of great Chromebooks available that support the standard. Some even come with a stylus in tow.</p><p>Getting the best Chromebook with a stylus included makes it so you don&apos;t have to search for one after the fact, and you have everything you need out of the box. If you&apos;re confused about choosing one, here are all the best ones based on factors like your budget, battery life, or simply the best one all around!</p>

<p>What do you get when you pair reliable hardware with excellent internals and an included stylus? The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> is the answer, which was revamped in 2022, complete with Intel&apos;s 12th Gen chipsets and Iris Xe graphics. With the Spin 714, Acer actually remedied a few of the complaints we&apos;ve had with some of the best Chromebooks. Although the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)</a> is now out, the newer iteration does not come with a stylus anymore. Therefore, the 2022 variant continues to be the best Chromebook that comes with a stylus.</p><p>Not only is Intel&apos;s Core i5 chipset paired with 8GB of RAM more than enough power to handle practically everything. But it also sports a wonderful display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, along with plenty of ports, including multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/intel-thunderbolt-4-official-8k-display">Thunderbolt 4</a> ports. The star of the show with the Spin 714 is the garaged USI stylus that is found at the edge of the bottom casing. This makes it easy to grab the stylus when you want to flip over into tablet mode or if you need to sign a document quickly.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, having a garaged stylus removes the need to worry about losing your Chromebook stylus. While it&apos;s not exactly the most comfortable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI stylus</a> we&apos;ve used, we&apos;re big fans of the convenience provided by being housed right in the chassis. Now, you can just download your favorite note-taking apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chrome-os-102-release">Google Cursive</a> or Nebo, take the stylus out of the slot, and start hand-writing your notes from anywhere without trying to find exactly where you put your stylus.</p>

<p>While a few companies have tried to release ChromeOS tablets, none really caught on in the same way that the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet</a> did. This was really the ultimate tablet for media consumption, especially if you just wanted to unwind for the day on the couch. Considering its popularity, we assumed it was only a matter of time before Lenovo released a successor.</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what Lenovo did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">IdeaPad Chromebook Duet 3</a>. Despite changing the naming scheme to fall in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review">Chromebook Duet 5</a>, the Duet 3 solved quite some of the issues we had with the original Duet, with a few caveats. Not only is this one of the first Chromebooks to be released with USI 2.0 compatibility, but it&apos;s also the only current Chromebook to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-usi-2-stylus">limited to USI 2.0 stylus pens</a>. This means that if owned one of the best stylus for Chromebooks, then you&apos;ll need to adjust accordingly.</p><p>While Lenovo includes the detachable keyboard and kickstand case in the box, you might be disappointed if you grab the model with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. That&apos;s because Lenovo is <em>only</em> including its new USI 2.0 Stylus Pen with the model using 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p>It&apos;s definitely a bit frustrating, but you can also grab Lenovo&apos;s USI 2.0 Stylus Pen separately if you just want to go with the base model. At the end of the day, the Chromebook Duet 3 remains one of our favorite Chromebooks, and its smaller form factor is a delight to carry around.</p>

The base configuration comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, paired with Arm Mali-G72 MP3 graphics.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 is a 2-in-1 convertible, allowing you to flip back the screen to either take notes or just prop it up to watch a movie or just pop the keyboard off to use it as a tablet. The case itself has a stand built into the back, so you can prop up the Chromebook in laptop mode as well as tablet mode.</p><p>Sadly, there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sd-cards-your-chromebook">microSD card</a> slot, so you can&apos;t add more storage if you need to. While we wish ASUS used a 16:10 QHD screen, the Chromebook Detachable CM3&apos;s display still looks pretty darn great.</p>

If you don&apos;t believe me, all you need to do is take one look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-elite-dragonfly-chromebook-review">HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook</a>. You would be hard-pressed to find a Chromebook that can rival what the Dragonfly has to offer.</p><p>In addition to the 13.5-inch display with its 3:2 aspect ratio, you&apos;ll enjoy 12th Gen Intel chips, configurable with up to 32GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are dual Thunderbolt 4 ports onboard, along with a full-size HDMI and even a microSD card slot. However, the real star of the show is the haptic trackpad, giving Chromebooks a taste of why there are so many fans of the trackpad found on the best MacBooks. </p><p>As for stylus support, you don&apos;t have to worry about compatibility, as HP includes its USI Digital Pen in the box with the Dragonfly. This attaches magnetically to the side of the bottom frame, which helps you keep track of it, but it also recharges the stylus whenever it&apos;s attached. </p><p>While this is arguably one of the best Chromebooks ever made, its excellence is only superseded by its exorbitant price tag. This is definitely not the cheapest Chromebook on the market, but in our opinion, it&apos;s worth every penny as long as you have the money to spend.</p>

<p>To be quite honest, whenever a new Chromebook comes across our desk, it&apos;s definitely a bit odd to find the ones that don&apos;t include stylus support. However, not every Chromebook includes a stylus in the box.</p><p>Because there aren&apos;t very many options if you want a Chromebook that includes a stylus, it makes the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (2022) even more appealing. Not only does it offer incredible performance, but the stylus is also always with you, removing the need to empty your bag just to find it. Plus, you&apos;re getting one of the best processors that Intel has to offer at a fraction of the price compared to premium options.</p><p>If you want a true ChromeOS tablet that includes a stylus, just make sure you grab the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Lenovo includes its USI 2.0 stylus pen in the box, along with the detachable keyboard and magnetic kickstand. The Duet 3 is lightweight, portable, and a fantastic choice for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook-students">taking notes in class</a> or just playing some solitaire.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Nord CE4 is expected to debut on April 1, potentially as a rebranded version of the Ace 3V from China.</li><li>Notable differences between the Nord CE4 and Ace 3V include the Nord CE4's 100W charging capability, making it the fastest-charging Nord phone yet.</li><li>The display of the Nord CE4 will feature an AMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus continues to drip-feed bits of information about the upcoming Nord CE4, and the latest word from the company sheds light on how fast it charges and its display refresh rate.</p><p>We&apos;ve already known that the OnePlus Nord CE4 is slated for an April 1 debut. Rumor has it that it&apos;s likely going to be a revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3v-goes-official-in-china">Ace 3V that recently launched in China</a>.</p><p>However, there might be a couple of tweaks that set them apart. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/nord-ce4-5g" target="_blank">OnePlus India</a>, the Nord CE 4 will rock 100W charging, claiming the title of the speediest-charging model yet among our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">favorite OnePlus phones</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_ce4_display_specs-news-62116.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the display, OnePlus has also revealed additional details. The upcoming smartphone is locked in to sport an AMOLED screen with an FHD+ resolution and a buttery smooth 120Hz screen refresh rate.</p><p>If this pans out, the Nord CE4 looks like it&apos;s going to hit that sweet spot in the midrange game. We&apos;re still in the dark about the exact screen size, but it&apos;ll probably hover around the 6.7-inch ballpark, considering the previous model.</p><p>On paper, it&apos;s looking pretty solid. However, it&apos;s a step down from the 1.5K resolution we saw on the Ace 3V.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord series aims to offer bang for your buck, especially the Nord CE devices, which take affordability even further compared to the mainline Nord phones. While the price of the Nord CE4 remains a mystery, it&apos;s definitely showing off some impressive specs on paper.</p><p>The company has been having a blast building up the hype for the big reveal, dropping hints here and there about what to expect from the device. At this stage, we&apos;re pretty clued in about what this midranger is packing. OnePlus has already confirmed that the next Nord CE installment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-to-launch-on-april-1-2024">will rock the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC under the hood</a>.</p><p>The upcoming phone might hit the shelves with an 8GB LPDDR4x RAM and 256GB storage option, but there&apos;s a chance we&apos;ll see more choices when it officially drops.</p><p>However, it&apos;s worth noting that the internal specs take a slight dip compared to the Ace 3V in China, which boasts the newer Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chip, starting with a base configuration of 12GB LPDDR5x RAM.</p>

<ul><li>Google Wallet previously allowed users to make contactless payments in small amounts without unlocking their device, though the exact terms varied by region.</li><li>Last month, Google added a disclaimer to a related support article that warned users that their payment wouldn't go through unless they had recently unlocked their device.</li><li>Now, this change is rolling out in Europe, and users took to social media to share their frustration with this change. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a change to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> that will make using contactless payments for small transactions more secure but also more frustrating. Google Wallet works in different ways based on a user&apos;s region, and in Europe, it previously allowed users to pay in small amounts without unlocking their devices. The threshold varied by country, and in some places like the U.S., all transactions required a device unlock. Now, Google is making device unlocks a requirement for all users in all reasons, and not everyone is happy about the change. </p><p>The company updated a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519#zippy=%2Cpayment-limits-on-a-locked-device" target="_blank">support document</a> last month related to tap-to-pay transactions, previewing the shift in Google Wallet behavior (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/22/google-wallet-unlock/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). </p><p>"Coming soon, your credit and debit card won&apos;t be charged for retail payments unless you&apos;ve recently used a verification method, like your fingerprint or PIN," the notice reads. "Some users may already need to verify to make a payment. If you’re asked to verify it’s you, complete verification steps on your device to make a payment."</p><p>U.S. users won&apos;t notice a change because device unlocks were already necessary for all transactions other than those using express transit. However, users in other countries could make transactions under a given threshold without unlocking in Google Wallet. For example, people in Canada could make payments under $100 CAD without unlocking their devices. In the U.K., that limit is around £45 GBP.</p><p>However, people in regions where device unlocks were not always required are finding they now need to authenticate each contactless payment in Google Wallet, no matter the transaction size. The only exception is if a user has recently used a verification method. So, if you authenticated Google Wallet a minute ago and haven&apos;t locked your device, you won&apos;t need to unlock it again. </p><p>Though this change makes Google Wallet objectively more secure, not everyone is happy about it. A few users on Reddit criticized the shift, and others called it a non-issue. One thing many seem to agree on is that Google should have left the choice up to the end user whether to require device unlocks for every transaction. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s choice to require verification for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">Google Wallet payments</a> of all denominations has brought up an age-old debate in cybersecurity: do you want convenience or security? Users on social media disagree, but in this case, Google has made the decision for them. </p>

<ul><li>With the second Android 15 Developer Preview, users can choose between a pinned or hidden taskbar on large-screened Pixel devices. </li><li>The option marks the return of the Android 12L-style taskbar, which was present at the bottom of the screen all the time. </li><li>Now, Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users can employ a persistent taskbar for multitasking or a hidden taskbar for extra screen real estate. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google sent out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second Android 15 Developer Preview</a> this past week, and it includes a change that&apos;ll benefit owners of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a> or Pixel Tablet.</p><p>Now that the company makes a few big-screened devices, Google has been swiftly optimizing Android for larger displays. Part of that effort included adding the taskbar as a way to quickly launch apps and multitask from anywhere in Android, and starting with Android 15 DP2, users have the choice of having a pinned or floating taskbar. </p><p>Since it was introduced a few years ago, the taskbar has evolved quite a bit. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12l-how-google-fixes-android-foldables-and-large-screens">Android 12L</a>, it was a permanent fixture at the bottom of large Android devices. It remained on the screen while users opened up other apps, thus cutting into the total screen space available. That&apos;s why Google reversed course in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a>, transitioning the taskbar into a floating oval that could be shown or hidden as needed. However, there was never a way to choose between these taskbar variants. </p><p>That is, until now. Android expert Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-taskbar-pinning-3427938/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first noticed the option to choose between taskbar styles in Android 15 DP2. After tapping and holding on an open space in the taskbar, a new <strong>Always show taskbar </strong>toggle will appear. There&apos;s a toggle beside it, and tapping the toggle will transition the windowed taskbar into the pinned taskbar.</p><p>While the Android 15 DP2 version of the floating taskbar is visually updated with the new Android design language, it&apos;s more or less functionally identical to the old version. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 15 DP2 finally adds the "taskbar pinning" feature I first spotted backed in Android 14 Beta 3!This feature lets Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet users revert back to the old, persistent taskbar style introduced in Android 12L.More details 👇https://t.co/Upo1d7tQ5z<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1771225394185699757">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>There are clear benefits to going with each taskbar version. The pinned taskbar option makes it easier to call up new apps, create multitasking views, and switch between active apps. On the other hand, the floating taskbar gives you more screen space to fill up with Android apps. The good thing about the Android 15 DP2 change is that Pixel Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> users now have the option of choosing the taskbar version they prefer best.</p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) will be launching in Mint color next to Pink and Black colorways.</li><li>It will likely opt for the Exynos 1280 for the first time, switching away from the Qualcomm chipset.</li><li>The tablet has been spotted in BIS certification, indicating two variants in the pipeline.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is the next mid-range tablet that will likely launch soon, and while we have already seen early renders of the device, a new leak spills some more information on the upcoming tablet.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite was first introduced in 2020, and its next iteration launched in 2022. Two years later, its successor may see the light of day, and a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-mint-colour-images/">91mobiles</a> reveals that it will sport a new Mint color for the first time. </p><p>91mobiles indicates that these images were spotted in some official listings showcasing the device in full, including its features and specs. The upcoming tablet will likely have the same design as its predecessor, and alongside the new Mint color, it will also have pink and black colorways during the launch. The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) was seen in Pink in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-leak">leaked renders</a> early this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.36%;"><img id="Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-render-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wsz292gmpAdy25ceMPiqgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1146" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the design, the rest of the specs are likely pretty similar to those of its predecessor. It includes a 10.4-inch screen with 2000 x 1200 resolution accompanied by sizable bezels. The optics setup will again likely comprise a single 8MP sensor on the rear and a 5MP selfie shooter on the front. The rear camera would presumably support 1080p video recording.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the predecessor is its battery capacity, and the Tab S6 Lite (2024) is also expected to sport a massive 7,040mAh battery with 14-hour video playback. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range tablet</a> also supports the S-Pen, which attaches to the right pane of the device and matches the corresponding color of the tablet.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting change from the previous iteration is the chipset powering the tablet. It is expected to ship with an Exynos 1280 SoC, which powers some Galaxy phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a>. The same chipset was mentioned in the previous leak, which showcased the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) renders. </p>

<p>For storage, the upcoming Galaxy Tab S6 would feature at least 4GB of RAM aided by either 64GB or 128GB of onboard storage, and microSD support is expected for additional storage. 91mobiles further notes that the device will ship One UI 6.1 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>) out of the box. Additional highlights of the device include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and AKG-powered speakers.</p><p>The device recently went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-bis-india-launch/">BIS certification</a> bearing <strong>SM-P620</strong> and <strong>SM-P625</strong> model numbers, which indicate that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) would be available in Wi-Fi and LTE variants. It also seems to have appeared in the U.S. FCC and Denmark&apos;s UL database — all pointing out to an imminent launch starting with India.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a phone that tooks high-quality photos and videos; you prefer a smartphone with several Android OS updates; you like the Pixel design language, both in UI and in physical aesthetic.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you want your phone to come with a charger out of the box; </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 is a great small phone with the beautiful aesthetics and performance that have become associated with the Pixel series. Its 6.2-inch AMOLED display doesn&apos;t hinder it from being a great phone for one-hand users, as Google designed it to be about 5.1mm shorter and 2.4mm narrower than the last-generation Pixel 7. The screen offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, and while the Google Tensor G3 chipset isn&apos;t the fastest processor out there, it still features smooth performance with a beautiful, user-friendly UI design.</p><p>This configuration comes with 128GB of storage, though you can also upgrade to 256GB. It also offers three powerful cameras, including both rear- and front-facing  wide-angle lenses, and seven years of Android OS updates—the most you can get with an Android phone.</p>
