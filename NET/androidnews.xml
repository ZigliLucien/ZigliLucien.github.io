<p>A student needs a phone that&apos;s both reasonably affordable and reliable so it can keep working for a few years without any major issues. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> fits the bill for many with a price tag on the low side of $500 with seven years of software updates coming from Google.</p><p>While the main line Pixel series has the most features, the Pixel a-series phones are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range smartphones</a> that money can buy. This is thanks to Google&apos;s excellent camera software which makes the Pixel 8A a great phone for photographers that want something that can capture a vibrant image with automatic settings. This year&apos;s model also is available with either 128GB or 256GB of storage, so you have plenty of room to save your photos.</p><p>The Pixel 8a is powered by the same Tensor G3 SoC as the main Pixel 8 phones. This isn&apos;t the most powerful smartphone chip available, but it still does a good job keeping up with Android 14 with 8GB of RAM. It&apos;s 6.1-inch OLED display is on the smaller side which works with its rounded corners making this a good options for one-handed use. Last but not least, it comes in four colors with the Aloe and Bay colors looking vibrant and colorful, plus the more serious porcelain and obsidian colors.</p>

<p>For a student, the Galaxy A35 is a strong choice that keeps its price reasonably low while keeping many of the most important features. The phone is powered by an Exynos 1380 SoC which is plenty fast for most apps and even some gaming, but can also sip power making the large 5000mAh last all day. The display is large with a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED panel with up to 1000nits of brightness so you can see your screen clearly while waiting on the bus. The phone comes with 128GB of storage, but microSD expansion means you can add space if you need it.</p><p>While it lacks wireless charging, this phone’s 5000mAh battery can be charged relatively quickly at up to 25W. You should be able to easily make it to the end of the day, so you’re not stuck looking for an open outlet in a crowded lecture hall. The camera system is solid with a 50MP main camera, a 5MP macro camera, and an 8MP ultrawide camera. The selfie camera is also decent with a 13MP sensor. Make no mistake, a cheap Pixel, like the Pixel 8a, will turn in better-looking results, but the A35’s camera system is no slouch.</p><p>As for network support, this phone is available through AT&T and T-Mobile with some prepaid Verizon carriers like Total and Visible also offering it. The unlocked version of this phone doesn’t list band n71 support, however, the version sold by T-Mobile does, so make sure you’re getting a version that works with your carrier of choice. Especially if you think you might switch to save with a low-cost prepaid carrier. It’s also worth noting that this phone ships with Android 14 and is set to get four Android generation updates and five years of security updates, so it should last the duration of a four-year degree, even if it takes five years.</p>

<p>With a large 5,000mAh battery and relatively low power hardware, the Samsung Galaxy A25 is should easily make it to the end of the day on a charge. It also charges quickly at up to 25W. While the phone isn’t terribly powerful, you still get a large 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display running at up to 120Hz. The AMOLED tech in the screen means you get rich colors with good contrast. There’s a small notch at the top of the screen allowing for the selfie camera, which is a bit old school, but looks decently nice.</p><p>Speaking of cameras, this phone features a three-camera array on the back with a 50MP main shooter, 8MP ultra wide camera, and 2MP macro camera for closeups. That main camera won’t keep up with the likes of the Pixel 8a, but given a decent amount of light, can still deliver some solid images. If you’re just looking for something good enough for Instagram, it’s a fine choice. Mid-band and low-band 5G is supported on the U.S. model with Wi-Fi 5 picking up the slack.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> is an affordable phone that looks and feels high-end thanks to a design that borrows a lot from the pricier OnePlus 12, with a powerful SoC from last year&apos;s flagships. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC inside this phone is plenty for the latest Android app including 3D games. The phone packs in 8GB of RAM in the cheapest model to keep it running smoothly on Android 14. Speaking of Android, this phone is set to receive three OS updates along with four years of security updates. That&apos;s not as much as a flagship phone, but still impressive for a phone at this price.</p><p>The primary 50MP camera looks great in both well-lit and lowlight situations. The Pixel 8a is still on top overall, but for most people, both phones are excellent choices for the cameras. The OnePlus 12R is designed to work well with carriers in the U.S. with 5G support, so you can bring it to whichever carrier you want. Last but not least, this phone has a long-lasting 5500mAh battery that supports charging speeds up to 100W.</p>

<p>OnePlus not only manages to make waves with its high-end phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, but also with its cheaper devices like the OnePlus Nord N30. This phone has a nice look and feel with two large camera lenses on the back, and an expansive 6.72-inch LCD panel on the front. There’s a bit more bezel on the bottom of the phone giving it a bit of a chin, but overall looks modern and sleek.</p><p>This phone has been updated to Android 14, so you can download it straight away after setting up your phone. It’s all powered by the competent Snapdragon 695 CPU and Adreno 619 GPU, which our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 review</a> found was plenty for day-to-day tasks with enough horsepower for some gaming with low details. The main 108MP camera does most of the heavy lifting with a depth sensor and 2MP macro camera sharing the bottom lens.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G</a> has been one of the best cheap phones you can get for a few generations now, and this 2024 model is one of the best yet with impressive hardware and a striking new look. The vegan leather finish feels nice in the hand which is great if you plan on taking notes with the included stylus. Using the display feels nice and snappy with a 120Hz OLED panel capable of up to 1200 nits with a quick Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 with 8GB of RAM behind it. It even has a headphone jack and microSD card slot for storage expansion.</p><p>This phone has a large 5000mAh battery, which is fairly common for budget-oriented phones, but what’s less common is the 30W wired charging support and 15W wireless charging. When it comes to the camera, the main 50MP sensor and 13MP ultra-wide camera produce some nice images, though they aren’t the best you’ll find at this price. Still, with how much this phone gets right in other areas, it’s easy to forgive.</p><p>One thing Motorola gets very right is carrier support with full 5G band support for AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. That means you can shop for the best value phone carrier so you don’t waste money on a bunch of carrier features you don’t really need. Plus, most campuses have Wi-Fi anywhere you might find a student, so you may not even need that much data. If you do, however, 5G support is strong and should give you strong speed on any carrier.</p>

<p>Android phone can be great for students with plenty of powerful for multitasking, good integration with ChromeOS and Windows laptops, and unique designs to that can fit anyone&apos;s needs. Any of the Android phones on this list will serve a student well for school, but among all of them, we have to give our top recommendation to the Google Pixel 8a.</p><p>Google&apos;s attempt at making a mid-range Pixel device turned out to be a smashing success. The Google Pixel 8a might have a smaller battery and slightly worse display compared to its more expensive siblings, but the incredible cameras, super clean software, IP67 rating, and Google&apos;s robust Tensor G3 chipset make this a phone that&apos;s genuinely enjoyable to use day in and day out.</p><p>Among all of that, though, another big reason the Pixel 8a stands out is because of its post-purchase support. Since this is a phone made by Google itself, it&apos;s set to get updates early with seven years of OS updates promised by Google. That means you&apos;ll be able to keep using this phone for years before you need to spend on a new one.</p>
<h2 id="what-accessories-do-students-need-2">What accessories do students need?</h2>
<p>Whether you&apos;re starting college or are on the last stretch at high school, you&apos;ll want a few accessories to make the most of your smartphone. First of all, a strong case will help you phone survive a few more bumps and drops. You can get a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-cases">great cases for the Pixel 8a</a> that offer extra protection if it falls down a few stairs at a new dorm, or falls out of a pocket while rushing to class.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable power bank</a> can also be useful to bring with you whether you forgot to plug your phone in the night before, or find that your laptop drained its battery in your backpack. With so much tech supporting USB-C, having a power bank can keep you going till the end of class without needing to run a charging cable across the aisle in a lecture hall.</p><p>Picking up some wireless earbuds can also be great for getting work done outside of your dorm room. If you&apos;re easily distracted by noise and talking, picking up some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">earbuds</a> to use with your phone and laptop can help you get some peace and quiet. They can also help when you need to attend an online lecture or meeting and just can&apos;t find a quiet place to be. This can be especially difficult when you need to complete a task by 11:59pm on a Friday and you&apos;ve been responsible enough to get started by 11:00.</p>

<ul><li>The VR Games Showcase showed off 17 upcoming games, and games like Alien Rogue Incursion, Metal: Hellsinger VR, and Behemoth now have a release date.</li><li>Meta Quest update v69 came out this week, debuting three big features including Meta AI and a new HDMI Link app.</li><li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas VR has officially been put on hold indefinitely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>No other gaming system is quite like the Meta Quest, and part of that is the sheer number of feature additions and new updates on the platform every month. This week saw the release of Meta Quest update v69, which brings a big new multitasking feature to the system.</p><p>Meta calls it Seamless Multitasking and it means users can now open any 2D app while they&apos;re playing a VR game. For example, lets say you get stuck in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard&apos;s Wrath 2</a> and can&apos;t figure out a puzzle. Now, you can open the YouTube app <em>while you&apos;re still playing the game</em> and watch how-to videos in a floating window.</p><p>To do it yourself, press the Oculus/Meta button on the right controller, grab that little white line underneath an app&apos;s floating window, and drag it anywhere you want. This opens a multitude of possibilities that even the Apple Vision Pro doesn&apos;t allow, making the Quest a powerful multitasking beast. Here&apos;s the feature in action:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I feel I didn't do a great job showing it off so here is a more practical example of the "Seamless Multitasking" Experimental Feature in Meta Quest/Horizon OS v69. https://t.co/MLAI7WdE41 pic.twitter.com/iL2CQa6LQs<a href="https://twitter.com/Lunayian/status/1821753857925317108">August 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Next, Meta upgraded its voice commands and replaced them with Meta AI, the same technology that allows your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">see the real world</a> and understand what&apos;s in front of you. Meta AI for Quest lets you do system level commands like the previous voice command system — launching apps, sending messages, taking screenshots or video — as well as a bunch of new vision-related things.</p><p>Meta AI with vision allows Meta AI to use the Quest&apos;s cameras to ask it questions, or you can just ask the assistant anything you&apos;d like, similar to other LLM&apos;s like Google Gemini or ChatGPT. Meta has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/learn-more-meta-ai-meta-quest/">getting started post</a> that&apos;ll help you get Meta AI set up.</p>
<p>And lastly, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/hdmi-link-launch/">showed off</a> a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7452106424824357/">HDMI Link app</a> which lets you plug in any device to your headset so you can see that device on larger virtual windows. The obvious reason to use this would be to work on a plane, as you can get a giant monitor in front of your face instead of cramping your neck by looking down at your laptop.</p><p>The caveat right now is that it only works with USB Capture cards, so it&apos;s not quite as plug-and-play as we&apos;d hoped. Meta says it&apos;s working on wider compatibility, so the HDMI Link app is only available in App Lab for now.</p>

<p>The first VR Games Showcase aired on August 15 and it brought 17 game announcements along for the ride. The entire 30-minute show can be watched in the video above, including hits like Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded first gameplay, Arizona Sunshine Remake, Grim and Silent North by the Ghosts of Tabor studio, PSVR favorite Fracked coming to Meta Quest, and more. There&apos;s even brand new VR versions of popular non-VR games like Flatout and Trombone Champ.</p><p>I also got the chance to play Vendetta Forever ahead of the show and found it to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vendetta-forever-superhot-vr-spiritual-successor">SUPERHOT VR spiritual successor</a> I&apos;ve been waiting 8 years for.</p><p>Beyond the showcase, we also got release dates for several big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LFnyWBH79s">Metal: Hellsinger VR</a> is making its debut on Quest on September 26, Skydance&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/behemoth-hands-on">Behemoth</a> is coming to Quest on November 14, and rounding out the end of the year is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY2YqgDUvFk">Alien Rogue Incursion</a> on December 19.</p>

<p>A single-player mode for upcoming mixed reality shooter Spatial Ops was also announced, with a new trailer giving us a first look at the campaign gameplay. Spatial Ops was thought to be a local multiplayer-only title initially, so it&apos;s exciting to see a mixed reality game like this getting a mode that&apos;s playable without a bunch of other Quest users in the same room.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5503065683135424/">preorder Spatial Ops now</a> and, while you&apos;re waiting for the final release, give the beta a shot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/12180/spatial-ops">on Sidequest</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to the big disappointment of the week. Grand Theft Auto San Andreas VR has been "put on hold indefinitely," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-san-andreas-vr-delayed-indefinitely-as-meta-focuses-on-other-projects">IGN</a>. GTA San Andreas VR was infamously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-coming-oculus-quest-2">announced three years ago</a> as coming to the Oculus Quest 2 but we never heard any updates from Meta since then.</p><p>Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">just closed</a> a beloved first-party Oculus Studios developer last week so it&apos;s not much of a surprise to see them put other projects on hold, especially one that was rumored to have faced a lot of turmoil during its years of development. This, of course, doesn&apos;t mean <em>canceled</em> but it&apos;s not likely we&apos;ll see any sort of VR GTA game any time soon.</p>

For one, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV4NH5T9" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has cut 19% off the unlocked Samsung Galaxy A35 5G</strong></a>, marking a historic $75 in savings for a great mid-level phone. This unlocked smartphone comes with 128GB of storage, a bright, 6.6-inch display and front-facing and rear cameras boasting 13MP and 50MP, respectively. Plus, this A Series Galaxy phone comes with 6GB of RAM, an Exynos 1380 processor, and up to 25W charging speeds.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is a quality phone that won't break the bank, and especially with an extra 19% off the purchase price at Amazon. Users like this phone's bright, beautiful 6.6-inch screen, along with its high-performance cameras, and its generally smooth performance compared to competitors at this price point.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you&apos;ve liked other Samsung Galaxy phones you&apos;ve used and are on somewhat of a budget; a phone having water and dust resistance is a priority to you; you want something that&apos;s going to include multiple years of updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you have a little more money to spend and would rather upgrade to Samsung&apos;s S series; you prefer something with more than 6GB of RAM; you&apos;re looking for a phone with a little more adventurous of a design.</p><p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> categories are typically reserved for Samsung&apos;s premium-level S lineup, the A Series still offers great performance at a price point that most can manage a little more easily. From the A35&apos;s 50MP main camera to its good-looking and bright 6.6-inch screen, this is definitely a mid-level, budget-friendly phone that still competes pretty well with some of its higher-priced competitors. This phone also features 128GB of storage, an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, and the inclusion of Samsung Knox.</p><p>It also comes with four years of Android updates and five years of security patches, so you&apos;ll be able to use the A35 for a while without it becoming too obsolete. Add in its 25W charging and 5,000mAh battery, and you&apos;ve got a pretty solid, somewhat future-proofed phone.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Differences between the Samsung Galaxy A35 and the A55</a> include a little more RAM and a slightly better processor in the higher-end model, and slightly better rear cameras. However, most casual users may not even notice a performance boost in the 55 model, and the extra $75 off the A35 make it a pretty great deal.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 finally comes in a second 45mm size, and we can't thank Google enough for it! Apart from the two sizes though, there's not a lot that's different on the hardware front compared to the Watch 2. This wouldn't have been an issue had Google priced the Watch 3 lower, but it didn't and we can see how many might not be happy with that. </p></p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 falls in the same trap of looking the same as its predecessor, just like the Pixel Watch 3. Unlike the latter though, Samsung has made a bunch of improvements under the hood that make the usage experience and health tracking much better. It doesn't hurt that it's also more affordable. </p></p>

<p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 is finally official, along with the rest of the Pixel phones and new earbuds. Google claims the Watch 3 has been "designed for performance inside and out," with a big emphasis on new activity monitoring features and deeper integration with Nest devices. One thing that everyone will care about is that it finally comes in two sizes, so you can pick the one that suits your wrist the best. It&apos;s still a premium device, make no mistake about that, and the prices certainly reflect that. </p><p>Samsung has been making pretty successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch" target="_blank">WearOS watches</a> for a while, and its latest Galaxy Watch 7 brings tangible improvements to health and fitness tracking. It&apos;s also quite a bit cheaper, making it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> to buy. While the Pixel Watch 2 is also on that list, is the Watch 7 the better choice when compared to the latest Watch 3? Keep reading, and the answer should be clear soon enough. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4nc4wTtM23BiRFiJvKrPsb" name="google-pixel-watch-3-with-pixel-buds-pro-2.jpg" alt="Green Pixel Watch 3 with Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nc4wTtM23BiRFiJvKrPsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> looks nearly the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, except that it now comes in a 41mm and 45mm dial sizes. The watch housing is made from 100% recycled aluminum, and features a single side button and a haptic crown like before. The 42mm model has a 1.2-inch AMOLED display while the larger one has a 1.4-inch display.  The bezels are now slimmer, giving you 10% more screen on the smaller one, and 40% more on the large model. The 45mm model can actually show you more menus and information at a time, compared to the 41mm model. This is a smart move as it gives you one more incentive to trade-up to the larger size. </p><p>The Actua displays on the Pixel Watch 3 now come with up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness, and a variable refreh rate of 1Hz to 60Hz. There&apos;s also 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for scratch protection. You get two sizes of the watch band in the box. Since Google is using the same mechanism for the watch bands, most of the older bands going back to the first Pixel Watch will be compatible with the 41mm variant of the Watch 3. The Active Band is bundled with the watch, but you can get other finishes separately. Matte Black and Polished Silver are common colors across sizes, while the 41mm also comes in a Champagne Gold and the 45mm in Matte Hazel.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> also comes in two sizes, a 40mm model with a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display and a 44mm with a 1.5-inch display. The display sizes are slightly larger than the Pixel Watch 3, as are the resolutions. Samsung uses Sapphire Crystal for scratch protection which has proven to be very effective so far. </p><p>The displays are, in fact, pretty much identical to what was used on the Watch 6, down the peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits. We found the screen to be crisp, punchy, and highly legible under sunlight. Unlike the larger variant of the Pixel Watch, the 44mm Galaxy Watch 7 will display the same amount of information or elements as the 40mm one, only bigger. </p><p>Both sizes of the Galaxy Watch 7 come with a sports band that matches the color of the watch&apos;s casing. Green is the default across sizes, but the 40mm comes in Cream while the 44mm comes in Silver. You can unlock plenty more color options and band combinations if you buy it via Samsung&apos;s online store. </p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 follows the same premium pricing as the outgoing model. The 41mm variant costs $349 for Wi-Fi only and $449 for LTE. Meanwhile, the new 45mm model is priced at $399, and the LTE variant costs $499. Samsung has taken a more affordable approach, as the 40mm model costs $299.99 and $349.99 (LTE), while the 44mm variant is $329.99 and $379.99 (LTE). </p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 is powered by the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Qualcomm W5 Gen 1</a> processor and the Cortex M33 co-processor. It runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and has 32GB of storage and 2GB of memory. The watch is also waterproof up to 5ATM and carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. All the sensors are similar to the Pixel Watch 2 and allow you to track health readings like SpO2 monitoring and taking an ECG. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-health-sensor-curvature.jpg" alt="The new health sensor curvature on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQgQLnZaJLZph7TTjf2yRe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3802" height="2139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has made some big upgrades on the inside of the Galaxy Watch 7. It now uses a new Exynos W1000 SoC, which is a more power-efficient chip than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6</a>. It too, has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Both sizes of the Galaxy Watch 7 are lighter than the Pixel Watch. The other big change is in Samsung&apos;s BioActive Sensor, which required a redesign of the glass underneath, resulting in a deeper dome shape. The Watch 7 also has 5ATM water resistance and an IP68 rating, but also gets a MIL-STD-810H toughness certification.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Q8mQzfL9E3gxDDbmaRvZsj" name="google-pixel-watch-3-mid-workout-options.jpg" alt="Mid-workout options on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q8mQzfL9E3gxDDbmaRvZsj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Watch 7 has a 300mAh or 425mAh battery capacity, depending on which size you pick. WPC-based fast charging is supported. In our testing, the 44mm variant lasted two days with the AOD (always-on display) disabled. Your mileage may vary based on your usage pattern. </p><p>We haven&apos;t tested the Watch 3 yet, but Google is claiming 24-hour battery life with AOD enabled and up to 36 hours in Battery Saver mode, and health tracking is still functioning. The 41mm variant of the Watch 3 has the same capacity of 306mAh as the Watch 2, and if we don&apos;t adjust for any software improvements, we should expect similar battery life compared to last year&apos;s model. The 45mm will definitely do better, thanks to its larger 420mAh battery.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 packs a ton of health and fitness tracking features. Thanks to the new processor, the interface is slick and smooth, and readings are far more accurate than previous models due to the new layout of the sensors. Sleep tracking and SpO2 monitoring work well, but some features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">sleep apnea monitoring</a> and ECG require a Samsung Galaxy phone to work. </p><p>We found Samsung&apos;s medication reminder to be a useful feature, and activity tracking has always been solid on the Galaxy Watch. Best of all, you can access all these features without having to pay for any sort of subscription. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTBgD6CtsrdwzTmveZFbUc" name="google-pixel-watch-3-camera-viewfinder-controls.jpg" alt="Camera Viewfinder on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTBgD6CtsrdwzTmveZFbUc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel Watch 3&apos;s premium health tracking features are behind a paywall. You get a six-month Fitbit Premium subscription for free, but you&apos;ll need to pay after that to continue accessing run and workout recommendations and deeper insights into your health tracking. Thankfully, the readiness score is now available for everyone, even if you don&apos;t subscribe. </p><p>Tracking a run is now more comprehensive, and it has the ability to add timed warmups and cooldowns. Morning Brief gives you a summary of how well you slept, the progress of your activity goals, and more. You can also use the Pixel Watch 3 as a viewfinder to control the camera on your Pixel phone, now with the ability to switch camera modes. This way, you can set up the shot and check framing through the watch itself.</p>

<p>This should come as no surprise, but I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for most users. Whether this is your first smartwatch or you&apos;re upgrading from an old one, the new Watch 7 offers excellent features and performance for the price. In fact, the older Watch 6 is a better bargain if you&apos;re not too finicky about health tracking and just want a reliable smartwatch for notifications and reminders. </p><p>I&apos;m sure there&apos;ll be takers for the Pixel Watch 3 if you have the money to spend. In fact, this might be a good time to try and score a good deal on the Pixel Watch 2 since the hardware is mostly the same, and most of the new software features should eventually come to it. The 45mm Watch 3 is a bit too expensive to recommend, and you should consider it only if you <em>must </em>have a larger dial size. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-01.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Obsidian" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5VRabFbfGinbLoqNxmwif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series phones</a>, introduced at Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a> in mid-August 2024, boast tons of upgrades compared to the previous generation Pixel 8 series. From the new look with a camera bar to updated finishes with silky matte glass back and metal sides, they are also more durable.</p><p>Seven years of updates means that every time Google announces a new version of Android beyond the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> version these devices come loaded with, you will be able to download it. The devices will support the OS and function as they should. While there’s no telling what features may arrive by 2031, even if the phones can’t run some of the more advanced features that could be coming down the pike more than five years from now, Google assures that the phones will continue to work. </p><p>Arguably, most importantly, Google promises to continue to support the phones with security updates. Thus, even if they can’t support every exciting feature that comes by the end of this decade, they will be updated with all the safety and security necessities to ensure they run smoothly and, most importantly, safely. Chances are you’ll be ready to upgrade the phones before they reach end-of-life, which means they’ll have great resale, trade-in, or hand-me-down value as well.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EoXNaGtnUZxHDdh2msjRXm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-pink.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL in Pink" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoXNaGtnUZxHDdh2msjRXm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL differ only in size, with the former measuring 6.3 inches and the latter 6.8 inches for those who want more screen real estate. The Pixel 9 Pro XL also boasts slightly more power and faster charging speeds, but beyond that, all specs are the same as the Pixel 9 Pro. </p><p>The entry Pixel 9 is still packed with tons of premium features, not far off from the specs found in the step-up devices. The most notable thing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro</a> is missing is a telephoto camera on the non-Pro model, and it has a much lower resolution front camera, down from 42MP in the Pixel 9 Pro to just 10.5MP in the Pixel 9. You won’t get an Ultra-Wideband chip, and there’s no temperature sensor. There are some camera features missing, too, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, Zoom Enhance, Night Sight Video, and Super Res Zoom Video. So, if you shoot a lot of videos, it would make sense to upgrade to the Google Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Nonetheless, all three phones come powered by the new Google Tensor G4, have tons of AI features included that the processor allows them to run, and include new Google Gemini features, like Gemini Live for conversational chats for Gemini Advanced subscribers. With features like Pixel Studio for unique image generation, Pixel Screenshots for analyzing the context of your screenshots so you can easily find them in a searchable database, and Add Me to add yourself to group photos while you take them, these phones take the cake in the line-up. </p><p>Considering that the Google Pixel 9 series phones can last for seven years — that’s an entire middle and high school run and longer than you might even keep your computer — you’ll want to keep them well protected. Once you choose the model you want, opt for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">best Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors">Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro screen protectors</a> to further protect your investment. As long as you take care of the phone you choose, the Pixel 9 series devices will likely outlast your desire for them.</p>

<p>While the Google Pixel 9 might be missing some of the bells and whistles its higher-end sisters have, it’s still a premium device offered at a reasonable price. With seven years of OS and security updates as well as Feature Drops, you can rest assured that you’re getting great value with this phone, which is far from being an “entry level” device.</p></p>

<p>Almost identical in looks and specs to the Google Pixel 9, the Google Pixel 9 Pro adds a few more features relating to the cameras and video recording. But by and large, they are similar to one another. Nonetheless, if you feel you’ll make use of these features, notably for content creators, the upgrade is worth it.

<p>If you want a much larger screen, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is the way to go. Also supported by seven years of OS and security updates along with Feature Drops, this phone has the biggest screen in the line (with the exception of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold). It’s more powerful and charges faster, too, so this is the option for power users.</p></p>

<ul><li>Google states that a camera feature it debuted during I/O 2023 is finally rolling out on the Pixel 8 Pro alongside availability for Pro model Pixel 9 devices.</li><li>"Zoom Enhance" leverages the device's AI software to "intelligently" process a zoom to keep a photo's high quality.</li><li>Made by Google 2024 was packed with new AI features like Gemini Live, the revamped Pixel Screenshot, and the Pixel 9's new "Add Me" camera function.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is sneaking in a photo feature for the Pixel 9 that you might&apos;ve forgotten about. Zoom Enhance, originally announced at Google I/O 2023 for the Pixel 8 Pro, will arrive on both Pixel 9 and 8 phones soon. </p><p>Zoom Enhance aims to fix the typical quality drop you get when you zoom in too far for a far-off photo. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-ai-camera-features/#:~:text=even%20more%20with-,Zoom%20Enhance,-%E2%80%94%20even%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve">Google blog post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219750/google-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-9-pro-feature">The Verge</a>) includes the feature among a number of other recently announced features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> and Reimagine with Magic Editor.</p><p>Google states that users zooming into a photo will leverage the on-device AI software as it "intelligently fills in the gaps between pixels and predicts fine details." Ultimately, the feature is designed to help keep a photo&apos;s quality high as you zoom in to isolate certain aspects.</p><p>Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh first introduced the feature at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2023-everything-announced">Made by Google 2023</a>, saying it would let users "get closer than ever, even when you forget to zoom" through the camera. Despite being tapped to arrive on the Pixel 8 series relatively quickly, it had a longer development cycle than expected.</p><p>As highlighted by The Verge, the Zoom Enhance example looks a bit lackluster, not showing a significant improvement in quality (we can&apos;t upload the GIF here, so check the blog to see it). We&apos;ll need to test Zoom Enhance for ourselves to see if it was worth the wait, or if Google had to compromise on its original goal with the AI feature.</p>

<p>The company states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">9 Pro Fold</a> will have this feature. What&apos;s more, the company is bringing it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> today (August 15).</p><p>There&apos;s a lot to digest regarding the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google</a> event, but one of the highlights revolves around the Pixel 9&apos;s wealth of AI features and camera enhancements. With the Pixel 9 Pro, for instance, you can get 20X Super Res Zoom or auto-enhance videos to 8K quality.</p><p>One Made by Google revelation was a new version of its AI model, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a>. This is its most "conversational" variant. Users can communicate with the AI about an extensive range of topics and (ideally) receive some relevant information in return.</p><p>The revamped version of Pixel Screenshots enters alongside Pixel Studio for AI assistance when storing or using a prompt to generate a photo.</p><p>The other side of Google&apos;s new features is one for the Pixel 9&apos;s camera called "Add Me." The company performed a live demonstration during the event with NBA star Jimmy Butler. Users can snap a photo through Add Me and freeze that memory in time. They can then swap places with one of the subjects so they can be photographed.</p><p>The result is a photo that looks like you or anything else was always in the frame to begin with.</p>

<p>Zack Nelson, host of the JerryRigEverything channel, chose the new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL to put through his brutal durability test gauntlet. It showed its durability in some areas but received criticism in others.</p><p>He measured the Pixel 9 Pro XL and found the camera visor adds another 3.5mm of thickness on top of its official 8mm, jokingly calling it "one Oreo cookie biscuit thick." That aside, he praised Google&apos;s shift to flat glass, calling curved glass "a nightmare for durability and repairability."</p><p>During his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DLWBWrK31U&ab_channel=JerryRigEverything">durability test</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> showed signs of damage at level 6 of the Moh Scale of Hardness. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen showed more pronounced grooves of damage at level 7. </p><p>For comparison, when Nelson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-jre-durability-test">tested the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, he found that it only scratched at level 7 and had deeper grooves at level 8, thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">Gorilla Armor</a>. The Pixel 9 Pro XL display is still tough, but you may want to invest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p>Nelson proceeded to the burn portion of the test, where the display lasted 30 seconds against a lighter.</p><p>The channel&apos;s host then put the device through the ever-crucial bend test — and the 9 Pro XL surprisingly held strong. Nelson stated that it&apos;s expected for a phone that large to have some sort of give or even a heart-stopping <em>creak</em>. However, Google&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro XL barely gave in either direction when bent and didn&apos;t even make a sound.</p><p>You can catch Zack Nelson&apos;s full durability test breakdown of the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The video shows off the scratchy durability of the camera visor and the reliability of the in-display fingerprint scanner under severe damage.</p>

<p>Despite how strong Google&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro XL may be, we&apos;d still recommend picking up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cases">a good case</a> — just in case.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google</a> behind us, we were able to get a solid look at the latest edition to the Pixel lineup: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">9 Pro XL</a>. With smaller bezels and a large display, the XL model features a 6.8-inch Super Actua display with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. Consumers can grab the device with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of internal storage.</p><p>Additionally, thanks to Gemini, the 9 Pro XL alongside the rest of the Pixel 9 cast benefit from a new wave of AI features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live</a> is the company&apos;s new conversational feature that users can lean on for a variety of topics. Users will also find a revamped version of Pixel Screenshots.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL officially launches on August 22, when you can put it through its paces yourself — hopefully without scratching it up.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is adding the AI-powered Circle to Search to certain Galaxy A-series phones, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablets following suit.</li><li>By late August, Circle to Search will be available on Galaxy A models like the A55, A54, A35, and A34, but not yet on entry-level models like the A15 or A25.</li><li>Circle to Search allows users to quickly get information by circling, highlighting, or tapping parts of photos, text, images, or videos.</li></ul>

<p>Samsung is rolling out its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature to select Galaxy A-series phones, with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablets next in line.</p><p>Google&apos;s Circle to Search is a fresh way to steer users to its search engine. First launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series in January, this feature has since made its way to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">premium Samsung phones</a> like the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6, along with some Google-branded products.</p><p>The Circle to Search feature is now making its way to certain Galaxy A models like the A55, A54, A35, and A34, with availability expected in late August, as per the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-circle-to-search-to-galaxy-a-series-and-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-series" target="_blank">announcement</a>. But it is not clear when it will be available on Samsung&apos;s entry-level devices, like the Galaxy A15 or A25.</p><p>Later, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Galaxy Tab S9 FE and S9 FE Plus</a> will also get the Circle to Search feature in an upcoming update.</p><p>Circle to Search lets users dive into content with simple gestures. Just circle, highlight, or tap on parts of a photo, text, image, or video to instantly pull up related information without jumping between apps.</p><p>Google uses visual search technology to find and show relevant information based on what you select in an image or document.</p><p>It&apos;s no shock that Circle to Search stands out among the AI features in the Galaxy S24 series. Its seamless link to Google Search, a key part of the Android experience, gives it a real edge.</p><p>Samsung plans to start rolling out the update for these devices this month, but it’ll be a gradual process. This means updates might come at different times, depending on your region and device model.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s great that Samsung is bringing AI features like Circle to Search to its mid-range Galaxy A series. This fits with the trend of making advanced tools accessible to more people.</p><p>With Google continuously improving the feature, users can expect an even better Circle to Search experience on more devices.</p>

Over that span of time, we&apos;ve seen Samsung release both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Fold 6, while the OnePlus Open entered the fray. No matter what phone you currently own, you might be wondering if you should upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p><p>Although we were excited to see Google join the mix with its first attempt, the Pixel Fold fell a bit short of expectations in a few different ways. However, given Google&apos;s previous track record, it&apos;s definitely understandable if you&apos;re on the fence about moving over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-overhaul-fixes-a-lot-of-complaints-2">Design overhaul fixes a lot of complaints</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-rear.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold rear view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eEe5APmjLXtUW4vzNFmvyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that Google absolutely nailed with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it&apos;s the brand-new design. It&apos;s difficult to even believe that this new phone and the Pixel Fold came from the same company, as the changes are incredibly drastic. For one, Google understands that people don&apos;t want a compromised experience, regardless of whether you&apos;re using the cover screen or the massive inner display.</p><p>App compatibility with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> continues to be a headache despite the form factor being around for more than six years. In an effort to reduce potential issues, the displays will better adapt to the apps that you use. This is especially true when using apps on the inner screen on a split screen, as the aspect ratio makes it feel like you&apos;re using two apps at the same time without awkward layouts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking-angled.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inner screen has also been upgraded in a number of ways, starting with the improved hinge. You&apos;ll no longer have to worry about the phone not being able to unfold to 180 degrees, something that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> owners experienced. It&apos;s about as good as you might have hoped, offering a smooth and satisfying "pop" when either folding or unfolding the phone.</p>

<p>One of the biggest complaints about the Pixel Fold was that it only enjoyed a few months of being the best phone that Google offered. As soon as the Pixel 8 lineup was introduced with the Tensor G3, the Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-hope-google-doesnt-limit-assistant-with-bard">immediately felt obsolete</a>. This feeling was driven home even further after it was revealed that the $1,800 Fold would lack features found in phones that cost at least $1,000 less.</p><p>Thankfully, Google learned from its mistakes this time around, as the 9 Pro Fold shares the same Tensor G4 SoC as its contemporaries. At least in terms of what&apos;s possible, all four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> models enjoy largely the same set of software features. Of course, this includes all of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> features, such as Gemini Live, Pixel Screenshots, Super Res Zoom, and more.</p>

<p>By now, you might be asking yourself why spring for the 9 Pro Fold if the less expensive phones can do the same things. Well, that&apos;s where the foldable phone aspect comes into play. Pull the phone out of your pocket, and you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, albeit one that&apos;s a bit thicker than you might be used to.</p><p>While the 6.3-inch screen is fine for pretty much everything, there are times when you&apos;re doing something and have a bit more space to stretch out. Just open the Fold, and now you have a screen that&apos;s even bigger than our beloved Nexus 7. And when you&apos;re done, close it shut and throw it back into your pocket without wishing you still had JNCO jeans or cargo shorts.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-shouldn-apos-t-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-2">Why you shouldn&apos;t upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides adapting to a different form factor, the biggest barrier to upgrading to a foldable phone is the cost. Even with some pretty great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-preorder-deals" target="_blank">pre-order deals</a>, the $1,800 price tag can still hit you with a bit of sticker shock. This is part of the reason why Samsung is seeing more success with the Galaxy Z Flip line, while Motorola is content in sticking with the flip form factor instead of venturing into the book-style foldable.</p><p>Not helping matters is something that we consider to be a reason in favor of upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and that&apos;s the feature parity with the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. Even when matching up the storage configuration (the Fold starts with 256GB), the Pixel 9 Pro XL is $700 less than the 9 Pro Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-obsidian-01.jpg" alt="An Obsidian Google Pixel 9 next to a Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M2GtqXC29EQEJyxDFafvDJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the same price as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with 256GB of storage, you can get the 9 Pro XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a>, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 and will still have a few bucks left over to snag a case or extra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">watch band</a>. That&apos;s one tough pill to swallow, especially if you&apos;re potentially looking to dive head-first into the Pixel ecosystem.</p><p>Another detractor to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is that it still lacks stylus support, something Samsung has featured in the Galaxy Z Fold series since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review">Fold 3</a> in 2021. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> technically supports the use of a stylus, although that&apos;s not in an official capacity and is only possible if you import the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/using-oppo-pen-with-oneplus-open">OPPO Pen</a>. This might not be a deal-breaker for some, but it could definitely play a factor if you&apos;re upgrading from an older Galaxy Z Fold.</p><p>Lastly, there is a sentiment with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> that these expensive phones still feel as though they&apos;re being treated as second-class citizens in the camera department. We have only minimal upgrades with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s camera, while the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL will arguably provide better photos and videos.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s even an inkling that you <em>might</em> want to upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, just give it a shot. We aren&apos;t talking about buying one and returning it if you don&apos;t like it, but head over to your local big box store and mess around with the display models. Obviously, this doesn&apos;t give you the full picture of what to expect, but it should be enough to whet your whistle before making a final decision.</p><p>In the meantime, you can look forward to our review of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which is currently in progress.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has stopped selling a few of its past-gen Pixel devices, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re gone for good.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/13/google-pixel-fold-7-pro-stops-sales/">9to5Google</a>, Google seemingly removed the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 7, and the Pixel 7 Pro from the featured device list for "Phones" on its online store before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a>. However, scrolling over in the carousel and clicking "Compare phones" shows that the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are still available to purchase.</p><p>Consumers can pick up the former for $599 while the Pro model runs for $899. Interestingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> is still featured on that highlight carousel before shifting to the Pixel 8 series.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won&apos;t find the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> anywhere on the Google Store. When surfaced through the "Compare" section, the device appears with a "no longer available" label. The publication stated that any attempt to purchase the original Pixel Fold would send users over to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>Surfacing the device through the comparison method doesn&apos;t offer a chance to click. Instead, users are shown the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> and Pixel 9 Pro Fold initially, likely as a bit of a teaser to grab what&apos;s new.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google about the availability of certain Pixel devices. In return, the company stated that the original Pixel Fold will return to the online store <em>after </em>the Pixel 9 Pro Fold goes public. We also asked if the Fold and the Pixel 8 series will return at a discount, but did not receive confirmation.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold launches alongside the Pixel 9 Pro on September 4, while the base Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL launch on August 22.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="C9c5D62k2VgF5RncTriE4G" name="google-pixel-fold-no-longer-available-temporary.jpg" alt="The original Pixel Fold is no longer available on the Pixel store, but this is temporary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C9c5D62k2VgF5RncTriE4G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We asked Google about a potential Pixel Fold discount based on its past behavior. Typically, Google will bring past series back at a slightly reduced price. Either Google has yet to decide on a discount, or it doesn&apos;t want people to skip the new 9 Pro Fold because of the promise of a cheaper Pixel Fold. Nevertheless, we won&apos;t have long to wait to see what happens.</p><p>The company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">the full Pixel 9 series</a> alongside the Pixel 9 Pro Fold earlier this week. The slab phone featured three editions: the base Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The series can reach screen heights of 6.8 inches, the Tensor G4, 16GB RAM (Pro models), and boasts even more Gemini-powered AI.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold takes what the first one started and runs with it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Our hands-on</a> highlighted its external 6.3-inch display and the much more expansive 8-inch inner display. Additionally, Google upgraded the internal performance of the device by providing an up-to-date chip: the Tensor G4.</p><p>Despite its official September 4 release date, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9_pro_fold" target="_blank">Google Store</a> shows that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold won&apos;t arrive until mid-September, and some editions have already begun to sold out. Perhaps a cheaper Pixel Fold will tempt those that missed out on buying the newer foldable next month.</p>
