<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 Pro’s camera bar is reportedly peeling off, raising concerns about a possible design flaw.</li><li>Cases suggest the problem may let dust and water in, hinting at a structural weakness.</li><li>Initially quick to replace affected devices, Google’s support has since been criticized for dismissing complaints after the 90-day period.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s camera bar, first seen on the Pixel 6 series, was meant to be a standout feature. But with the Pixel 9 Pro, it seems Google might’ve missed the mark—users are reporting that the camera bar is peeling off the back of the phone.</p><p>Back in October, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1g65ybp/9_pro_camera_bar_popped_off/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> with a wonky camera bar caught everyone’s attention. The owner said the bar was coming loose from the phone’s body, which was pretty weird since they claimed it had been in a case the whole time and never took a tumble or got damaged.</p><p>This whole thing kind of screams “design flaw” or maybe a factory oopsie. Either way, it’s a reminder that even the fanciest devices can have some serious growing pains.</p><p>Now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9-pro-camera-bar-breaking-again/" target="_blank">Android Police</a> first reported, Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1ia6b3q/pixel_9_pro_camera_bar_is_separating_from_phone/" target="_blank">MohiFlaz</a> shared their frustrating experience with the Pixel 9 Pro. They went into full protective mode right away after buying the phone three months ago. They’ve been super careful with it too, with no drops or rough treatment. But despite all that TLC, the camera bar is still coming loose.</p><p>When the first incident popped up, Google was quick to send a replacement. But now, MohiFlaz is calling out Google for their less-than-stellar response this time around.</p><p>In the comments, the user didn’t hold back and vented about their experience with Google Support. As per the comment, Google Support basically shrugged them off because the phone is over 90 days old. So now they’re stuck between a rock and a hard place, probably looking at forking over some cash to get it fixed elsewhere.</p><p>In both cases, the camera bar started peeling from the top edge, opening up gaps that could let water and dust sneak in. Given how similar these cases are, it’s pretty likely Google knows about the 9 Pro’s structural issues. But despite that, the phone’s still sitting on store shelves, which makes you wonder if they’re just hoping no one notices.</p>

<p>We have reached out to Google for a statement and will update this post when we hear back.</p><p>Since Google hasn’t said much about why the camera bar is peeling off or how to stop it, it’s probably smart to play it safe. Slapping on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">best Pixel 9 Pro cases</a> might be your best move.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series didn’t take down the big players, but it did set new sales records for Google. However, the last thing Google needs now is bad press, so handling unhappy customers with care will be key.</p>

The Chinese startup burst into the limelight back in December after debuting the R1, a model that uses self-checking mechanisms to reason and deliver accurate answers to complex questions.</p>

<p>Most chatbots today — like ChatGPT and Gemini — use inference models to come up with an answer, and they're trained on billions of inputs. While they excel at generalized queries, they struggle with solving complex coding and math problems, but this is slowly changing. OpenAI rolled out its o1 reasoning model at the end of last year, and it uses chain-of-thought — where it runs through multiple steps — to come up with an answer. <br><br>DeepSeek is challenging the status quo with its own solution. The DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model that's built on the V3 large language model, and what's noteworthy about it is that it is claimed to be developed at a fraction of the cost of what U.S. entities are doing. Essentially, DeepSeek says it spent under $6 million to train its model, which is ridiculous — U.S. brands invested hundreds of millions of dollars in training each model, and billions in infrastructure. <br><br>Oh, and you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deepseek.com/">don't need to pay anything to use it</a>. It's the latter point that's causing so much consternation; to give you some context, OpenAI charges $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro, which is built on the o1 model. With DeepSeek R1, you get something that's just as good — for absolutely free. This runs counter to the fundamental ideal of Silicon Valley, where the tenet is that if there's a halfway- decent product, the main goal is to monetize it. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NPbycu6Qsu2DJFVLqAEmC4" name="DeepSeek" alt="DeepSeek AI Assistant with R1 reasoning model running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPbycu6Qsu2DJFVLqAEmC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>DeepSeek is doing things a bit differently; it open-sourced the r1, so anyone can take a look under the hood to see how it runs, or modify it as they see fit. It's no wonder, then, that DeepSeek climbed to the top of the App Store charts after just a week of availability. Its introduction had a seismic effect on the sector as a whole; the U.S. stock market lost a cumulative $1 trillion in value, with NVIDIA alone losing $589 billion in market value — the most by any organization on a single day.</p><p>Obviously, the market will correct itself, and the panic will ease as U.S. companies seek out ways to catch up — OpenAI is already touting that it will roll out "better models." But what DeepSeek exceled at doing is democratizing cutting-edge AI and making it accessible to everyone, and that alone is the biggest signal that the next big breakthrough in this category may not come from Silicon Valley after all. <br><br>While I'm not keen on generative AI, I dabble with ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude occasionally, and they clearly have their use cases. Reasoning models, however, are actually interesting; they have the ability to use logical reasoning and understand context, so if you ask a follow-up question, you get relevant answers. The best part is that all of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deepseek.chat">runs on your phone</a> — I had no issues using the AI assistant on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and Nubia Z70 Ultra among others. <br><br>They're particularly great at solving math problems and creative thinking, and more than anything else, this is where DeepSeek's R1 fulfils its potential. And best of all, it doesn't cost you anything to use it. The breakneck pace of this industry and the staggering amounts of money being thrown at anyone building AI tech means we don't have to wait too long to witness the next big milestone.</p>

<hr>
<p>A Chinese AI startup called DeepSeek seems to be outperforming Big Tech’s models with way less money and resources, and it’s totally rattling the U.S. tech sector.</p><p>DeepSeek has sent shockwaves through global markets with its latest AI launch. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/tech-stocks-react-chinas-deepseek-sparks-us-worries-ai-race-rcna189394" target="_blank">NBC News</a>, the Nasdaq Composite dropped over 3%. The Dow managed to recover, closing up nearly 300 points after a rough start, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%.</p><p>Nvidia, a major player in AI, took a massive hit Monday, losing a staggering $593 billion in market value as tech stocks tanked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports. This was due to fears that DeepSeek has jumped ahead of the U.S. in the AI race. This marks the biggest one-day loss any company has ever seen on Wall Street.</p><p>DeepSeek isn’t holding back—the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1hqjimz/deepseek_claims_they_beat_openais_01_model_on/" target="_blank">saying</a> its AI is just as good, if not better, than the top U.S. models, all while costing way less. That bold claim has sent Nvidia and other AI chipmakers into a tailspin, with their stocks taking a serious hit.</p><p>Launched in 2023, this Hangzhou-based startup rolled out its first large language model before that year was even over.</p><p>DeepSeek started turning heads in the AI world last month after dropping a new model that it claims rivals top U.S. players like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-code-suggests-default-assistant-android">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a>, while being way more efficient with pricey Nvidia chips for training on massive datasets.</p><p>The startup’s open AI model, DeepSeek V3, is crushing it on popular benchmarks. Despite its size, it’s super efficient, breezing through tasks like coding and essay writing.</p><p>Obviously, what’s got some U.S. tech watchers nervous is how this Chinese startup has managed to keep pace with top American generative AI players while spending way less cash.</p><p>If that’s true, it makes you wonder if U.S. tech companies are blowing through cash for data centers and chips when there might be a cheaper, smarter way to keep AI moving forward.</p>

<hr>
<p>Garmin watch users had a rough Tuesday morning dealing with their wearables as most of them were in a frozen state.</p><p>Several users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1ibz59m/have_a_useless_watch_now/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/live/garmin-down-reports-surface-of-many-garmin-watches-crashing-are-you-affected">Reddit</a> to report that their Garmin watches have become practically useless and stuck on the boot screen. Some of these wearables have been displaying a blue triangle as well (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/live/garmin-down-reports-surface-of-many-garmin-watches-crashing-are-you-affected">Techradar</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, this issue is affecting users in the UK, US, India, and France. Some devices that have been reported so far are  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Forerunners </a>(265, 965, 255, and 955)<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-review">,  Garmin Venu 2 </a>and 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmins-fenix-7-smartwatches-announced">Garmin Fenix 7</a>, and Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2, but there could be more devices are facing this issue.</p><p>There is not much information as to what caused this widespread issue, however, some users have been speculating that it could be a network-related error or the company's systems are down. However, Connect Garmin's Status <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://connect.garmin.com/status/">website</a> indicated that Activity Uploads are down.</p>

<p>Just sharing - my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/garmin-forerunner-255s-music">Garmin Forerunner 255 Music</a> was faced with the infinity loop issue currently ongoing. No particular trigger, the one moment I received a Teams message, the other it was black-screen and rebooting. Happened at precisely 12 (midday)," a user told Techradar in an email.</p><p>Reddit users have come up with their workaround of a hard reset even before the company addressed the issue. This even caused some users to lose their data on the device. Other users who contacted support say that they heard an automated message saying they are aware of reports of the blue triangle and they're working on a fix.</p><p>Later, Garmin put up a red banner on their UK website officially acknowledging the issue that reads, "We are researching reports of devices displaying a blue triangle when starting a GPS activity. Holding the power button until the unit powers off, and then turning it back on may restore functionality temporarily. We will provide more information on a permanent fix when available."</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing has a new event geared up for March 4 — right around MWC.</li><li>The launch teaser hints at a new hardware launch that will include glyph interfaces.</li><li>It is still unclear what to expect from the launch event, but it is expected to be either Phone 3 or Phone 3a, and also a bunch of audio products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The anticipation around Phone 3 keeps building up, and Nothing is now having a hardware launch slated this March as the company just teased. However, it is still unclear what the product is, but it surely looks like a phone launch.</p><p>According to the latest teaser, a new phone launch is likely scheduled for March 4 at 10 a.m. GMT. Like the signature Nothing products, the upcoming device will also have a glyph interface, likely right around the camera visor.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/9MmuzleJai<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1884210887025959065">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While the Phone 3 from Nothing is long overdue, as its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> came back in 2023, it still needs to be determined what we will see at the March event. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/27/nothing-phone-3-march-launch-date-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, however, it could be Phone 3a rather than the flagship Phone 3, per a recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/12ushabh/status/1883904862020338059">spotted e-commerce listing</a>.</p><p>A Flipkart e-commerce listing (now removed) teaser of the upcoming event has indicated that it is indeed a Phone 3a launch and not the Phone 3 itself. The launch time also hints at the same, as it just falls around the Mobile World Congress event happening from March 3-6 in Barcelona. For the uninitiated, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> was released during the same event last year.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WIP 📱 pic.twitter.com/L3c5K356W0<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1882369936183665088">January 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nothing has also shared some sketches of the upcoming product that the company is currently working on. There are a bunch of sketches, which don’t precisely reveal the product and it’s also a wild guess whether it is Phone 3 or the Phone 3a or whether it is a phone after all.</p><p>At a glance though, they appear to be sketches of a phone internal or probably some of the glyph interface we might probably get to see after the product launch.</p><p>Lastly, alongside the Phone 2a launch last year, the company’s sub-brand had also released CMF Buds and Neckband. The teaser could also mean that we might also see their successors with the hint of glyph interface integration for the first time on the company’s affordable range, which is a wild guess and to be taken into consideration with a grain of salt.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Xiaomi clearly knows how to make great-sounding audio products on a budget, and the Sound Outdoor is no different. The Bluetooth speaker is available in vibrant colors, and a big part of its allure is the 30W sound it is able to produce. Combine that with IP67 ingress protection, and you get a speaker that nails the basics. <br><br>As is often the case with Xiaomi's audio products, affordability is a key selling point of the Sound Outdoor. The speaker was introduced in China back in May 2024, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/mi-sound-outdoor-30w-ip67-upto-12-hours-playback-30-w-bluetooth-speaker/p/itm17099bbcfdd72">costs ₹3,999 ($46) in India</a>; a great value when you consider the feature-set. You can also pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Bluetooth-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B0D9ZXFX9C">on Amazon in the U.S. for $65</a>, and if you want to go the reseller route, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005006902377465.html">listed at AliExpress for $49</a>. If you want to buy it in the U.K., you'll need to shell out £35 ($44).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsEi82iWP4FWY4fEa2dUj8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Tribit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tribit-stormbox-2-review">StormBox 2</a> and most new products in this segment, the Sound Outdoor has a cylindrical design that makes it easy to take anywhere. There's a carrying hook at the top that allows you to dangle it from a bag, and the bright orange hue does a great job accentuating the otherwise-muted black color scheme. If you need a bit of vibrancy, the speaker is available in blue and red color variants as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qhXjFx562ZRmFLD9zDTr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The outer surface of the Sound Outdoor is coated in fabric with a mesh covering, and it feels great to hold. You get rubber feet on one side, and Xiaomi's logo is emblazoned at the front, but as it's in the same color as the fabric, it isn't as visible. The playback controls are mounted at the top of the Sound Outdoor, and you get volume up/down along with a multifunction button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ARfR9234WnRda6RNTb3Kd8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back of the unit houses the power button, Bluetooth pairing mode, USB-C port (hidden behind a gasket), and a stereo pairing button. Interestingly, Xiaomi says you can connect the Sound Outdoor with 99 other speakers, creating an array totaling 100 units. But as the manufacturer sent over just the one unit for testing, I wasn't able to see if this feature is any good. Regardless, it should be good enough in stereo mode as well, so if you want a wider soundstage, picking up two of these is a good option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5wKmMD6WFxabL5YJXqoZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Either end of the Sound Outdoor has a passive radiator that does a good job creating a vibrant sound, and the speaker itself contains two driver units — a 20W woofer and a 10W tweeter. The combined 30W sound is among the best in this category, and it does a decent enough job in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kt6hnsjq4Ntqg7HVzNDth8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kt6hnsjq4Ntqg7HVzNDth8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi's audio gear has a characteristic sound with a bass-heavy sound signature, and that's the case with the Sound Outdoor as well. You get a good energy in the low-end along with clear mids and recessed highs, and the overall tonality lends itself well to casual listening. As the name suggests, this speaker's main attraction is that it can be used outdoors, and in that context, I have no issues with the sound.</p>

<p>To that effect, you get IP67 dust and water resistance, making the Sound Outdoor immune to any inclement weather conditions. I used it in the shower, and the carrying hook means you can easily dangle it on a shower caddy. Coming in at 597g, it isn't too heavy either, and the easy portability combined with the powerful sound makes it a great choice for use in the home or outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H8KWAjywaQx4oMJebRehZ8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H8KWAjywaQx4oMJebRehZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn't see any issues with Bluetooth connectivity either; the speaker has Bluetooth 5.4, and I paired it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. You don't get any Bluetooth codecs outside of the standard SBC and AAC, but again, that's good enough in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="E4pLmoxjU5Eaqqf9Yhfbk8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4pLmoxjU5Eaqqf9Yhfbk8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems with battery life either. The Sound Outdoor has a 2600mAh battery, and it lasted just over eight and a half hours in my testing, with the volume turned up (obviously). It charges via 15W USB PD (5W/3A), so you can use just about any charger with the speaker. However, as there's no fast charging, it takes over two and a half hours to charge the Sound Outdoor, so I'd suggest plugging it in at night.</p>

<p>If you need better sound, I highly recommend the StormBox 2 — it is my go-to portable speaker these days. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Bluetooth-Surround-Waterproof/dp/B0CW933QSJ">costlier at $69</a>, but you get a richer sound, better battery, and I like the design a little better. The StormBox 2 can also be used in stereo mode, and you get extensive customizability when it comes to the sound.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you want something that isn't as big, Xiaomi's Sound Pocket has the same design in a smaller and lighter chassis. The speaker also gets IP67 ingress protection, and while the 5W driver doesn't get anywhere as loud or detailed, it is decent enough in its own right. It also uses a cavity to create a louder sound, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Portable-Wireless-Bluetooh-Resistance/dp/B0CZRLRGM5">costs $39 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tw2r6jeyDupM2R3m6W7f8" name="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor" alt="Xiaomi Sound Outdoor Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tw2r6jeyDupM2R3m6W7f8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Sound Outdoor is another win for Xiaomi. The speaker looks good, has a great sound, and doesn't cost as much as its rivals. In short, this is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best budget Bluetooth speakers</a> you can get today.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While TerraMaster always had a good selection of budget-focused models, the brand undertook an ambitious overhaul last year in a bid to target the high-end segment. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/terramaster-f8-ssd-plus-review">tested the all-flash F8 SSD Plus</a> when it debuted, and came away thinking the brand did a great job not just on the hardware side, but also the software. <br><br>With the F4-424 Max, TerraMaster is looking to continue that momentum. The 4-bay NAS has the best hardware package in its category, including two 10GbE ports, a 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of upgradeable RAM, and four traditional drive bays in addition to two M.2 slots. <br><br>Combine that with the changes to TOS 6 software, and the F4-424 Max has the potential to be one of the best 4-bay NAS models you can buy today, particularly if you're looking to build a high-end Plex server. I used the NAS for over two months, and here's why I think it is a better choice than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>.</p>

<p>TerraMaster unveiled the F4-424 Max in Q4 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. It retails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">for $899 on Amazon</a>, and if you don't need dual 10GbE connectivity, there's a standard F4-424 with dual 2.5GbE ports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0CPP5GDZ3">that costs $499</a>. This variant is powered by the Intel N95 and shares a similar design. There's also an F4-424 Pro that has a Core i3-N305 and 16GB of memory along with dual 2.5GbE connectivity, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DDXLCLV7">that model is $649</a>.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-design"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HtFwVJbGEMqsYf876PwAZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TerraMaster's earlier offerings stood out because of their distinctive aluminum enclosures, and while the design was intriguing, they didn't have the best thermal efficiency. The brand is addressing that with the F4-424 Max by switching to a more modest aesthetic, with a black chassis that doesn't attract as much attention.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Qvy84U34AveBCWfWFG2dU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's notable is that the sides are ventilated — similar to what you get with the DS923+ — allowing better airflow into the NAS. The server is smaller than other 4-bay NAS models I tested recently, and as is always the case with TerraMaster, you get a 120W external power brick.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YRg75AWb3AX5WcdLq7rUYU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRg75AWb3AX5WcdLq7rUYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like that there's now a 120mm fan at the back, and it does a fantastic job ensuring the drives don't overheat. As an added bonus, it doesn't get loud either. TerraMaster has a new design for the drive bays as well, with a push-to-latch mechanism that's easy to use. The brand finally switched to a tool-free drive installation, and this makes slotting in 3.5-inch HDDs significantly easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VNHpoK3JjGJrpmu5nFt2gU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VNHpoK3JjGJrpmu5nFt2gU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there isn't much else at the front. You get the usual status LEDs, and while most NAS models have a USB port that lets you plug in a drive, that isn't the case here — all the ports are located at the back. Interestingly, even the power button is at the back, with TerraMaster opting to go with a clean look up front that doesn't look too busy. <br><br>The changes to the design deliver meaningful benefits. The F4-424 Max has much better ventilation, and the chassis doesn't stand out quite as much, blending into the background.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-ports-and-connectivity"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Ports and connectivity</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ndARLRPwWhuh8wRnwmKMWU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the fact that you're getting two 10 Gigabit ports at the back of the NAS is the biggest differentiator, and it gives it a distinct edge — particularly when you consider that the DS923+ has dual Ethernet connectivity. You don't get the ability to add an additional port, but that shouldn't be an issue to anyone considering this NAS; with a 20Gbps addressable bandwidth, you don't have to worry about the network connection being the bottleneck.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLwNVDPiGpr6jZ62RBaAgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are two USB-A ports alongside a USB-C port, and all three get 10Gbps bandwidth. I would have liked to see the USB-C connector at the front as that makes connecting external drives easier, but other than that, I don't have any problems with the port selection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xperaV7uGCk8XJCbgbcPaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS comes with 8GB of DDR5 non-ECC memory pre-installed, which takes up one of the two SO-DIMM slots available. You can switch out the memory modules and increase it to 64GB (32GB in each slot) should you wish to do so. There are two M.2 Gen 4 slots available as well, and they're easily accessible by sliding the left side panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgKtXeXfLD9fnX3ZpXBbZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each drive bay accommodates 22TB NAS HDDs, so the total addressable storage is 88TB without including the M.2 bays. If you are thinking of going this route, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-Enterprise-Internal-ST22000NT001/dp/B0B94NBBJH">22TB IronWolf Pro drives</a>; I use these in my main NAS, and they're terrific.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-real-world-testing"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Real-world testing</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KoaEGNupWGorxXfBfFMvXU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Powered by Intel's 10-core Alder Lake Core i5 1235U with integrated Iris Xe, there isn't any shortage of power here. If anything, the NAS is among the best of any 4-bay server I tested, and there have been plenty of standout products over the last two years. <br><br>There are no issues in daily use, and whether it's running a VM or managing an extensive Plex library, the NAS easily breezes through demanding tasks. It has hardware transcoding and effortlessly manages to transcode 4K videos, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gk8QogvhZ8Lypwh65KSZaU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, I didn't notice any problems with file transfers, with the NAS able to saturate the bandwidth of the IronWolf drives with relative ease. You'll ideally need to use M.2 drives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CQ2CHH">WD SN850X</a> to take full advantage of the 10GbE connectivity. <br><br>The TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, and you get native clients for most utilities, including media streaming, backing up data, and virtual machines. You get Docker containerization as well, so you can easily install just about any service you need if it isn't available as standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WMnLg77Qpov7X38XuspMNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue in this area is that the software tends to be buggy at times, and the mobile clients aren't anywhere as polished as other brands. While there is a Photos client, it doesn't have any of the advanced features you get with DiskStation models. <br><br>It's clear that TerraMaster still has some work to do with the software, but I will admit that TOS 6 is a step forward — it delivers a cleaner interface and has much better usability. There's also the fact that if you don't like the software, you can just install TrueNAS Scale on the NAS.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-the-alternatives"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-20.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8H4XG8zH74V5MubFfC3dx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two years after its release, the DiskStation DS923+ is still a great choice due to the software feature-set. It definitely lags behind in terms of the hardware — every other NAS I tested has better connectivity — but the rock-solid software utilities combined with the robust mobile clients make the DS923+ an enticing choice, and it does a great job as a Plex server.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-terramaster-f4-424-max-should-you-buy-it"><span>TerraMaster F4-424 Max: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU" name="TerraMaster F4-424 Max" alt="TerraMaster F4-424 Max NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcxA6b5i3NqbAHpscm7ygU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a powerful 4-bay server</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity as standard</li><li>You need hardware that will last a decade</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best software in this category</li><li>You need a great value</li></ul>
<p>Outside of a few software drawbacks, there isn't much to fault with the F4-424 Max. The hardware is clearly the main selling point, and the inclusion of dual 10GbE ports along with the powerful Intel chipset and upgradeable memory makes it a fantastic choice if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS</a>. <br><br>While the TOS 6 software is much better than previous iterations, it's still missing that final bit of polish, and if you don't like the pre-installed software, you can roll your own — and that's enticing in its own right. I'm going to install TrueNAS and write a feature talking about how it holds up against TOS 6, but the fact that you can do so is in itself a big deal. <br><br>The F4-424 Max doesn't quite have the same value-focused pricing as its predecessors, but the upgrades to the hardware and software extensibility make it a good overall choice nonetheless.</p>

<p><em><strong>A BUNCH of people have asked:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Does the Samsung Galaxy S25 support the WPC's Qi 2 specifications? Can I use MagSafe stuff with it? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Alternatively:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why doesn't the Galaxy S25 support Qi 2 without buying a special case from Samsung?</strong></em></p>
<p>It seems like everyone wanted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> to support Qi 2 with MagSafe so they can stick their new phone to things and charge it or do whatever else someone can come up with using magnets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">I've got good news, and I have bad news</a>.</p><p>First, I want to say that while Samsung makes some great products, the company can be terrible regarding messaging. My dad would say they could wreck a box of ball bearings.</p><p>That could be intentional, maybe to keep an air of mystery surrounding new products, or because we like to pretend leaked information will always be true.</p>
<p>In any case, the Galaxy S25 does support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/" target="_blank">Qi 2.1.0</a> (they insist the zero be added and is important) specifications, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23254">listed</a> by the Wireless Power Consortium, which includes:</p><p><strong>1. Fast charging: transmitters and receivers can handle up to 15 watts of power.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Qi transmitters can be operated using USB power.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Better foreign object detection.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Choice of a single coil, coil array, or moving coil transmitter.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Technical bits and pieces from previous versions.</strong></p><p>Notice what's missing from these specs? Anything having to do with magnets. That's because when the Qi2 standard was restructured for version 2.0, the Magnetic Power Profile (what you might think of as MagSafe) was separated and is now its own standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-navy-iceblue-mint-02" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbXvngxxSw7oAWHpToARUV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can use the S25 with any Qi 2.1.0 or older charger, and it will charge. It just won't stick to anything because it's not magnetic.</p><p>If you want support for the MPP you will have to buy a case that has the magnets in the right(ish) spot.</p><p>Yay, technology!</p>
<p>Why is it like this? Couldn't Samsung have just slapped the magnets inside the S25 and called it a day? This is just a scam to sell pricey Samsung cases, right?</p><p>Probably not. I'm sure Samsung is very happy to sell you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">phone accessories like cases</a>, but I think this time there is more to it all. This was the easy way to try and give everyone what they wanted without reinventing the "guts" of the current Galaxy S series.</p><p>Qi2 with the MPP is a mostly open standard (meaning any company can license it and use it to build stuff), but it is based on something Apple first started doing. It's great that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23538131/qi2-wireless-charging-apple-samsung">Apple gave something like this away,</a> and I'm not complaining, but it means the phone was designed first, and the magnetic latching system was built around it.</p><p>Engineers at Apple put magnets and a receiver coil inside the iPhone where they would fit in the correct configuration and not interfere with any other components. Everything works great because it was all designed to work together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ciTqDSkHMn8NkXmfZSQ8ZZ" name="magsafe-iphone-14-pro-max-pixel-7-pro-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-together.jpg" alt="Pixel 7 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and Galaxy Z Fold 4 together" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ciTqDSkHMn8NkXmfZSQ8ZZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Qi2 first came out, I predicted it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-will-stifle-innovation">destined to fail</a> because the magnet arrangement and power transmission were both part of the spec. It meant that if you wanted to use the Qi2 spec inside your next phone, you had to put the right magnets in the right places.</p><p>This was done so chargers would be universal; you could walk into Best Buy and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=qi+2+charger&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys">buy a Qi2 charger</a> and it would work on any phone. But it meant that most phone makers had to rework their phones so things would fit where they were required to fit. So, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a>, we never saw any flagship phones using Qi2 because no company wanted to go back to the drawing board for a phone that's been in development for several years.</p><p>Some companies will never adopt Qi2 because they have their own proprietary version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomis-new-30w-mi-charge-turbo-fastest-wireless-charging-standard-yet">fast wireless charging</a>. They might add magnets to it, but you won't be able to use their charger on any other brand of phone and get fast charging speeds. It might not work at all. A standard prevents this from happening, and they are generally a good thing.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 was reworked</a>, and the magnetic part became its own standard, it meant that companies would and could adopt better, safer charging specifications. That's a great thing — the changes you don't care about can make a big difference when it comes to efficiency and safety.</p>
<p>Did Samsung do all this on purpose to get you to buy a case? We reached out to Samsung for an official statement and asked if they could share why they chose not to include the MPP on the Galaxy S25. If and when they answer, we'll update this article and publish the statement in its entirety.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on Android Auto now centers the navigation arrow if you haven’t set a destination yet.</li><li>However, this tweak means that much of the map view around your car will be blocked by the destination box on smaller screens.</li><li>Luckily, the update still shifts the navigation arrow and driving route when a destination is set.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> runs on car screens of many sizes, and although it tries to take a one-size-fits-all approach, that doesn’t always work. As newer cars start shipping with much larger screens with different aspect ratios, Android Auto is occasionally updated to adapt. However, that isn’t always a good thing. Now, a slight tweak to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> view in Android Auto is causing some users to become frustrated, as documented in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen/?rdt=43625" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>.</p><p>Previously, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-android-3d-building-android-auto-sync">running Google Maps on Android Auto</a> without a destination set, the street a user is currently driving on — along with their navigation arrow — would appear off-centered. It was positioned toward the right, to make room for the destination box. The destination box is fairly large, and features the search bar plus a few suggested location. Paired with the settings and buttons to the left of it, the destination box eats into the viewable area of your map.</p><p>That’s where the off-centered street view came in handy. It ensured that the street you’re driving on could be viewed on the map even on small, squarish Android Auto screens. A new OTA update appears to have shifted the navigation arrow, denoting a user’s current position on the map, to the center. This makes it tricky to see what’s in front of you on the street being traveled.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1i905xk/google_maps_is_now_centered_on_the_screen">Google Maps is now centered on the screen</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto">r/AndroidAuto</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The good news is that the Android Auto update doesn’t seem to affect the view when a destination is set. While navigation is active, the navigation arrow and driving route are both shifted right so they are clearly visible. This makes it all the more puzzling why Google would change the user-interface for setting a destination, as Reddit users describe in the comments to the original post.</p><p>The shift only affects cars with smaller and square displays, as widescreen or larger screens have the room to keep the map view visible even while centered. Hiding or minimizing the search bar and suggestions list should help matters, but that’s now another thing Google Maps users on Android Auto have to worry about.</p><p>It’s possible that Google changes or reverts this update in a future one, as it has tweaked the position of the navigation arrow and destination box multiple times in the past. For now, it seems users will have to get used to the central placement of the navigation arrow.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Pebble brand has been dead for nearly a decade, but Google is allowing its devoted fans and former engineers to resurrect PebbleOS by making the code open-source.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">Google Open Source Blog</a> announced the news, sharing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/google/pebble">Github repository</a> for the PebbleOS source code. Although some "proprietary source code" was removed, anyone can take the remaining code and generate a new version of PebbleOS, with functionality like "notifications, media controls, fitness tracking, and support for custom apps and watchfaces" available.</p><p>Pebble watches have a beloved cult following that has persisted well after the company's 2016 sale to Fitbit — which Google acquired (along with Pebble's IP) a few years later. Our editor Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pebble-time-review">reviewed the Pebble Time</a> back in 2015, with a generally positive impression along with some dislikes of its unique design.</p><p>Now Pebble's former founder, Eric Migicovsky, has announced plans to bring back the Pebble brand, launching a new watch with "the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well."</p><p>On his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back">personal blog</a>, Migicovsky explains that he "asked friends at Google... if they could open source PebbleOS," and that "over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this."</p><p>Now that PebbleOS is officially open source, Migicovsky and his "small team" can launch a Pebble clone — even if they can't <em>call</em> the watch "Pebble." Google still owns the name, after all! Considering some Pebble watch owners <em>still</em> wear these watches all these years later, they'll no doubt be eager to see how this new version stands the test of time.</p>

<p>"Lessons were learned last time," Migicovsky admits in his blog post, referring to how he oversaw Pebble's massive popularity burst on Kickstarter, the company's overambitious growth, and its failure to grow to match costs, leading to the need to sell Pebble to Fitbit.</p><p>His 2024 blog post <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble">"Success and failure at Pebble"</a> runs through where things went wrong. He highlighted things like the "too damn big" bezel on the Pebble Time and how they "failed to reposition" Pebble beyond the "hacker" crowd to productivity and fitness users. But the main issue seemed to be a simple case of spending too much money before Pebble was ready to earn enough revenue back.</p><p>With this project, it seems that the new Pebble team plans to stick to its strengths, with a geeky, niche watch that'll appeal to a core group of power users — similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing phones</a> in that space — rather than using massive resources to try and compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> or Apple Watches.</p><p>Some of the key features of this hypothetical Pebble successor are, according to Migicovsky's post, a sunlight-readable e-paper screen, long battery life, physical buttons for functions like music controls, and a "hackable" OS that lets you create your own watch faces and apps.</p><p>We're curious to see what new features this team will focus on. Health and fitness tracking are the most obvious growth areas for smartwatches these days, but that might require more resources than this small team can reasonably create.</p><p>I myself wrote last year about how I wished that a watch company would bring back <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">Pebble smart straps</a>; that's more about hardware than source code, but given how Pebble took such a unique approach, it'll be fascinating to see what old ideas make it into the new version.</p><p>Of course, the Repebble team isn't the only group invested in reviving Pebble. There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html">Rebble community project</a>, which had been working on a RebbleOS replacement firmware and now have plans to use the PebbleOS source code within their new project. And any other group could shoot their shot at a Pebble-like watch if they want!</p><p>If you're interested in buying — or seeing more info about — Migicovskys mysterious new Pebble successor, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/signup"><strong>sign up</strong></a> on the site for email updates, with the promise to share "full details about the new watch and shipping timeline" and to "prioritize shipping to people on this list first."</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is rolling out a big update for its last-generation midranger, the OnePlus 12R.</li><li>The update includes the BeaconLink app, Touch to Share, and Android Security Bulletin patches for January 2025.</li><li>It’s starting to become available in batches for users in all markets, including India, Europe, and North America.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out a significant update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> that adds a new app, a new feature, and the January 2025 security patches, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1779149502209327113" target="_blank">post</a> on its community forum. The update, with build number OxygenOS 15.0.0.500, is now becoming available in batches in all markets, including India, Europe, and North America.</p><p>The highlight of this iteration of OxygenOS 15 is the addition of a BeaconLink app. It works like a walkie-talkie and allows to call others nearby even if they don’t have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. While other OnePlus and Oppo phones already received the feature with OxygenOS 15, the OnePlus 12R is just now gaining support. There are limitations, of course — not every device is supported and range is limited to 500m.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R receives another OxygenOS 15 favorite as part of this update, and that’s Touch to Share. It’s an AirDrop alternative for OnePlus phones that’ll make it easier to share photos, files, and more across devices. Files can be shared with Android phones, plus iPhones as well.</p>

<p>Aside from those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15 features</a>, the update includes security patches from the January 2025 revision of the Android Security Bulletin. As such, it’s recommended that OnePlus 12R users update as soon as the new version is available. OnePlus says the rollout will be limited at first, but will open up after a few days. With that in mind, you shouldn’t have to wait long for builds CPH2585_15.0.0.500 (India), CPH2609_15.0.0.500 (Europe/Global markets), or CPH2611_15.0.0.500 (North America) to appear for your device.</p><p>It’s important to note that the update is only available for OnePlus 12R phones already running OxygenOS 15. If you’re still on Android 14, you’ll first need to upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based OxygenOS 15 before this patch will appear.</p>

Much of that time has been spent getting everything set up, along with running a few benchmarks before settling in.</p><p>Once the benchmarks were completed, I started downloading and setting up apps, meaning the onslaught of notifications arrived. It wasn't long before the thought popped into my head that something about my notifications was <em>different</em>, and it wasn't just going from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Despite having notifications ping and vibrating the phone, I would pull it out of my pocket, and there would be nothing on the lock screen. It was like I was getting those annoying "phantom" notifications, but en masse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QbYE2UUZjtyPHPJuV62skK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-lockscreen-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbYE2UUZjtyPHPJuV62skK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing that I checked was to see if Notification Categories was enabled. This was something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I noticed with the Galaxy S24</a>, but it seems that Samsung listened to feedback and now has that turned off by default. Then I figured something might have been messed up when I started trying to customize the Lock Screen settings. Nope.</p><p>As it turns out, I'm not the only one who realized that something was "off" with notifications. If he weren't a Bills fan, and we weren't hundreds of miles apart, I'd probably try to give this individual a big ole' hug. Will Sattelberg, Phones Editor for Android Police, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-one-ui-7-lock-screen-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">published a piece</a> that solved all of my problems. While catching up on my RSS feeds, I also noticed that Ben Schoon, Senior Editor at 9to5Google, also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/23/samsung-one-ui-7-lock-screen-notification-changes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ran into the same issues</a> with his Galaxy S25 Ultra review unit.</p><p>So, what's actually going on with notifications?</p><p>For some reason, Samsung decided to change the "Default Lock Screen Notification Style." Traditionally, lock screen notifications would appear as a banner, making them easily identifiable without thinking twice. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, that's no longer the case, as the default option is set to "Icons," which does nothing more than show a tiny notification before throwing the app icon into your status bar.</p>

<p>It completely removes the ability to just glance down at your phone to read the notifications before determining whether it needs immediate action. Instead, many will unbox and set up their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>, only to potentially have the same frustrations.</p><p>However, this isn't something limited to just the Galaxy S25, as I also checked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> I have on hand that is running the One UI 7 beta. Sure enough, lock screen notifications are set to "Icons," meaning that you'll need to change this yourself if you actually want to see notifications when they arrive.</p>

<p>I understand Samsung's desire to try and clean up the lock screen in order to put more focus on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Bar</a>. However, it's not like you can even use the Now Bar on the lock screen to view any of your notifications. I'm not sure if this is something that Samsung is cooking up for a future One UI 7 update, but that would make a lot more sense.</p><p>Instead, relegating the app icons to the status bar just isn't the experience I would have expected. It might not be a problem if you only get a few notifications every day, but as soon as you end up with more than three or four notifications, everything breaks down.</p><p>Okay, so enough complaining. Thankfully, getting things back to "normal" is pretty easy:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Lock screen notifications</strong>.</p><p>4. Under <strong>Notification style</strong>, select <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.00%;"><img id="YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg" name="how-to-change-lock-screen-notifications-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="How to change lock screen notifications on Galaxy S25 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that's it! Now, when notifications arrive, you'll actually be able to read them without worrying about the icons in your status bar.</p><p>It's entirely possible that Samsung will release a "day one" software patch that's available as soon as you take the S25 out of the box. But I also wouldn't be surprised if Samsung just left things as they currently are, at least for the time being. However, I do think there will be quite a few people who take to Reddit and support forums wondering how in the heck they can get their notifications back. And if there's enough pushback, then perhaps Samsung will revert the changes with One UI 7.1 or something.</p><p>What I don't understand is why Samsung decided this would be the best way to handle notifications. Again, maybe it plans to integrate notifications into the Now Bar, and even if that's the case, then it should've waited until those changes were ready for prime time. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of an uncluttered lock screen, but I don't want these kinds of decisions being made for me.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now that we've wrapped up Samsung's slab phone launch, rumors are digging through the web to find some supposed foldable specs.</p><p>This time, a set of leaked Galaxy Z Flip 7 specifications were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-7/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), which purports the phone's cameras. According to the publication, a recent discovery suggests the clamshell will sport a 50MP primary lens. This is rumored to be shored up by a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, as well as a 10MP selfie camera.</p><p>The post speculates that any worthy improvements to the Flip 7's cameras could lie squarely with its software — and perhaps the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodies with that, but we have a few months until we know more officially.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these are some very early Galaxy Z Flip 7 camera leaks, they don't spur excitement as the setup is the exact same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">the Flip 6</a>. The device's 50MP primary lens featured a 1.8 aperture with Dual Pixel AF, and OIS (optical image stabilization). The ultrawide camera came in with a 2.2 aperture. So, while the primary lens is a bit better at handling low-light scenarios, perhaps we're looking at the same situation with the 2025 version.</p><p>Galaxy Z Flip 7 rumors have been light, with one notable rumor arriving late last year about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">potential display upgrade</a>. The device is rumored to grab a slightly larger 6.8-inch screen and a bigger 4-inch cover display. It goes without saying that a display that covers the Flip 7's cover — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> — would be nice, especially since Motorola's clamshell <em>has </em>a 4-inch cover screen. Samsung's 2024 model still sports the tab-like cutout for its dual camera lenses.</p><p>Elsewhere, the folks at GalaxyClub reiterated a rumor about a cheaper Galaxy Z Flip in 2025. Rumors about a cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-budget-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-tipped-to-feature-a-flagship-caliber-display">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> were made earlier in January, with speculations stating it could boast a display like the Flip 6. It also seems the device could sport the Exynos 2400e, the same chip inside the Galaxy S24 FE.</p><p>The Flip 7 alongside the Fold 7 is expected to debut later this summer (per usual) — and there might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">a Samsung tri-fold, too</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google’s next product launch this year could be the Pixel 9a, the mid-range phone, which is supposedly a toned version of the current Pixel 9 series. While several leaks have hinted at what to expect, the new leak reveals the storage options of the upcoming handset.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lgomyoqssc2a">Roland Quandt on BlueSky</a>, who shared that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> would launch with 128GB and 256GB storage options. It appears Google isn’t changing or adding storage options for its A-series lineup, as previous iterations, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, which also arrived in the same storage variants across regions.</p><p>On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-pricing">Android Headlines</a> has shared that Google might introduce a price hike to the larger 256GB storage option of the Pixel 9a. The device would cost $599 for the 256GB, a slight price bump from the previous iteration, which cost $559. However, the publication indicates that the Pixel 9a could still start at $499 as before for the base 128GB model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:313px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:191.69%;"><img id="rM4FXH4GeEQhgdVohnLpjC" name="Pixel-9a-new-render-leak-01" alt="Pixel 9a render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rM4FXH4GeEQhgdVohnLpjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="313" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lgoqc73hzs2x">BlueSky post</a>, Quandt shared an image of the Pixel 9a from the front. Per the wallpaper, tipster notes that it could be the official render — although taken from a third-party phone accessories maker, which does reveal the front pane of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a>.</p><p>Although skeptical of this image into consideration, it still looks familiar to the Pixel 8a with rounded corners and the conventional punch-hole camera. While it also corroborates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">leaked renders</a>, the major difference that one could expect from the Pixel 9a, in terms of design, should be at the back.</p>
<p>It looks like Google might be bringing the signature camera bar at the back, which is quite popular amongst the flagship Pixel series. The leak suggests that the 9a will have dual cameras set up at the back, which appear completely flushed in towards the rear panel. These cameras are said to be a 48MP GN8 Quad Dual Pixel main camera accompanied by a 13MP secondary camera, and on the front, there could be another 13MP selfie shooter.</p><p>Also, the latest storage variant leak from Quandt corroborates with the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">detailed spec leak</a>, which further shared the same storage options next to the 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The same leak shared the device’s chipset, which is Google's Tensor G4 coupled with Titan M2 security processor. It will also feature a 6.3-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and the device’s color options comprise Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony.</p><p>The Pixel 9a, like its flagship counterparts, will likely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> along with the promise of seven-year OS updates, next to security and feature drops, which is a notable promise irrespective of being a mid-range phone.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tough being a middle child, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has risen to the challenge with a powerful blend of impressive specs, sophisticated design, and all of the AI-powered software features you could ever need. As we detail in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">our hands-on review</a>, the S25 Plus is all about refinement, improving upon its predecessor in a few key areas without raising the price. </p><p>You still get 12GB of RAM and a lovely 6.7-inch 120Hz display as standard, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is a huge leap forward when it comes to performance. The Galaxy AI features and One UI 7 are also present straight out of the box, plus you get great battery life and, of course, Samsung&apos;s seven-year software promise. </p><p>Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">Galaxy S25 Plus to the S24 Plus</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the new model didn&apos;t receive any significant boost to its camera tech, and the changing speeds aren&apos;t exactly breaking any records. But if you have an old phone lying around and you&apos;re looking to upgrade, use Samsung&apos;s trade-in tool to see how much you can save. It costs nothing to check, and you might end up with a fantastic 2025 smartphone for next to nothing. </p>

<hr>
<p>Amidst the Samsung Unpacked chaos, one of the company's execs might've teased a strong future where we see a long-awaited health feature on a watch.</p><p>Samsung held a Health Forum in San Jose the day after Unpacked, where its senior vice president Hon Pak spoke about an old rumor: non-invasion glucose monitoring. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-glucose-monitoring-3519742/">Android Authority</a>, Pak informed those at the forum that the company was working on a new "noninvasive optically-based continuous" glucose monitoring.</p><p>While this is likely technology designed for a future Galaxy Watch, Hon Pak declined to say anything further.</p><p>He stated that while the feature is "exciting," he's unable to explicitly state when it could launch — or with which product.</p><p>However, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/could-samsungs-galaxy-watch-8-finally-introduce-blood-glucose-monitoring">Tom's Guide</a> noticed the company published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-harnessing-the-power-of-ai-a-sneak-peek-into-how-samsung-is-turning-complexity-to-comprehension">an editorial</a> written by Hon Pak about the chase of non-invasive blood sugar monitoring. The post offers more details, stating that this optically-based feature will be joined by a newly developed "sensor algorithm." This algorithm is said to predict "early signs of diabetes" for users.</p><p>Pak's post also highlights the potential for a continuous integrated nutrition coaching feature <em>alongside </em>the basic monitoring functions Samsung is working on.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is leaning heavily on its AI software to help with the heavy lifting regarding its blood sugar monitoring and several other features. That's no surprise considering how heavily it's leaned into the "AI Phone" moniker, made obvious with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>. For now, speculation from our sister-site states this feature <em>could </em>debut with the Galaxy Watch 8, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Hon Pak seems confident in the research and development progress behind this, as he states that, once it arrives, it "will be a game-changer" so long as "we do it right."</p>

<p>There's been talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-explores-non-invasive-glucose-monitor">potential blood sugar monitoring</a> on a Galaxy Watch for a while now. What's remained consistent in the talks is the fact that Samsung is working on a non-invasive method so users wouldn't have to poke themselves with a needle. Samsung's Hon Pak stated during an interview early last year that the company is "putting significant investment toward that" — "that" being glucose monitoring.</p><p>Curiously, Apple has discussed bringing such functionality to its smartwatch; however, nothing has happened as of yet. It seems that Samsung ramped up its development and research of the feature as a result.</p><p>Hon Pak resurrected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">the topic last spring</a>, ahead of the Galaxy Watch 7 reveal later that summer. Diabetes and blood sugar monitoring were mentioned, as well as the possibility of adding in arrhythmia and hypertension for a future device. It was speculated at the time that a major hiccup in delivering this to consumers could be the regulatory factors down the road.</p><p>While this health feature was originally thought to be designed for the Galaxy Watch 7, we're now turning our attention to the Watch 8. Of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8#:~:text=We%20later%20heard%20via%20South%20Korean%20news%20site">we'd love to see it</a> — considering Samsung's been working on this for a while — but we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung January 2025 security update is rolling out now for a wide variety of Galaxy phones.</li><li>The patch includes 29 fixes from the Android Security Bulletin and 22 fixes specific to Galaxy phones.</li><li>You might have to wait for the update to appear on your device based on your carrier and region.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">January 2025 security update</a> has been slowly appearing on select Galaxy phones for about a week, but it’s now becoming available for a much longer list of devices. The patch brings fixes included in this month’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-security-bulletin">Android Security Bulletin</a>, and includes a total of 29 patched vulnerabilities and problems. As such, you’ll want to apply the Samsung January 2025 security patch as soon as it becomes available for your device.</p><p>Of the 29 vulnerabilities addressed in the Android Security Bulletin, there are five items with “critical” security levels. The rest have a “high” security level, and there were no “moderate” vulnerabilities in this month’s Android Security Bulletin. As usual, issues affecting non-Samsung devices were omitted, and Samsung addressed 22 of its own vulnerabilities to round out the January 2025 update.</p><p>The January 2025 patch has been appearing on certain phones dating back to last week, but we now have a full list of devices currently eligible to receive it (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/samsung-galaxy-january-2025-update-list/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>):</p>
<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S24</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S24+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20+</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy S20 FE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold SE</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A16</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A15</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A14</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A54</li><li>Samsung Galaxy A32</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Note 20</li><li>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s a lengthy list featuring the Galaxy S, Galaxy Z, Galaxy A, and Galaxy Note series. However, you should know that security patches are rolled out not only by device model, but also by carrier or region. If you’re not seeing the January 2025 security update appear on one of the phones listed above, this is probably why.</p><p>Notably, the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> isn’t listed here, and that’s because it hasn’t officially released yet. The Galaxy S25 lineup either will already include these patches in the One UI 7 build it ships with, or should have an update available when you get it. The rest of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">Samsung’s phones are still waiting for One UI 7</a> — only the beta program is available for the Galaxy S24 flagship lineup.</p><p>Per the norm, there are now new features appearing as part of the Samsung January 2025 patch. If you need help finding or installing the update, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-update-software-your-samsung-galaxy-phone" target="_blank">this guide has you covered</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Meta is starting the week with a new, more personal feature for its "Meta AI" chat feature in its apps.</p><p>Recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared an update with users within the Meta Channel on Instagram regarding a new update for Meta AI. As spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich, Zuckerberg states that the AI will now provide personalized answers based on "what preferences and information you've shared." It's likely the AI leverages things like places you like, spots you enjoy eating at, and the like.</p><p>As an example, Zuckerberg states Meta AI is able to create a fictional bedtime story that remains in theme with what his children enjoy: mermaids.</p><p>Zuckerberg states that his daughters "love mermaids" and a chat log snapshot shows that he's asked Meta AI to create a story like that before. However, asking the AI to create <em>another </em>story using "things my daughters love" delivers a response similar to history.</p>

<p>In a Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/building-toward-a-smarter-more-personalized-assistant/">newsroom post</a>, the company expanded on the new memory features for the AI that its CEO briefly highlighted in the Instagram channel. What Zuckerberg mentioned is likely the "greater level of personalization" detailed in this blog post. This capability is wrapped in the AI's memory function, as the AI will now deliver responses utilizing your "home location you’ve listed," Reels viewing history, and the fact that you may be married with a few kids.</p><p>Meta states its AI will use any shared, relevant information to offer an answer that <em>should </em>fit what you're looking for. This feature is rolling out today (Jan 27) on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>The post also reiterates the recent launch of Meta AI's "memory boost." Users can tell the AI specific things about themselves — like if they're vegan — and the AI will internalize it to reconfigure its future responses with that in mind. Memory boost is only functional in one-on-one chats with Meta AI and will not work in group chats.</p><p>It appears that this feature is rolling out more widely for users on Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Meta AI has slowly continued to deliver new features with a range of uses, like its ability <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">to "see" your pictures</a>. Sharing pictures with the AI provides a few editing options. Users can ask Meta AI to remove certain blemishes in a photo or they can ask it to alter anything about it using its generative AI tools. Moreover, taking a picture of food and submitting it to the AI can grant you its recipe if the AI can narrow it down.</p><p>A more fun update arrived via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">Imagine Me</a>," which lets users take a selfie, upload it to the AI, and let it turn them into anything they want.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Serious potential</strong></em></p><p>Samsung Project Moohan might be months away but it's got a huge amount of potential thanks to top-of-the-line hardware that likely features high-resolution OLED screens, top-notch cameras, a super sleek design with magnetically-removable light blockers, and the power of Android XR to back it all up. It's unproven and the price is unknown, but we expect to see more later this year.</p></p>

<p>Samsung Project Moohan made waves when Samsung announced it alongside Android XR, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">new and exciting version of Android</a> built specifically for XR devices like AR glasses, VR headsets, and mixed reality headsets. It's an upcoming mixed reality headset that will blend the virtual and real worlds into games and productivity, just like the Meta Quest 3.</p><p>Project Moohan, as it's currently known, will receive a final product name sometime later this year before the expected launch. Samsung showed off the hardware for the first time publicly at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a> during the Galaxy S25 unveiling.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan is said to sport higher-end hardware than the Meta Quest 3 and promises to be the best VR hardware to date, merging quality hardware with a more affordable price tag than the Apple Vision Pro. But does that mean it will be a better headset? Let's find out.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both Samsung Project Moohan and the Meta Quest 3 are mixed reality headsets, they each look and fit quite differently. The Meta Quest 3 is designed mostly to fit cost restraints so it can be under $500. That includes shipping with a relatively uncomfortable cloth strap for your head and an all-plastic design.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan has a far more premium look and feel, and while some parts are plastic to keep weight down, it looks a lot more like a Meta Quest Pro than a Meta Quest 3. This includes rigid side straps with a wheel on the back for quickly adjusting size, a large, plush pad for the back of your head, and another large plush pad for your forehead.</p><p>Unlike the Meta Quest 3, Project Moohan doesn't put any weight on your face at all. The rubber light blockers are magnetically removable — Samsung hasn't even shown off these parts of the headset yet — so you'll feel no pressure on your face while wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>You can swap out the Meta Quest 3's face pad, head strap, and more, ensuring it fits you perfectly.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3's default cloth strap distributes weight on your face and around the sides and back of your head. Some people, like me, find this to be uncomfortable and end up buying a third-party head strap along with several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> to make it more comfortable to wear.</p><p>While this sounds like a negative at first, Meta's "modular" design of the Quest 3 means you can take all the important parts off — the head strap, the face pad, etc — and replace them with ones you find more comfortable.</p><p>When I work while wearing a Quest 3, I tend to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/">Kiwi Design H4 Boost</a> head strap and I take the face pad off completely so the headset's weight isn't resting on my face. Otherwise, when I'm gaming with a Quest 3, I keep the face pad on to provide maximum immersion.</p><p>It's not clear yet if Project Moohan will be a modular headset. One of the biggest problems with the Meta Quest Pro was that its head strap and battery couldn't be easily removed, so you had to add things to the headset instead of easily replacing them with something more comfortable. We're hoping Samsung learned from Meta's design mistake on its Pro headset.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Project Moohan has automatic IPD adjustment, giving it an advantage over any other VR headset on the market.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung Project Moohan has automatic IPD adjustment thanks to its eye tracking capabilities which ensures that each user has the exact right eye distance calibration the moment they put the headset on. That's a huge advantage for Samsung over every other VR headset on the market which all require manual IPD adjustment.</p><p>Some headsets, like the PlayStation VR2, will help you choose the right IPD by using eye tracking to display an image you can line up. The Meta Quest 3, like most other VR headsets, requires you to know your IPD ahead of time. Adjusting it on a Quest 3 is easy and can be done via the IPD wheel on the underside of the headset, but you still need to know the right number before using it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gegYPxjSQ27fhj6xhC9MJj" name="Meta-Quest-3-hands-on-controller-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Meta Quest 3 Touch Plus controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gegYPxjSQ27fhj6xhC9MJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung's headset supports controllers but we haven't seen them yet.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 ships with two motion controllers — one is held in each hand — and also supports controller-free hand tracking for more effortless interactions. Each of these controllers features a joystick, three face buttons, a trigger, and a grip button.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan will also have controller and hand tracking support, but Samsung hasn't confirmed if the headset will ship with controllers included or if they'll be a separate purchase. Apple Vision Pro famously shipped with no controllers and no support for motion-tracked controllers. Apple later added support for controllers due to feedback, as they're simply required for some experiences and types of games.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multiple-windows" alt="Using a Meta Quest 3 with six windows open at once" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Multitasking on a Meta Quest 3 running Meta Horizon OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta Horizon OS, the operating system that powers Meta Quest Headsets, is built upon Android and always has been. Similarly, Android XR, which powers Samsung Project Moohan, is also a specific version of Android built for XR devices. While they sound similar on the surface, there are some significant key differences to consider.</p><p>While both are based on the Android Open Source Project, Meta Horizon OS features significant layers of customization that Meta has built over the past decade. Meta has built so much on top of Android that it actually packages it as a "separate" operating system, calling it Meta Horizon OS, and now offers it as an option for third-party companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">to build their own headsets on</a>.</p><p>Meta Horizon OS not only revolves around the "Meta Horizon experience," which includes promoting the Meta Horizon metaverse app front and center, but also ties Meta services deeply into the OS. Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram all have native Horizon OS apps, and while a few other apps can be downloaded on the app store, Meta Quest headsets are still mainly gaming consoles with some extra computing functionality.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest's operating system is built on Android but doesn't feature the Google Play Store. Android XR will.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Android XR is built upon the Android Open Source Project as well but, like most builds of Android, Google services are at the center. Android XR is said to be "the first version of Android built for the Gemini era" which means Google Gemini is able to operate the entire experience if you ask it to.</p><p>Google explained that Gemini can see what you see, including both the virtual and real world, and is able to answer questions and interact with virtual screens as you see fit. This could open up significant new design and interaction paradigms that we simply haven't seen before, but we'll need to wait until the full product launch to get a better idea of the actual functionality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multitasking-browser" alt="Multitasking between three browser windows on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Both operating systems are designed to enable multitasking in mixed reality, plus allow for full immersive apps and games.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Both operating systems support native multitasking, giving users the ability to open multiple windows at once and float them anywhere in real 3D space. You can think of these a bit like resizable virtual monitors that you can place anywhere, all of which are able to be interacted with like a smartphone or tablet interface.</p><p>Since Android XR has the Google Play Store built in, it's expected that Samsung Project Moohan will have substantially more 2D apps at launch than the Meta Quest ever has. Conversely, the Meta Quest sports thousands of games that will take time to convert over to Android XR. Meta funded several of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>, so it's not likely they'll see a release on an Android XR-powered headset.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how both operating systems compare, see our detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR vs Meta Horizon OS</a> comparison.</p>

<p>Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets power the Meta Quest 3 and Samsung Project Moohan, but Project Moohan features the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a>. This new chipset allows Samsung to include higher resolution cameras and displays on Project Moohan, all while sporting better overall performance.</p><p>Neither are "laptop-grade" chips like what's included in the Apple Vision Pro, but both chips are very capable and are roughly comparable in performance to a 2023 flagship smartphone with significant customizations to account for the extra processing needed for space tracking and motion tracking.</p><p>We know a some specs for Project Moohan but many technical specs, like amount of RAM, storage, and display resolution, are still unknown. It's said that Samsung Project Moohan features micro-OLED panels with up to 3,000 DPI resolution. The Meta Quest 3 uses LCD panels with roughly 1,200 DPI resolution.</p>

<p>Both headsets use pancake lenses, but Samsung Project Moohan builds eye tracking into the lenses. This will enable Samsung to have even better performance thanks to something called foveated rendering. This technology allows the headset to render the highest resolution at the center of your vision while saving processing power by lowering the resolution outside of that.</p><p>Meta supports fixed foveated rendering which attempts to recreate the same concept without eye tracking. While it is effective in enhancing performance, it creates lower resolution outside of the center of the lens and reduces visual quality in those areas.</p>

<p>Considering you cannot buy Samsung Project Moohan yet, this one's a bit of a no-brainer until then. The Meta Quest 3 is the best VR headset you can buy in terms of value and available software. It's got the most games of any VR headset and, since it's a standalone VR console, doesn't need a PC or external display to work. That's an amazing value for just $499.</p><p>Samsung Project Moohan will almost certainly sport better hardware than the Meta Quest 3 when it launches, but it's expected that Samsung will charge quite a bit more for its first Android XR-powered headset. Current rumors estimate the price to be around $999, although we'll need to wait until later in the year to actually find out.</p><p>If you're looking to get into XR today, though, the Meta Quest 3 is the right choice as it not only has a vast library of games and support for many streaming services, but it also supports native Windows desktop streaming for easy hookup to a PC.</p>

With the Google Pixel 9 series, there's a new option besides taking an awkward selfie, asking a stranger for help, or leaving someone out. Google introduced a feature called <strong>Add me</strong> with the Pixel 9, and it uses AI to merge two photos together, allowing everyone to be in the shot.</p><p>That might sound tricky, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-10-11-series-google-ai-camera-leaks">Pixel Camera app</a> offers detailed instructions and visual aids to help line up each photo just right. While there are some clues that Add Me photos aren't quite the real thing, they turn out pretty great considering the circumstances and allow everyone to be included. If you're eager to try Google's newest advanced camera feature, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> phone.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> is a quick way to take a group photo with everyone in the frame without having an extra photographer. The way it works is simple. Everyone will get together for a photo except one person, while leaving space for the photographer. After the first photographer takes a photo, they'll switch with someone else, filling in the empty space.</p><p>Then, the Pixel Camera app will guide the second photographer, helping them line up the shot in the exact same spot as the first photo. From there, Google's AI will merge the two photos together, making it look as if everyone was there at the same time. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, you'll see the Add Me version of the photo, plus an expanded version with the two separate shots.</p><p>Of course, since it's an AI feature, it won't always be perfect — be sure to check the results before settling on your Add Me image.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-add-me-on-the-pixel-9-series-2">How to use Add Me on the Pixel 9 series</h2>
<p>Using Add Me on the Google Pixel 9 series is quick and easy. In simple terms, you and another person will take two photos while switching places. After that, Google's AI software will merge the two pictures together, creating one seamless image. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Camera app</strong> on your Pixel 9 series device.</p><p>2. Swipe to the <strong>Add Me</strong> mode in the carousel.</p><p>3. Follow the on-screen prompts to learn how to use Add Me. Tap <strong>Don't show again</strong> if you don't want to see these prompts every time you use Add Me.</p><p>4. <strong>Take the first photo</strong>, while leaving space for yourself.</p><p>5. <strong>Hand off the phone to another person</strong>.</p><p>6. The next person will need to <strong>align the frame</strong> of the viewfinder with that of the first photo, and then capture it.</p>

<p>It's easy to see the situations where Add Me could really come in handy. We've all had times when someone was left out of a photo because there was no one available to take it. Instead of using a timer or taking an awkward selfie, Add Me on the Pixel 9 series can be a better option. It's easy enough that anyone can do it, and the Pixel Camera app guides you every step of the way.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has introduced a “New Galaxy Club” program for users interested in purchasing the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>Users who have purchased an S25 series device can opt for an additional subscription to help them upgrade their device next year.</li><li>The upgrade program is currently available in the U.S. region.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra launched globally, Samsung has a new upgrade program that allows users to upgrade to a new phone after twelve months.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/new-galaxy-club/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom">New Galaxy Club</a> early upgrade program is a fee that can be added to the price of your device. As detailed in a lengthy blog post, the subscription program lets trade their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> device after 12 months for the latest Galaxy and receive up to 50% off on their next device.</p><p>For the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S25 Plus, users who want to opt in for this club membership need to shell out an additional $8.33, while owners of the base Galaxy S25 pay $6.20.</p><p>This means that when you pay the subscription fees for the New Galaxy Club every month for twelve consecutive months, Samsung will give you the option to upgrade to a newer Galaxy flagship phone, which at that time will likely be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a>. It could give you up to 50% off of the phone based on what you paid for your Galaxy S25.</p><p>Let's say you want to get the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>; by paying the full $1299 MSRP upfront or within a relatively short period and opting in to be the New Galaxy Club member at $8.33/month, you will get $650 off on your next Galaxy flagship when you turn in the Ultra at the end of twelve months.</p><p>The other option is for Samsung to pay the remaining balance on the phone if you choose to pay via a 24-month installment. This means when it's time to upgrade, you'll be off the hook for the Galaxy S25 and can start putting money towards the Galaxy S26.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YuLZUzbWu8mbPuLeHhC6kX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-display-03" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the displays on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuLZUzbWu8mbPuLeHhC6kX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, New Galaxy Club enrollees will receive one year of Samsung Care Plus (without Theft and Loss) benefits, which is a plus.</p><p>Samsung account holders will also have easier access to the New Galaxy Club. However, it is not mandatory to have an account to subscribe to this program. This can track or cancel their subscriptions at their convenience without contacting Samsung customer support. The new upgrade program is available for consumers in the U.S. and can only be accessed through the Samsung website or the Shop Samsung app.</p>
<p>Users can choose to cancel their New Galaxy Club subscription at any time, but the past monthly fees will not be refunded in case of cancellation.</p><p>The New Galaxy Club program comes along with the other great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25 preorder deals</a> already available in the U.S. region and could help users get their hands on the latest and greatest at a cheaper price when the launch rolls around.</p>

<p><em>**Correction**: The previous version of this article stated that users can get the Galaxy S25 series at cheaper rates with the New Galaxy Club program.

<hr>
<p>A Samsung blog says Galaxy S25 Ultra users can buy a Bluetooth S Pen separately, suggesting the phone supports it. But oddly, Samsung’s own marketplace doesn't list a Bluetooth S Pen for the handset.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> flexes Samsung’s tech muscle with powerful AI features and Qualcomm’s latest chipset. It’s also impressively slim and lightweight, but that sleek design comes at a cost. The S Pen, a signature of the Ultra lineup, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">lost its Bluetooth functionality</a>, leaving out some advanced features fans love.</p><p>A Samsung Business Insights <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insights.samsung.com/2025/01/24/how-to-boost-productivity-with-the-s-pen-on-your-galaxy-s25-ultra/" target="_blank">blog</a> could be the light at the end of the tunnel, saying Galaxy S25 Ultra owners can buy a Bluetooth S Pen separately, as spotted by @WorkaholicDavid. Adding to this, some Amazon listings for the official S25 Ultra S Pen in certain regions also mention Bluetooth support.</p>

It's best to wait for an official statement from Samsung to get a clear answer.</p><p>It's possible that Samsung might have decided to sell a Bluetooth S Pen separately at a later stage, leading to inconsistencies in their own information. Another possible scenario is that Samsung's websites or retail partners may have included placeholder information or mistakenly listed Bluetooth support for the standard S Pen.</p>

<p>An upcoming update to the Google Sounds app might bring new haptic feedback options to Pixel devices, giving users more control over how their phone feels during different system events.</p><p>This information was brought to light by Android expert Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-sounds-custom-vibration-pattern-3507934/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> after obtaining an APK of Google Sounds version 3.2 via a tip provided by Nail Sadykov.</p><p>In version 3.2, the Ringtone Alert section has separate "Sounds" and "Vibrations" tabs. Android Authority’s screenshots show off 12 vibration patterns for ringtones and 11 more just for notifications.</p><p>For ringtones, these are the vibration patterns available:</p>
<ul><li>Synchronized</li><li>Classic Long Vibration</li><li>Bumps</li><li>Buzz</li><li>Rhythm</li><li>Swirl</li><li>Drumbeat</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Snare</li><li>Gentle wave</li><li>Heartbeat</li><li>Gears</li></ul>

<p>According to Android Authority, each vibration pattern has its own mix of intensity and duration, so you can really make your Pixel feel like yours. But it’s still up in the air if the Vibration & Haptics sliders will give you even more control.</p><p>On top of that, Rahman spotted some visual tweaks in the Sound & Vibration menu inside the device’s Settings.</p><p>In the Sound & Vibration menu, the "Phone ringtone" and "Default notification sound" options will get new names: "Ringtone alert" and "Notification alert." These will now sit right below the volume sliders for Calls, Ringtones, Notifications, and Alarms.</p><p>Google Sounds version 3.2, with its new vibration patterns for Pixel phones, isn't available yet. It hasn't hit the Play Store, and you can’t sideload it either at the moment.</p><p>Right now, there’s no clear timeline for when these new vibration patterns will roll out on Pixel devices. Some think they might drop with an upcoming update to Google Sounds or possibly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">next Android 16 beta</a>, which just made its debut a couple of days ago.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't changed much in terms of proportions, however, the corners are drastically different. Instead of the S24 Ultra's sharp corners, the S25 Ultra favors softer, rounded-out edges. This means you'll have to be extra careful when buying glass screen protectors for it, as glass protectors don't do well with curves generally. Luckily, there's a great selection of full-coverage screen protectors available for the device.</p><p>Whether you prioritize price, value, and quality, the amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra wins it all. You can easily install the included duo of 9H tempered glass on your phone using the assistive frame. Each glass protector is highly scratch-resistant and repels fingerprints, keeping it squeaky clean. The set also includes two camera lens protectors for good measure. The price is incredibly affordable, making this a home run.</p><p>If you want a case-friendly Galaxy S25 Uscreen protector, you could either opt for a plastic film like the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield HD Clear Film or stick with a glass option like the one from Spigen. And while you're at it, don't forget about grabbing a robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">case for your Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. We've got an informative guide to help you decide on an appropriate one for yourself.</p>

As someone with steadily worsening eyesight, I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">never liked using MIP displays</a> except during sunny workouts where they shine, so to speak. Indoors, COROS watches weren't that fun to use.</p><p>The PACE Pro felt inevitable and overdue after rivals like Garmin, Suunto, and Polar adopted AMOLED en masse in 2023 and 2024. I loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, calling it the best affordable watch of 2023, but only because MIP felt like a fair sacrifice for the price. The PACE Pro had a higher bar to clear, both for its $349 price tag and my expectations.</p><p>Since late October, I've taken the COROS PACE Pro on dozens of runs, hikes, and workouts, comparing it against other recent fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a>. I've come away impressed, or at least satisfied, with its accuracy and performance in key areas.</p><p>While it's taken me too long to get this review out, that's only a reflection of how jam-packed 2024 was with smartwatches to test, not its quality or importance. If you're on the hunt for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">reliable running watch</a>, I'd look seriously at the COROS PACE Pro.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-coros-pace-pro-models-and-specs"><span>COROS PACE Pro: Models and specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WAQ4ULqeVWecSfuLqpVqv8" name="COROS-PACE-Pro-black-and-white-models" alt="The Gray and Black COROS PACE Pro watches sitting on a blanket side-by-side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAQ4ULqeVWecSfuLqpVqv8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The COROS PACE Pro launched on October 31, 2024, for $349 / CA$499 / €399 / £349 / A$599. It currently ships in three colors — Black, Gray, and Blue — and only has one 46mm case / 1.3-inch display size. It defaults to a silicone strap that matches the case color, but you can buy a nylon strap for $29 that reduces the weight by 12g if you prefer.</p><p>The first "Pro" of the PACE lineup, it arrived about a year after the PACE 3 with some key upgrades. The most noticeable is the display boost from a 1.2-inch non-touch MIP to a 1.3-inch AMOLED touchscreen with an extra 120 pixels per inch and improved brightness.</p><p>Plus, you get an extra five days or 16 dual-band GPS hours of battery life, despite the switch to a more vivid screen.</p><p>You also receive 2X and 3X faster CPU and RAM, respectively, along with 3X faster wi-fi downloads and 32GB storage instead of 4GB (for maps and music). COROS adds new features to every watch that's <em>capable</em> of it; since the PACE Pro has the fastest processor yet, it's capable of performance-heavy features like mapping <em>and</em> should get years of post-launch updates.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: COROS contacted me during my review that "a small number of watches from the first production have a minor defect risk when exposed to incredibly dry and cold conditions. These conditions caused some watches to overheat and be uncomfortable to wear. This issue was resolved before PACE Pro went on sale and there is no risk that consumer units will have this issue. Only early samples were impacted."</p><p>I myself never had this issue, but I finished my review with the Black PACE Pro after starting with the Gray PACE Pro, which is currently disabled. Neither model had any noticeable differences in terms of accuracy or performance.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MntUfHhMGDNhCSps2sx5LL" name="Coros-pace-pro-display-closeup" alt="Burned calories and steps on the COROS PACE Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MntUfHhMGDNhCSps2sx5LL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reviewing COROS watches can feel a bit repetitive because each model builds upon the other. The features I liked in the 2021 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/coros-pace-2-review">PACE 2</a>, 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a>, and 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-announced-with-46-day-battery">VERTIX 2S</a> mostly apply to the PACE Pro, even though the VERTIX costs twice as much.</p><p>Generally speaking, COROS watches are lightweight, long-lived, and simple to navigate through the core widgets using the crown (or "digital dial"). COROS doesn't lock features to pricier or newer models, so everything the PACE Pro tracks is already available on the other watches (unless their processors are too old to support them).</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Using the PACE 3 software won't feel any different to 2022 APEX 2 owners; it's mainly the display, materials, and GPS that have changed.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That's why testing the PACE Pro is extremely familiar. COROS' EvoLab training metrics have remained largely unchanged. You see after every run how hard you worked out, how much of your activity splits into different heart rate zones, how long to rest before your next run, and other core data that runners need to succeed. Aside from a couple of missing features I'd love added, it's fairly comprehensive and only improving over time.</p><p>With just a few crown twists, you'll find your daily activity stats, training load and training status, recovery estimates, sleep stats, barometer, and other data; a few other useful widgets like race predictions and intensity distributions in the submenus by pressing the dial.</p><p>The UI isn't great for anyone who cares about apps, messaging, or a virtual assistant, but it is perfectly specialized for athletes who <em>don't</em> use their watches much outside of sports and checking notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5oxYT5JWSL4XotEthswdbL" name="Coros-pace-pro-training-load" alt="Training load data on the COROS PACE Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5oxYT5JWSL4XotEthswdbL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software can lag behind rival fitness brands for key features, but COROS has been on an update tear recently to catch up (even if COROS itself wouldn't frame it that way). And it makes the PACE Pro a more well-rounded device for athletes.</p><p>Just in 2024, we've seen COROS add daily stress tracking, wellness checks, sleep stages & quality, and nap detection. I think some equivalent to Garmin Body Battery or Fitbit Daily Readiness is the next logical step to this collective data, though COROS only has a Recovery widget for now. The PACE Pro is much better at knowing the state of your body rather than guessing based on your fitness level and workout intensity.</p><p>COROS also added niche fitness tools that made the PACE Pro and its siblings better specialized for serious athletes: real-time group tracking, gear tracking, safety alerts to emergency contacts, virtual pacing, cycling power modes, Strava Live Segments, and turn-by-turn alert arrows. The latter two make the PACE Pro more <em>useable</em> if you care about route navigation or tend to re-run the same routes and want to pace yourself in real-time.</p>

<p>What's most important to me is that the PACE Pro has downloadable maps that provide background info to your routes, while the $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> only has breadcrumb navigation — topo maps are restricted to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>.</p><p>COROS splits its map into grids, so it only takes a couple of minutes to download a particular region if, for instance, you're vacationing somewhere new or flying to a destination marathon. Creating a route in the COROS app is as simple as plopping down Start and End waypoints; power users can import GPX files or use partnered apps like Strava or Komoot to make routes, as well.</p><p>I rarely use map routes on any smartwatch, but I enjoy following them on the PACE Pro over any other brand for one simple reason: the crown. On my Fenix 8, I have to press the Up/Down buttons to zoom in and out, and it feels laggy and laborious; on my PACE Pro, it's as simple as scrolling the dial, and the speedy CPU makes the zoom-in or out feel effortless and quick. I jump from an eagle-eyed view to a close perspective in moments.</p><p>Maybe the map can pan and zoom so quickly because it lacks any street/trail names or points of interest, so there's no context for what's around you. COROS told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/coros-review-amoled.html#" target="_blank">DCR</a> that "trail/road labels are coming in Q1 2025" — another example of COROS' speedy update cadence paying off — and for now, that's the only negative to an otherwise positive map feature.</p>

<p>The core PACE Pro experience is lightweight and reasonably thin, uses only a fraction of its battery after an hour-long dual-frequency GPS run, and has a quick-release strap switch so you can buy and swap in any third-party option you prefer — though COROS' silicone and nylon replacements are very affordable at $29 apiece.</p><p>I like the default silicone band because of its breathable design and its two-slot buckle that keeps the watch securely in place, while other bands have some bounce during hard runs unless they're fastened tightly.</p><p>With AOD mode on, the PACE Pro is rated to last six days, though I never make it that long with daily workouts. Without AOD, it's rated to last 20 days; again, I found that estimate is a bit generous, but it still easily makes it a couple of weeks with sleep/stress tracking and regular GPS activities, which is a standard that'll keep 99% of runners happy enough.</p>

<p>Back in November, I did an in-depth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro fitness test</a> against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> for dual-band GPS accuracy and the Polar H10 for heart rate accuracy, including several long runs, a hike, and a track workout. Rather than repost 1,500 words and a dozen graphs here, I'll briefly quote my findings.</p><p>For location accuracy, "COROS' redesigned antenna and new GPS chipset paid off" with a "definite improvement in GPS accuracy" compared to past dual-band COROS watches that put it on par with Garmin's $1,100 flagship.</p><p>For heart rate accuracy, I didn't see a noticeable difference between the PACE Pro and PACE 3 despite getting a redesigned optical sensor. It's "generally reliable for heart rate" and better than your average running watch, but it did fall distinctly short during an anaerobic workout and was slightly too high on average over a long hike. I recommended "buying the COROS armband... if you need the best possible results," but found it good enough for most runners.</p><p>Since then, I've used the COROS PACE Pro for several more multi-watch runs, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-mile race wearing four watches</a>, to test more comprehensively how accurate it is. Here's what I found:</p>

<p>The two heart rate charts above show two more track workouts. The first is more of the same: the PACE Pro fell 2 bpm short of my chest strap's average because the watch couldn't keep up when my heart rate rose rapidly for 400m or 800m sets.</p><p>For my second workout, I did a sustained workout where I jogged in between hard 200m sets instead of pausing fully, and the results were much better. You can still see a distinct difference between the two, but the gap was smaller, and the rising and falling heart rates allowed the PACE Pro to balance out when it was too high or low. The HR average ended up being the same for both.</p>

<p>For a "normal" 13-mile run, the COROS PACE Pro did well enough, though there's always going to be a gap between a chest strap and an optical wrist-based monitor. Aside from a couple of heart rate spikes, the PACE Pro was generally a couple of beats behind the Polar H10, needing a little time to catch up.</p><p>It ultimately fell 1 bpm short of the H10's average. Still, an everyday runner will find the results more than good enough for accurate heart rate zones and training load.</p>

<p>I'm including a few more GPS screenshots with the COROS PACE Pro (<em>orange</em>) and Garmin Fenix 8 (<em>blue</em>) from that same 13-mile run, which ended with Garmin and COROS measuring 13.20 and 13.17 miles, respectively. As you'd expect from such similar results, the GPS maps are boringly similar, if imperfect. (<em>Click the box icon to zoom in</em>.)</p><p>Basically, Garmin and COROS tend to be parallel to or overlap one another in most places, but do occasionally drift a bit into the street. COROS' past dual-band watches didn't seem to do as well, but the PACE Pro seems fully reliable at this point and frequently beats Garmin's $1,100 watch.</p><p>You can count on the PACE Pro for reliable GPS results, and that's arguably more important than HR accuracy: Serious athletes can buy an external HRM if you need perfect results — such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a>, which syncs automatically with the PACE Pro — but they <em>can't</em> buy a satellite signal booster (as far as I know).</p>

<p>I'd personally choose a PACE Pro over a COROS APEX 2 because of the faster processor, dual-band GPS, 4x storage, and switch to AMOLED. However, some will appreciate the APEX's titanium case and sapphire glass, while the PACE Pro has a decidedly "sporty" appearance, which some might call cheap-looking. There's a reason why it did poorly in my recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>.</p><p>Whichever COROS watch you buy, you're not getting NFC for contactless payments. Rival fitness brands like Polar and Suunto share this issue; unlike Garmin, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LOGICMARK-INC-31299906/news/Garmin-International-Inc-completed-the-acquisition-of-FitPay-Inc-from-Nxt-ID-Inc-for-3-4-mill-34156278/">spent millions to acquire FitPay</a> in 2019, most smaller watch brands like COROS don't have access to NFC technology, which is a deal-breaker for some runners who want to leave their cards at home.</p><p>On a similar note, COROS doesn't have any major music partnerships, so if you care about music storage, you have to connect your watch to your computer and drag MP3 files into a folder. There are no playlists, and songs are organized by upload order. That makes the feature useless for those who don't have hard copies of their music and annoying for anyone who'd prefer customizability instead of one library of songs.</p>

<p>Having spent so much time testing Wear OS and Apple Watches in 2024, I do find the COROS UI fairly regressive. Having most of your apps, health sensors, and settings hidden behind a Back Button-long press, then having to scroll through your options one-by-one instead of swiping through an app drawer, is a pain.</p><p>Instead of being able to check notifications with a swipe from your home screen, you have to scroll through your widgets, select "Notifications," and then scroll through the lot. I've also found that emojis and photos don't seem to show up; COROS isn't taking full advantage of its AMOLED upgrade, in this case.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>COROS watches have missing or barebones features; some will be essential deal-breakers; others, you may not even notice.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The watch face selection is adequate, if not as widespread as you get with most other smartwatches. Aesthetics aside, my main problem is with the lack of complications: you can't customize the data you see on the watch faces; only tap the back button on the home screen to swap between a few pre-chosen metrics like heart rate, sunrise/sunset, and elevation. If I want to see my current training load, recovery time, or other stats without having to scroll through menus, I should be able to! And I should be able to tap & hold those complications to jump to the relevant graph.</p><p>Beyond these main frustrations, I'd love to see an equivalent to Garmin's daily suggested workouts rather than having to depend fully on long-term plans in the Training Hub. Pointing out whether I need more easy/medium/hard activity and how much training load I need (without overtraining) seems like something COROS could do. The same goes for audio prompts that tell you your mile time or announce your next workout interval through the speaker or your earbuds without having to look at your screen.</p>

<p>The main COROS PACE Pro rivals are the $449 Garmin Forerunner 265, $399 Polar Vantage M3, and $349 Suunto Race S. They're all mid-range, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">multisport smartwatches</a> with AMOLED displays, training load and recovery guidance, dual-band GPS, and at least a week of battery life per charge. Both Polar and Suunto have downloadable maps, too.</p><p>I'm accustomed to Garmin Forerunner watches, with access to Garmin Pay, Body Battery, daily suggested workouts, morning reports, audio prompts, ANT+ accessories, and a better selection of customizable watch faces. The PACE Pro has a significantly longer battery life than the Forerunner 265, plus ECG readings and downloadable maps instead of merely breadcrumb navigation. Both have 1.3-inch displays, but you can buy the 1.1-inch Forerunner 265S if you prefer a lighter experience. Whether you prefer a crown or Up/Down buttons for navigation during activities is subjective.</p><p>The Polar Vantage M3 will be my next review after the PACE Pro, but it had solid GPS accuracy and middling heart rate accuracy in my initial testing. I can't think of any obvious software advantages either COROS or Polar have over one another, but the PACE Pro has far superior battery life and display brightness, while the Vantage M3 has skin temperature readings, a display flashlight, and a wider array of useful performance and recovery tests.</p><p>Having only reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a>, I can't say personally how well the Race S would compare, except that it's the only other option with a crown if that's a main COROS perk for you, plus a classier stainless steel bezel. Its battery life is only a week per charge, and it has no music storage capabilities, but it has unique Suunto Apps that you can download onto the watch that add unique smarts.</p>

I'm giving the PACE Pro a lower score than the PACE 3 — or the same score as the APEX 2 — even though I'd wear the Pro over either watch without a second thought.</p><p>Even if it's an unfair comparison, the PACE Pro costs more than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, and so I have to weigh its shortcomings in areas like smarts and design on a stricter scale. And as I've reviewed a wider array of watches, it's made it clearer in hindsight how past COROS watches fell short in key health and fitness areas until they closed the gap last year. I'm stricter than I was in the past when I wasn't experienced enough to see what was missing.</p><p>What matters most is that the COROS PACE Pro is an excellent running watch, without a doubt. It delivers accurate GPS & HR results, as well as useful insights into my training load and recovery, with similar findings to other reliable brands. And you're no longer stuck with a dull, low-res MIP display in between workouts.</p><p>While the PACE Pro has its shortcomings, I'm genuinely excited to see how feature updates throughout 2025 will fix some of them. Otherwise, I'm hoping we'll see an APEX 3 soon that delivers the same accuracy and display boost paired with a more stylish titanium design.</p>

<p>Oppo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-could-be-half-the-thickness-of-an-iphone">hyping up the Find N5’s super-slim folded profile</a>, and a new leak gives us a closer look at its sleek design, hinting at what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> might also bring.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/24/oppo-find-n5s-new-images-give-glimpse-of-front-display-reduced-camera-bulge/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a> reports that supposed live shots of the Oppo Find N5 have surfaced courtesy of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/1750270991" target="_blank">Weibo user</a>. Earlier leaks hinted that the device could be under 9.2mm thick when folded.</p><p>That means the Find N5 may outdo the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> in slimness when unfolded, potentially coming in at less than 4.35mm.</p><p>The latest Oppo Find N5 images show the phone folded, highlighting a much subtler camera bump compared to the Find N3.</p><p>Nonetheless, you might have preferred the bigger bump on the Find N3. That said, the new design is definitely more stylish and will probably win you over.</p><p>Furthermore, the new images clearly confirm earlier reports that the Find N5 will feature a flat exterior display.</p><p>Reports suggest the Find N5 will sport a 2K display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It’s likely to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, with up to 16GB of RAM and a massive 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>The leaked images also give us a sneak peek at the Find N5's design, showing off a sleek frosted right-angle middle frame that feels premium. On the left edge, there’s the signature alert slider for easy notification control, while the right edge features the volume rocker and a power button, likely with a built-in fingerprint sensor.</p>

<p>The device features stereo speakers, with drivers placed on both the top and bottom. You can spot a microphone near the lower speaker grille. The bottom edge also has a USB-C port and a SIM card slot, though the slot is hidden by a digit in the leaked images.</p><p>With the OnePlus Open 2 expected to closely resemble the Oppo Find N5, these leaks could give us some solid hints about OnePlus' upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>The wait won’t be too long, though, as OnePlus is set to drop its device in the first quarter of 2025, right after Oppo’s Find N5 launch in February.</p>

It's not the first time this has happened; we've seen it in previous Galaxy phone launches, and even the "new" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-expect-from-android-and-wear-os-smartwatches-in-2025">Wear OS</a> seems completely like a Samsung/Google joint effort.

<p>I'm not talking about any sort of internet slap-fighting between overzealous but misguided brand loyalists. Samsung didn't sell bad displays to other companies or purposely sell exploding batteries to ruin the reputation of the Android ecosystem. Frankly, that kind of thinking shows a person has no idea how the smartphone industry even works, and I stay away from it all. OnePlus sold millions of phones and a handful of them using Samsung displays had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-makes-a-bold-move-to-tackle-green-line-issues-once-and-for-all">a green line</a>. Samsung sold millions of Note 7s, and 10 or so had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-makes-phone-battery-explode">critical battery issues</a>, prompting a recall. Nothing was intentional.</p><p>What I'm talking about and where much of the discussion about Android's ruined reputation stems from how closely the two companies seem to work together to give Samsung first access, or even exclusive access, to Google features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PzoeJ4N568nwXveMLaemT9" name="htc-one-m7-one-m8.jpg" alt="HTC One M7 and One M8 being held together" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzoeJ4N568nwXveMLaemT9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a change to how Android started. Having one company able to get Google software when other companies can't is a slap in the face of Android's "open" days. There was a time when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/10-things-know-about-motorola-droid-turbo">Motorola</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-htc-one-m7">HTC</a> were atop the Android mountain and Samsung would have been displeased if Google gave either exclusive access to features. Rightly so, thus I realize that to some people this change has ruined Android.</p><p>The thing is that Android was never really open and this isn't Samsung's doing. Blame Google if you need to point the finger.</p>
<p>The Google/Samsung relationship isn't equal, and that is Samsung's fault. Samsung depends on Google for the software that powers most of its mobile products and has given up trying to change that. Devices that ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bada_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Bada</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/theres-only-10-months-guaranteed-support-left-samsung-galaxy-watch-active">Tizen</a> were not good and had miserable sales numbers compared to any of Samsung's more recent Android-powered devices. They were Samsung's own, though, and I wish active development and products using them were still around. Competition is good, ya know?</p><p>Google seems to consider Samsung its own personal marketing division and product showcase department to me. Google didn't allow Samsung to have so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">Pixel-esque AI features</a> on the S25 because it wanted to help Samsung. It does it because it knows Samsung can sell hundreds of millions of phones every year, and it wants people to have access to these features so it can collect more data. As long as Google stays in control, it doesn't care that people think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is a Samsung product. It cares that more people are using it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google does this by having two different Androids. There is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">Android Open Source Project</a> that you or I can download and use on whatever device we like, making any changes we want as long as the open-source licenses are honored. Then there is the locked-down version of actual Android (yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines" target="_blank">the name itself is trademarked</a>) that Google controls with a tight grip. Licensing and platform access agreements mean if your company wants to sell a phone running Android with access to any of Google's software, you will toe their line.</p>
<p>This is the Android that Google uses like a carrot on a stick for device manufacturers. What Google does here is <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> distasteful to me, but it means companies like Samsung or OnePlus don't have to develop their own equivalent. Even though they probably could. If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-vs-amazon-fire-max-11">Amazon can do it</a>, Samsung can do it.</p><p>Samsung has grown dependent on Google. Some fragments show what Samsung <em>could</em> do, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. It seems likely Google forces Samsung to prevent the integration of Good Lock into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">OneUI</a>, saying it would create some software fork, and that means you have to go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-anyone-actually-use-galaxy-store-samsung-phones">Galaxy Store</a> and install it like an app.</p><p>Simply put, if you believe that Google and Samsung are working together to create exclusivity, you're probably right. It's a change from the Android of yesteryear, and you might think it's ruining things — some people dislike change.</p><p>Don't blame Samsung for it because it's 100% Google's doing.</p>

However, Samsung surprised many when it ended its presentation with a “One more thing” moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">teasing the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. Yet, while the teaser was a cool way to showcase the company’s engineering, Samsung managed to both intrigue and confuse me with this reveal.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge was rumored for some time as the Galaxy S25 “Slim,” with leaks pointing to a phone that was much thinner than its regular lineup of phones. Rumors seemed to go back and forth about the position of the phone and whether or not it would actually be revealed or launched alongside the regular S25 lineup. Now, we know the phone is a real, tangible device, but that’s about the extent of what we know aside from its real design.</p><p>What's confusing to me is Samsung’s decision to tease a phone that should have fully launched alongside the Galaxy S25 trio of phones.</p>

<p>I’ll start by saying I’m all for a thin phone. I recently wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-android-oems-can-improve-flip-phones">I wish flip phones like the Motorola Razr should be thinner</a>, so I wouldn’t mind returning to the days of the iPhone 6 when companies were seemingly racing to build the thinnest phone, of course, before being derailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/post-bendgate-world-apples-word-still-good-enough-most">Bendgate</a>. The Galaxy S25 Edge intrigues me because it could allow me to stick a case on the device without it becoming uncomfortably thick.</p><p>I know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">I’m not the only one who wants a thin phone</a>, so Samsung is clearly onto something here. The problem is that now, Samsung is making us wait.</p><p>On the one hand, I get why Samsung chose to tease the Galaxy S25 Edge now. Leaks are pretty much inevitable at this point, and companies like Google and Samsung like to try to get ahead of them if they can. Once the leaks get to a point of no return, they’ll try to get ahead of them one way or another. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-leaks-vs-google-and-android-leaks-how-are-they-different">Google has become good at this</a>, and now it’s Samsung’s turn to control the narrative by eschewing our expectations.</p><p>Early leaks referred to the phone as the Galaxy S25 “Slim,” which is clearly inaccurate, at least as far as the official moniker is concerned. It’s a slim phone, so the leaks were right about that, although we still don’t know how thin it is. Furthermore, some early renders of the device pointed to a triple camera setup, while the real deal only features two rear cameras. Another point for Samsung, I guess.</p>

<p>The main problem I have with this is that Samsung is forcing consumers to make a choice: buy what we have now or wait until this interesting new thing gets launched. As a regular consumer, I would be kind of pissed if I bought a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> now, only for Samsung to turn around and introduce something similar but potentially much more enticing mere months later.</p><p>This is a problem some had with Samsung’s launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-is-what-the-z-fold-6-should-have-been">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, a thinner version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> that launched months later ( and in the following quarter, mind you).</p><p>Shortly after the Z Fold 6 launch, Samsung was criticized for launching very iterative phones that didn’t seem to push the needle, to the point where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">issued a rare apology</a>. Then, a couple of months later, it revealed the Z Fold Special Edition, which had many of us intrigued. Unfortunately, it was only available in South Korea, and while it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">missed out on S Pen support</a>, it was still an impressive phone that felt like what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should have been.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-9.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max side view with power button and Camera Control" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JwFaqb8hAoHm2gLccGk9r5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After seeing what Samsung did with the Z Fold Special Edition launch, I can imagine the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-slim-galaxy-s25-might-be-samsungs-answer-to-apples-rumored-thin-iphone-17">waiting until Q2 to launch the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. This would give the company another flagship to put on the market in between the main S series phones and the Z lineup, which usually launch in Q3.</p><p>That would make the most sense, given how Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share">lost market share in Q2 2024</a>, revealing a sizeable hole in the company’s product release schedule. But while Samsung could risk losing some sales of its main trio of Galaxy S25 devices, it also gains something else that could be much more valuable in the long run: hype.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wpHpkdZeQD69aPrZrZdDNS" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-logo" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge logo on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpHpkdZeQD69aPrZrZdDNS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the company’s troubles in 2024, Samsung clearly needs something to show consumers that it’s still an exciting company. A “One more thing” moment à la Apple is the type of thing that could do just that, especially if Samsung shows off the phone while virtually saying nothing about it. It leaves us with more questions than answers and gets us all speculating about why Samsung clearly thinks this is a big deal. Because it has to be more than just how thin it is… right?</p><p>Maybe not. Apple has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apple-rumored-to-have-started-production-on-the-iphone-17-air">rumored to have an iPhone 17 Air</a> in the works, and the phone could bring us back to the days when thin was in. If Apple can bring great performance and battery life into a super thin smartphone, then it would be a pretty attractive package. And given Apple’s propensity to garner a lot of hype for its phones after they’re launched, Samsung clearly wanted to get ahead of the game and show us that it can be just as interesting as Apple.</p><p>The thing is, no one is asking Samsung to look at what Apple is doing because, frankly, Samsung's customers aren't looking at Apple. Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-could-be-very-different-for-google-and-samsung-heres-why">said as much in an interview</a> with Android Central editor-in-chief Shruti Shekar.</p><p>"For the longest time, Samsung has focused on competition with Apple when globally they’re competing with many more brands," he says. "To be successful, Samsung needs to realize that there’s more than just Apple. Samsung should leverage their scale to iterate faster and continue to invest in marketing like they used to do so during the pre-pandemic era."</p><p>Only time will tell if consumers will go with the hype. Of course, Samsung will have to prove that it can be interesting again, and I’m not sure 2025 is the year, especially seeing how its latest Galaxy S25 phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-just-not-excited-about-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">skipped over essential hardware upgrades</a> in favor of AI.</p>
<h2 id="all-this-for-this-2">All this... for this?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MFeaBDUciAB8jbdmGJhXNc" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-poster" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFeaBDUciAB8jbdmGJhXNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By choosing to wait and start garnering hype for the phone, Samsung also risks disappointing consumers with a fairly underwhelming phone. We don’t have official specs and information aside from what Samsung showed off at Unpacked, but leaks point to a pretty run-of-the-mill flagship that could come with some notable compromises.</p><p>The phone could run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-expands-snapdragon-8-elite-lineup-with-new-7-core-variant">a slightly underpowered version</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> with 12GB of RAM, which would help manage thermals in such a thin chassis. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-edge-certification-listing-spotted">Rumors and recent leaks</a> also point to a 3,900mAh battery with 25W charging. This would put its battery specs just beneath the smallest Galaxy S25, which sports a smaller display and a 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to have a display that falls somewhere around the Galaxy S25 Plus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">S25 Ultra</a>, and if true, it would be interesting to see how it handles battery life. One way could be that it lowers the resolution to just FHD+ instead of QHD+, which means it would miss out on certain display upgrades in the S25 Plus/Ultra, like ProScaler.</p><p>The only bright side of the rumors is that the phone could sport a 200MP primary camera, which so far has been exclusive to Samsung’s Ultra and Z Fold phones.</p><p>This puts the Galaxy S25 Edge in a very precarious position as far as where exactly it falls up in the S25 lineup, especially if it comes with the size of the larger phones with specs that fall more in line with the smallest, less capable model. Overall, it’s starting to sound somewhat underwhelming, which is exactly what Android Central’s Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">predicted would be the case</a>.</p><p>Samsung is trying to prove that it can be edgy again, but the Galaxy S25 Edge could fall flat, and generating all this hype for a potentially mid phone could backfire.</p>

The company states that its revenue had grown by 16% YoY (year over year), assisted by "19M paid net adds," and that it finished 2024 with about 302M subscribers. The company clearly stated that they "overperformed" this year, and it was pretty unexpected.</p><p>However, during their earnings call, the streaming giant stated that, despite their magical quarter, it looks like some bad news is coming our way. The company is reportedly gearing up to increase the price of its "most popular U.S. plan" by $2.50. The publication states the price of this plan — which could become the Standard Plan — will jump to $17.99 per month.</p><p>The price hike is set to hit U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Portugal. While we aren't sure why these specific areas were chosen to execute the increase in prices, it still remains to be seen when the *Tudum* bomb might drop on other regions as well.</p>

Now, the company has added a seventh location to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/magazine/locations?hl=en-US&pli=1" target="_blank">its Google Store page</a> — and it’s coming to Austin, Texas.</p><p>Not much information about the Texas retail store is known, as there aren’t even renders available at this point. However, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/24/google-store-austin-texas/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted, it is set to arrive in Domain Northside in Austin, which is a mixed-use development with shops, restaurants, office space, and more. The store’s address will be 11701 Domain Blvd, Austin, and all we know for sure is that it’s “coming soon.”</p><p>We’re still waiting on Google’s Santa Monica location to open, which was announced last year as Google’s second California location and sixth U.S. store. It joins the Mountain View, California store near Google’s own headquarters. Google opened stores in Massachusetts and Illinois in 2024, and looks poised to open at least two retail stores in 2025 as well.</p>

<p>Google Store retail locations are crucial to the company expanding its market share in the U.S., specifically through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel device lineup</a>. Its biggest competitors, Apple and Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-expanding-its-brick-and-mortar-repair-network-across-the-us">already have a significant amount of U.S. locations</a> where customers can learn about their products, buy them, and get repair and service help.</p><p>Put simply, Google is behind in this area and its current pace of adding at least two stores per year — especially ones outside of New York and California — is a big step in the right direction. The Austin location, when open, will make Texas the fifth state to have a Google Store.</p>

<ul><li>The Epic Games Store on mobile is inheriting a few fan-favorite features from the desktop version.</li><li>Epic’s free games program is coming to Android and iOS, starting with monthly drops.</li><li>Epic is still unsatisfied with Apple and Google’s sideloading policies, which it claims deters people from downloading the Epic Games Store.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">brought its popular Epic Games Store to Android</a> and iOS (in the European Union), and now the mobile version is gaining a few fan-favorite features from its desktop counterpart. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-on-mobile-adds-third-party-support">announced</a>the changes in an update today, Jan. 24, which include bringing the free games program to mobile. Initially, Epic Games Store users will get one free game per month, until the store starts offering weekly free games later this year.</p><p>Users can claim the first game, Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee, today through Feb. 20. Another game on the way is Bloons TD 6, according to Epic. These third-party titles join Epic’s own offerings, like Fortnite and Rocket League, which are already available on the mobile Epic Games Store. As Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-store-telefonica-device-preload-partnered">tries to build up its storefront</a> as a gaming-focused app marketplace competing with Apple and Google, it’s adding 17 third-party titles on Android and 15 on iOS.</p><p>The disparity is due to the restrictions put in place by Apple and Google, namely “scare screens’ and Apple’s core technology fee, Epic claims. That’s also why there are fewer than 20 third-party titles available through the Epic Games Store on mobile thus far.</p><p>“So far none of the 100 highest grossing mobile game developers are willing to distribute their games on the Epic Games Store because of the Core Technology Fee and Apple and Google’s onerous restrictions and scare screens,” the company claims in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/app-store-economy-is-far-from-open-despite-efforts-by-epic-developers-and-regulators-in-the-eu?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHWcDd4CPeDvT8zXqBVucW" name="Epic-Games-App-Store-Friction" alt="Epic thinks Google and Apple are creating too much friction when downloading the Epic Games Store on mobile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHWcDd4CPeDvT8zXqBVucW.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Epic thinks Google and Apple are creating too much friction when downloading the Epic Games Store on mobile. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Epic)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Epic also argues that more than half of the time a user tries to install the Epic Games Store on Android or iOS, they are deterred due to system prompts — which Epic describes as “scare screens.” The company says it takes 12 steps for a user to install the Epic Games Store on an Android phone. There have been 29 million installations of the Epic Games Store on mobile, short of Epic’s goal of 100 million by the end of 2024, according to the company. It alleges <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-harder-to-sideload-apps-on-android">Apple and Google’s added friction</a> is a key reason why.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for comment on Epic’s claims about friction and “scare screens” in the installation process for the Epic Games Store. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The situation isn’t all grim for the Epic Games Store. In addition to new mobile titles, Epic added persistent account login across games and auto-functionality on mobile. You can try out all these new features and games starting today.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series has the hardware to support satellite connectivity using Snapdragon Satellite.</li><li>However, Samsung didn’t make a deal with a satellite provider directly, so it’s up to your carrier.</li><li>Only Verizon customers can use a Galaxy S25 smartphone to ask for help in an emergency over satellite, at least for now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">powered by Qualcomm chips everywhere</a>, and that comes with an impressive feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-satellite-android-partners">Snapdragon Satellite</a>. Essentially, the Galaxy S25 series can connect to overhead satellites to transmit emergency SOS messages in an emergency — but there’s a big catch. Due to the intricacies of non-terrestrial network (NTN) satellites, only Verizon customers will be able to take advantage of the satellite connectivity feature. That’s why Samsung isn’t even advertising it.</p><p>The satellite connectivity situation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> was first uncovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/samsungs-failed-direct-to-device-strategy-s25-series-christian-5du8f/" target="_blank"><u>Christian Frhr. von der Ropp</u></a>, who is an independent satellite expert and consultant (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-verizon-satellite-sos-messaging-3519898/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Samsung chose to leave it up to the cellular carriers to make direct-to-device (D2D) satellite agreements with NTN service providers, rather than make an all-encompassing agreement itself.</p><p>This is a starkly different approach to providing D2D services than Samsung’s competitors, Apple and Google, have taken. Apple made waves when it partnered directly with Globalstar to provide Emergency SOS via Satellite for free to users of newer iPhone models. Google directly reached an agreement with Skylo, a 5G NTN, D2D service provider, for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> — meaning that users can utilize satellite services without involving their mobile network operators (MNOs).</p><p>As Frhr. von der Ropp reports, Samsung took a different strategy by stepping aside and letting MNOs — also known as cellular carriers — handle the agreements with satellite operators. The problem is that, per the report, Skylo is effectively the only 5G NTN, D2D service providers capable of supporting Snapdragon Satellite in the Galaxy S25 series. In other words, Skylo would have a lot of leverage in negotiations with cellular carriers who want to provide services to their customers.</p>

<p>That’s how we got to the point where Verizon is the only carrier to have reached a deal with Skylo for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>. It’s also an explanation for why the Galaxy S25 lineup supports D2D satellite connectivity, a hit feature, and Samsung isn’t touting it.</p><p>It’s possible that more carriers make deals in the future to enable satellite connectivity for their customers on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, or explore other options. T-Mobile, specifically, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-starlink-enable-satellite-texting-early-for-people-impacted-by-los-angeles-fires">partnered with SpaceX’s Starlink to deliver satellite service on Android phones</a>.</p><p>For now, only Verizon users can take advantage of the Samsung Galaxy S25’s satellite connectivity feature.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed an incoming update for the Pixel Watch Emergency SOS feature that adds a required confirmation by the user.</li><li>Instead of dialing automatically, the new default will require users to press and hold the display to confirm that they need help.</li><li>Google deployed a similar method to Android device's through the Personal Safety app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an Emergency SOS change to the Pixel Watch that might improve the experience for the user <em>and </em>the authorities.</p><p>The company detailed today (Jan 24) in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/320517148/emergency-sos-with-touch-and-hold-confirmation-on-pixel-watch">community post</a> that it's beginning to roll out an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-emergency-sos-pixel-watch">Emergency SOS</a> confirmation step to the Pixel Watch's safety feature. Google states the patch will make it "less likely to accidentally trigger" a call to emergency services on your wearable. Instead, the update will introduce a method that is still "fast and easy" for users to initiate a call to such personnel.</p><p>It's worth noting that change still requires your device to have location services enabled and a strong 4G LTE connection.</p><p>More importantly, Google says the Emergency SOS confirmation involves pressing the crown "five times" and holding down on the screen for "three seconds to start the call." If a user misses this confirmation chance, the company says your Pixel Watch will close the emergency screen (after 20 seconds) to avoid a mishap.</p><p>While this is set to become the new default SOS method, users still have the choice to allow their Pixel Watch to place an emergency call on its own.</p><p>Once this update arrives "over the next few weeks," users can navigate to their Pixel Watch <strong>Settings > Safety and Emergency > Emergency SOS > Ways to start SOS > Automatically</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:617px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:97.24%;"><img id="crnjoLahu6ibPeTsFh2m7C" name="google-pixel-watch-emergency-sos-confirmation-stage" alt="Google's Emergency SOS on the Pixel Watch will soon require a manual confirmation from users before calling emergency services." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/crnjoLahu6ibPeTsFh2m7C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="617" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This update to the Pixel Watch's Emergency SOS reminds us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-accidental-911-calls-fixed">of a similar update</a> Google dropped for Android devices. The Personal Safety app picked up an update that requires a "touch and hold" confirmation step <em>before </em>a user's phone can dial 911 services for assistance. The company reportedly implemented the step due to an influx of accidental calls.</p><p>Of course, the addition was seen as a proper mitigation method for Android but, like those phones, it could make it a little harder to get help when you need it, even on the Pixel Watch.</p><p>Google has been refining the Emergency SOS/safety features of its Pixel Watch, like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">new life-saving feature</a> from last summer. The Pixel Watch 3 gained the "Loss of Pulse" detection feature, which leans on its heart rate and AI software to detect if a user's heart has stopped. The watch is said to dial emergency services on its own with an audible message explaining to 911 what's gone wrong.</p>

This Wednesday, while I photographed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and other show-floor demos in San Jose, my mind was fixated on the 10% — specifically, the easily missed segment where they talked about Samsung Health.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> sounds powerful but very familiar. I just got a Pixel 9, and since Samsung will rely heavily on Gemini for its new phone, its innovations didn't feel fresh enough. And I know at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-just-not-excited-about-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">one of my colleagues agrees</a> about this!</p><p>More importantly, I'm a smartwatch guy, not a phone guy, and I have to wait another six months for the <em>next</em> Unpacked to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>. I had futile hopes for a glimpse of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a> or more info on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, and Samsung dashed them.</p><p>Thankfully, Dr. Praveen Raja, Samsung's VP Head of Digital Health, sated my wearables hunger when he came on stage to reveal the "new features" coming to Samsung Health in 2025.</p><p>Despite the lack of specifics, these features have me intrigued that the Watch 8 and Ring 2 will launch with much more exciting software than the last generation.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-has-a-unique-spin-on-training-load-2">Samsung has a unique spin on training load</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

<p>The first new Samsung Health feature unveiled on stage was "Vascular Load Indicator," a Labs (aka experimental) tool that monitors how your "daily activities impact your cardiovascular system," to help you "reduce strain on your heart and maintain long-term heart health."</p><p>"Load" is a familiar smartwatch term. Garmin watches and other fitness brands show your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> score after every workout, Google has its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a> to quantify both workouts and non-workouts for their level of exertion, and Apple Watches show a weekly training load graph relative to your past workout efforts.</p><p>I expected Samsung to do its own fitness-focused training load spinoff this year. Instead, vascular load seems to be a health-focused spin on the concept. Even if <em>I'm</em> more interested in fitness, I think that Samsung made a smart move to differentiate itself from its rivals and play to its health-tracking strengths.</p><p>Samsung hasn't yet explained how it'll track vascular health, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> already tracks resting heart rate, sleep quality, abnormally high/low heart rates, irregular heart rhythm, and daily stress.</p><p>If it takes all this data and adds workout data — judging if you're overtaxing your heart or being too sedentary and leaving it too idle — that could make for a useful, holistic heart health metric.</p>
<h2 id="an-unclear-samsung-health-coach-2">An unclear Samsung Health 'coach' </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eUYfpowhDhkAKQLNxxiXJA" name="samsung-unpacked-samsung-health" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eUYfpowhDhkAKQLNxxiXJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I perked up when Raja claimed that "Samsung Health will become your own personal health coach" before I realized that its definition of "coaching" was, again, less about fitness and more about data-driven health guidance.</p><p>Still, I can't help but be intrigued.</p><p>Samsung Health will let you choose a focus — sleep, weight loss, exercise, or overall health — and customize your home screen to match your goals, highlighting wellness tips like how your resting heart rate or activity levels compare to past days or weeks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="v4RtBTsvZCMjcASw7BTx9b" name="Samsung-Health-Coach-screen" alt="A Galaxy Unpacked slide showing a phone screen with the words "What do you want to focus on, Sam? Based on what you choose, we'll customize your Samsung Health Home screen to help you reach your goals," with "Overall Health," "Sleep," "Exercise," or "Healthy Weight" as the four options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4RtBTsvZCMjcASw7BTx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1949" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Samsung Health screenshot from Galaxy Unpacked 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, other fitness apps like Fitbit let you customize your widgets to highlight relevant data, and Samsung first announced wellness tips last year. So, this isn't what I'd call groundbreaking until I see more.</p><p>What's more compelling is Raja's mention of "AI tools" that'll let Samsung Health users "ask questions, get real-time insights, and receive personalized coaching as if you would from your own personal health assistant."</p><p>It sounds like Samsung intends to provide a health-themed LLM backed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> that incorporates your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> data or your doctor's recommendations to make things "personalized."</p><p>We've seen other fitness-themed chatbots like Amazfit's Zepp Coach AI, but they're usually generalized with no way to add context to your smartwatch data. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> does a pretty good job at this.</p><p>If Samsung actually pulls off a Health Coach AI, it <em>could</em> change the game for health apps in general with its specificity. It'll also mean Samsung will have to shoulder the responsibility of guiding people's health decisions, and not letting AI hallucinations or incorrect health sensors lead to poor advice.</p>
<h2 id="all-in-on-ai-health-2">All-in on AI health</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="xZAZYrvyGmsKYctbtEQgQR" name="Samsung-Health-antioxidant-index" alt="A photo of a Samsung phone showing the Samsung Health app showing the antioxidant index, next to a plate of healthy-looking food." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZAZYrvyGmsKYctbtEQgQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1949" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A screenshot of Galaxy Unpacked 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung also announced that it would use your nutrition log to track your beta-carotene levels and show an "antioxidant index" graph. This data will help Samsung provide "personalized nutrition advice" plus deliver "tailored meal plans and recipes."</p><p>Beyond nutritional health, Samsung Health will "monitor your mood" with a simple mood check-in, guiding you to meditation or breathing exercises if your mood suggests you'll benefit from this.</p><p>In both cases, Samsung is trying to make Health an all-in-one destination and beat out specialized meditation and nutrition apps like Calm or MyFitnessPal. That's much less interesting to me, but if an AI-personalized "tailored meal plan" could account for needing more of a specific vitamin or being allergic to something, that could certainly appeal to a wide range of people.</p><p>Samsung even mentioned during the subsequent smart home section that you could tell the Bixby AI to "Turn off the TV when I fall asleep" and have it do so using your Galaxy Watch biometrics. Of course, you'll probably need a Samsung phone, watch, <em>and</em> TV to pull this feature off, so it's only for superfans.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-unpacked-2025" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm not sure whether or not I can truly trust "AI" to guide my health or diet decisions. But if I'm going to trust any company on this front, it's Samsung. Its experience in the health sphere is pretty darn extensive. By the time Wear OS 6 and One UI 7 Watch arrive this summer, we'll all have the chance to test these tools for ourselves.</p><p>I will <em>continue</em> to demand more from Samsung on the fitness front since its vascular load data doesn't seem especially useful for athletes to judge if they're improving. Whether it be daily recommended workouts or a fitness AI coach to go with the health coach, Samsung has room to grow to keep up with fitness brands.</p><p>But despite Samsung only giving us scraps and vague promises, I'm still happy with how Galaxy Unpacked 2025 promised to make AI <em>useful</em> in real-life health scenarios, not merely helping you pretend you're a good photographer or generate silly AI art.</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge teaser that left us stunned, a recent discovery might clue us into what it's all about.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1882650534630584561">3C Certification database</a> listing was discovered by X tipster Abhishek Yadav, which details some crucial information regarding the phone's (potential) battery life (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-specs-leak/">Android Police</a>). According to the database, the assumed Galaxy S25 Edge features model number SM-9370. Aside from that, the listing clues us into its battery capacity, which is a lackluster 3,900mAh rating.</p><p>The tipster dug further and found that the S25 Edge could feature a measly 25W charging strength, too.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.🔋 3900mAh battery 🥴⚡ 25 watt charging 😵‍💫Via: 3C certification website #SamsungGalaxyS25Edge pic.twitter.com/be1XKQzEqm<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1882650534630584561">January 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Here's where things get interesting; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a">Galaxy S24 FE</a> was a 6.7-inch phone with a 4,700mAh battery <em>and </em>25W charging. This is kind of like a close model to compare as even the newer Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus feature 45W charging. What the database listing paints is a device with a sheer ~800mAh battery capacity drop compared to the latest FE model, which is already a slightly stripped-back variant of the 2024 flagship.</p><p>Recent rumors suggest the device — now believed to be the S25 Edge — could see the following measurements: 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>Compared to the S24 FE, it's a bit slimmer by roughly 1.6mm. The phone should also be slimmer than the recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> line up, too.</p><p>There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-geekbench-test">a recent specification leak </a>that told us a little more of what we might see. The S25 Edge could sport the Snapdragon 8 Elite alongside 12GB of RAM. The device could also feature Samsung's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP camera technology</a> to help keep its telephoto sensor thin, which fits with what the company is after.</p><p>So, while the idea of an even thinner phone is cool, we might see some sacrifices — kind of like the lackluster battery size and charging speed.</p><p>Samsung dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">major Galaxy S25 Edge teaser</a> during Unpacked, which could end up being the long-rumored S25 "Slim." Aside from some brief demo models shown off — that show a dual, protruding camera array — we don't have much else to go. The Korean OEM didn't get personal about its specifications, meaning we're still going to have to wait. Originally, the Slim was rumored to debut sometime in Q2 2025 and that could still ring true.</p>

<ul><li>The Oppo Find N5 is confirmed to have impressive water-resistance capabilities, as it is both IPX8 and IPX9 certified.</li><li>It’s possible that the Oppo Find N5 is rebadged as the OnePlus Open 2 in the U.S.</li><li>Unfortunately, there may be no dust-resistance certifications for the Find N5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The upcoming Oppo Find N5 foldable is already shaping up to be a hit, according to rumors, leaks, and early teasers. We recently learned that the Oppo Find N5, and likely the OnePlus Open 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-could-be-half-the-thickness-of-an-iphone">could be half the thickness of an iPhone when unfolded</a>. Now, an Oppo product manager has shared similarly-exciting news about the Find N5 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/PapUZDB5O?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-Oppo-demonstrates-industry-leading-water-resistance-of-upcoming-foldable-phone.949771.0.html" target="_blank">NotebookCheck</a>).</p><p>The company’s Find-series product manager, Zhou Yibao, shared that the Oppo Find N5 is set to have unprecedented water-resistance capabilities for a foldable.</p><p>“This time, the waterproof performance of OPPO Find N5 has been fully upgraded,” Yibao said in the post, translated to English. ”It should be the only folding flagship on the market that supports IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 full-level waterproof performance.”</p><p>This would match the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Oppo Find X8 series</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, both of which are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP68 and IP69 certified</a>. While the IP68 rating was once the gold standard for water-resistance, the IP69 rating takes that to the extreme. It specifically certifies protection against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">like the conditions of a dishwasher</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:90.58%;"><img id="53mPpydZB9mXnjwHzjdUXb" name="Oppo Find N5" alt="Oppo Find N5 side by side with an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/53mPpydZB9mXnjwHzjdUXb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="625" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Oppo Find N5’s thinness compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Zhou Yibao / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a reminder, the first number in an IP rating represents its dust-resistance capabilities. Unlike the OnePlus 13 and Oppo Find X8, the Find N5 and OnePlus Open 2 are only confirmed to have an IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 rating. That means there could be no official dust-resistance certification for Oppo’s upcoming foldables.</p><p>That could be disappointing to some, as dust can be more dangerous for foldables than liquids. The hinge contains moving parts, and dust or debris getting inside the hinge or under the foldable display can be fatal. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> has an IP48 rating that gives it some level of protection against dust ingress.</p><p>Still, it’s nice to see Oppo making waves with its next foldable. If the Oppo Find N5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> are impossibly thin and water-resistant, they could be incredibly successful in their respective markets.</p>

<p>Wear OS 6 should arrive first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, though Samsung's watch will use One UI 7 Watch and have unique features. We'll focus first on Google's mainline version of Wear OS 6.</p><p>An APK deep dive found evidence that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">Google will replace Assistant with Gemini on Wear OS watches</a> soon. We don't know if Gemini will arrive with Wear OS 6 or with the upcoming March 2025 update to Wear OS 5; Google hasn't updated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-rollout-resumes-for-all-pixel-watch-models-but-theres-a-caveat">November</a>, so it's possible they're pushing out a major AI update <em>before</em> OS 6.</p><p>Whenever it arrives, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini on Wear OS 6</a> will be a major shift, delivering a more intelligent assistant and more useful health and fitness insights.</p><p>Unlike Android phones with NPUs for on-device AI, smartwatches don't have the capacity for real AI nor the screen space for drawn-out LLM responses. The Pixel Watch 4 could have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon chip with faster performance</a>, but Google has to make Gemini compatible with the older watch models, too.</p><p>That's why Wear OS Gemini tools will require your phone to pass data back and forth over Bluetooth; still, we could get the equivalent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> using your watch's mic and speaker, only with a slightly longer delay than on your phone.</p><p>Otherwise, we assume Gemini on Wear OS will support extensions with other Google apps, so you can ask Gemini to read out a Gmail inbox summary or create a workout playlist in YouTube Music on the fly.</p><p>Beyond Gemini, we don't know what Wear OS 6 will support yet. Google typically reveals future Wear OS features in the spring around Google I/O, so we'll be sure to update this post then.</p>

<p>One UI 7 Watch, Samsung's version of Wear OS 6, already has a few confirmed features thanks to Galaxy Unpacked 2025, where Samsung's head of Digital Health, Dr. Praveen Raja, spent a few minutes on stage talking about Samsung Health features coming this year.</p><p>He described Vascular Load Indicator, a Samsung Health Labs feature that will track how your "daily activities impact your cardiovascular system" so you can "reduce strain on your heart and maintain long-term heart health."</p><p>Samsung Health Labs will also add an antioxidant index graph that will inform the Galaxy AI when making "personalized nutrition advice" and "tailored meal plans and recipes." These will presumably be available on your Galaxy Watch 8.</p>

<p>Most intriguing, Raja promised that Samsung Health will have an AI "Coach" that will let you "ask questions, get real-time insights, and receive personalized coaching as if you would from your own personal health assistant."</p><p>This coach may only be available on your phone, but a wrist-based version would certainly be useful for on-the-go insights!</p><p>Aside from these confirmed tools, we can assume that One UI 7 Watch will have other AI or health-focused features, just as One UI 6 Watch added an Energy Score, AI-based Wellness Tips, new gesture controls, and auto-suggested replies in Messages.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">first Pixel Watch</a> launched with Wear OS 3.5, so Wear OS 6 will be its final update if Google does support it.</p>

<p>OnePlus confirmed to us last year that its new Wear OS watches would receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-how-many-updates">two version updates</a> and three years of security patches. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> currently remain on Wear OS 4, we suspect they'll receive Wear OS 5 soon after the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-could-be-readying-a-watch-3-and-watch-3-pro-with-new-health-features">OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro</a> launch.</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus Watch 2</li><li>OnePlus Watch 2R</li></ul>
<p>Mobvoi doesn't guarantee updates, and its most recent models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch 5 Enduro</a> and TicWatch Atlas currently remain on Wear OS 4, with that update arriving in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-update-ticwatch-pro-5-series">September 2024</a>. It's <em>possible</em> these watches will receive Wear OS 6 eventually, but Wear OS 5 is the first priority; plus, TicWatches no longer support Google Assistant, so Gemini would be wasted on them.</p><p>The only other Wear OS brand worth mentioning is Xiaomi, which (like Mobvoi) is about a year behind Google and Samsung's updates. It's possible the Xiaomi Watch 2 and Watch 2 Pro will receive Wear OS 6, but not until 2026 at this current pace.</p>

<p>Aside from our predicted features above like on-wrist Gemini Live and Samsung training load, we have several features that we'd like to see on Wear OS 6 and/or One UI 7 Watch.</p><p>As I wrote in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-expect-from-android-and-wear-os-smartwatches-in-2025">Wear OS 2025 predictions column</a>, I want to see <strong>further battery life improvements</strong> with Wear OS 6. Google did a great job extending its current watches with XML watch faces and pushing more processes to the co-processor that uses less battery; I'd like to see them focus even more on efficiency and low-power idling with this next software update to make Android watches more long-lived.</p><p>Wear OS 6 should also <strong>make watch faces more exciting</strong> again. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">banned third-party watch faces</a> on Wear OS 5, which helped with battery life but made your visual options much more restricted and harder to find in the Play Store. I'd like to see Wear OS 6 bring back Facer as an official watch face store for XML faces, as well as a way to generate AI watch faces using Gemini.</p><p>Wear OS 5 made some major fitness updates with cardio load, running form analysis, and the ability to follow a target range like pace or heart rate for a workout. Wear OS 6 should continue this fitness focus: It could add <strong>downloadable and shareable courses in Google Maps</strong>, better <strong>syncing with accessories</strong> like HRMs or cycling power meters, and better non-running sports guidance like counting gym reps.</p><p>On the Gemini front, some kind of <strong>Gemini Coach</strong> LLM that gives you personalized health advice based on your nightly stats or judges your training load and walks you through future workouts would be a nice perk.</p><p>Lastly, I'm hoping Wear OS 6 brings us back to a <strong>regular update cadence</strong>. After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">messy Pixel Watch update rollback</a> and then a months-long wait for new features, it's clear that Google's ambitions for Wear OS sometimes exceed what it can squeeze onto watches at normal intervals. It'd be nice if Wear OS returned to monthly updates to match Pixel drops, and if Google implemented a <strong>Wear OS beta program</strong> to catch issues before stable rollouts.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Samsung Unpacked 2025</a>, we heard that the Galaxy S25 series phones have a "custom" (sort of) Qualcomm Snapdragon chip to power its features. That's pretty cool — we know Snapdragon chips perform well and we've seen what building an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">AI-tailored SoC</a> allows in Google's Pixel phones. The 3nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-elite-mobile-platform" target="_blank">Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> paired with a Samsung-spec NPU <em>should</em> work out well if Samsung can tame the heat it will generate.</p><p>But I'm going to guess that it was awfully expensive. Here's the rub — Samsung could have made that chip in its own chip foundry, built to its own specs, and tailored perfectly for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a>. Instead, it paid extra on top of Qualcomm's hefty prices.</p>
<p>I'm betting it will within the next five years. It doesn't make sense to continue to do things the way they were done for the S25 when there is a better and more profitable way. Unless Samsung stops making phones, I think the Galaxy S30 will have one hell of an Exynos SoC running the show.</p><p>The only possible hurdle is Qualcomm. Qualcomm will do anything to keep Samsung as a customer. Samsung may put Exynos chips in some of its products, but it ships a lot of phones, tablets, and watches with a Snapdragon something-or-other inside of them. That means a lot of money is moving from Samsung's pockets into Qualcomm's.</p><p>It's a good relationship for both sides, though. It's not like Qualcomm is ripping off Samsung or anything because it gets devices that work better than they would otherwise, especially in North America, which all companies cherish the most for some silly reason. Maybe it's because we're so willing to throw money at anyone or anything.</p><p>Qualcomm wouldn't have to lose Samsung as a customer and actually might make more profit another way — by licensing very specific things under very specific terms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uBVTaQHWjrkjwuDtJpjczK" name="samsung-galaxy-25-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-3nm" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBVTaQHWjrkjwuDtJpjczK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hypothetically, let's talk Galaxy S30 even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> just came out. The Galaxy S30, Galaxy S30 Plus, and Galaxy S30 Ultra could have a unique Exynos Ultra Elite 9000 chip that will never be in any other phone.</p><p>It would be made by Samsung with wireless connectivity options, core design, and maybe even GPU cores built using Qualcomm's design. Technically, it's possible: Samsung licenses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-arm-new-designs-mean-for-your-next-phone">ARM design</a> from ARM Holdings. It then licenses the changes to those designs that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-buying-nuvia-bigger-deal-than-you-think">Qualcomm has made</a> from Qualcomm. It can add its own suite of co-processors and NPU cores to build a unique, powerful chip.</p><p>Qualcomm doesn't have to worry about fabrication issues, foundry time, quality control, or shipping dates. It sits back and collects something like $0.11 from every single Galaxy S30 series phone sold just because it lets Samsung look at some computer files. Cha-ching.</p><p>On paper, it would look like a loss until you separate profit from income. Qualcomm spends no money letting Samsung do this, so every penny is profit. Qualcomm, like every other mega-corporation, loves the smell of profit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rdo7X4UBJu6wiCR7t52NRP" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 series in Galaxy S24 series cases" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 series in Galaxy S24 series cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdo7X4UBJu6wiCR7t52NRP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="1845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On Samsung's end, things smell just as profity. First, it doesn't have to pay extra for a Snapdragon SoC designed to integrate with any custom fabrications or additions it has. That's enough reason to want this. Samsung can also expand its own chip foundry business to meet demand, eventually becoming able to fab 3nm chips for other companies.</p><p>It wouldn't be able to sell these custom chips to anyone else or use them in products not covered under the hypothetical license. It probably wouldn't be able to because every S30 worldwide could ship with this new chip, and that's likely to be a bazillion phones.</p>
<p>I don't see any downside other than Qualcomm not being able to brag about all the chips it sells to Samsung or saying how it makes "the most advanced chip for the most advanced phone in the universe" or something equally silly. Qualcomm probably loves being able to do that, but I'll bet it loves making money without spending a penny to do it even more.</p><p>Let's do this. It's about time Samsung did something amazing again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Consumers haven't even gotten their pre-ordered Galaxy S25 devices yet, but one lucky user put the latest Ultra through a battery trial, and let's say it pulled through.</p><p>YouTuber, Benjamin Aboagye (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkzUHycf1Qc&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">Lover of Tech</a>), published a video, which pits the Galaxy S25 Ultra in a major test of battery charging strength. In the initial test, Aboagye placed the latest Ultra on a charger and discovered that the device could go from 0% to 70% charge in 30 minutes. It's worth noting that Samsung upgraded this year's high-tier device with 45W fast charging.</p><p>However, continuing the test showed that the device could reach maximum charge in just under an hour at 57 minutes.</p><p>Elsewhere, the tech enthusiast started a live stream where they placed several Android phones together for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlDv2e2gXSI&t=1s&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">a battery drain test</a>.</p><p>The stream ran for roughly eight hours. In that time, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which boasts a 5,000mAh battery, lasted seven hours and five minutes from full to empty. The test was riddled with different apps running videos and more to push the involved devices to the limit. Samsung's Ultra model ended the test in second place while the OnePlus 13 lasted the longest at seven hours and thirty-seven minutes.</p><p>Users can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlDv2e2gXSI&t=1s&ab_channel=LoverOfTech">full battery drain test</a> to see how an old and brand-new Galaxy S24 Ultra fair against two of the latest Android phones today.</p>

<p>Battery and charging are seemingly important this year as Samsung seeks not only to boost its longevity but also how quickly the user can get back to scrolling. During launch, Samsung estimated that its S25 Ultra could reach a 65% charge in roughly thirty minutes, but recent tests show that it's more like 70%. This is in contrast to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">the S24 Ultra</a>, which clocks a 60% charge in thirty minutes — 10% less.</p><p>Moreover, last year's Ultra is much slower in reaching maximum charge as the YouTuber's test highlights the hour and ten minutes needed for the predecessor.</p><p>What's curious though is that Samsung's 2024 model also contains a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging. So, while Samsung has likely worked some of its magic into the S25 Ultra, its custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is probably helping, too.</p><p>Android Central has published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-performance-and-specs">its hands-on</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The phone is loaded with Samsung's Galaxy AI enhancements, a new lock screen helper, and more of Google's AI model, Gemini. The latest Ultra is likely the most AI-driven device today with the many features that users can open up and experiment with if they desire. Some hardware changes seem to make a world of a difference for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as well.</p><p>The Ultra model would be nothing without its two other siblings: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, which sport similar designs to 2024, but with some next-gen bonuses to take us into the new year.</p>

Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, as well as Apple's iPhone 16/Pro and iPhone 16 Plus/Pro Max, are a few examples of smartphones that were identical aside from their screen sizes. Whether you wanted a big or small phone, you got the same overall experience.</p><p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series is here, it would be easy to think the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus would be a similar story. Instead, Samsung's first major launch of 2025 breaks the late 2024 trends.</p><p>Unfortunately, that isn't the case. There are three Galaxy S25 models available this year: the 6.2-inch Galaxy S25, the 6.7-inch Galaxy S25 Plus, and the 6.9-inch Galaxy S25 Ultra. At first glance, you might mistakenly think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus</a> are identical outside of their screen sizes, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra serving as a higher-end option.</p><p>The reality couldn't be more different. In many ways, the $999 Galaxy S25 Plus shares more in common with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">$1,299 Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> than the base $799 Galaxy S25. As such, you should know that you're sacrificing a lot more than screen real estate when you choose the Galaxy S25 over the higher-priced Samsung handsets.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xexavxLoiYvio8hnJzW9jh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-S25-Plus-display-holding-01" alt="Comparing the displays of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xexavxLoiYvio8hnJzW9jh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because the Galaxy S25 <em>does</em> share a lot with the other two Galaxy phones, it's easy to overlook its shortcomings. There's still a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset</a>, 12GB RAM, and the same exact camera system as the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus. But even though the things missing from the Galaxy S25 aren't obvious, they're just as important.</p><p>The differences start with the phones' displays, and it's more than just size separating these two devices. Yes, the Galaxy S25 is smaller than the Galaxy S25 Plus. On top of that, the screens have different resolutions, with the Galaxy S25 supporting Full HD+ and the Galaxy S25 Plus supporting Quad HD+. It's true that this may be less noticeable on the Galaxy S25's smaller display, but the larger phone's Quad HD Plus resolution means the Galaxy S25 Plus has double the pixels of the Galaxy S25.</p><p>All told the Galaxy S25 Plus should look crisper than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25</a>. Crucially, the bigger phone supports Samsung's "ProScaler for Quad HD+" technology. It's described as "AI image processing" that helps the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra "achieve a 40% improvement in image quality." So, it's clear the Galaxy S25 Plus will have a better display than the Galaxy S25 — not just the bigger one.</p><p>The base storage configuration is also lower on the Galaxy S25, as the phone starts with 128GB of storage. For an extra $60, you can upgrade it to 256GB (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">this is cheaper now, thanks to pre-order deals</a>). However, the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at 256GB. It's a nice perk, considering everything else you get when you make the jump to the middle Galaxy S25 phone.</p><p>One of those things is a bigger battery. The Galaxy S25 Plus has a 4,900mAh capacity, whereas the regular Galaxy S25 has a 4,000mAh battery. There are a few things to note here, though. For starters, the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus screen will draw more power, which means the Galaxy S25 Plus may perform similarly to the Galaxy S25 in the real world. But it's just as important to note that the Galaxy S25 Plus is way closer to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's 5,000mAh capacity, meaning it could shape up to be a battery life champion.</p><p>If raw capacity isn't enough to sway you, how about charging speeds? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">The base Galaxy S25 maxes out at 25W speeds over a cable</a>, whereas the Galaxy S25 Plus can charge at up to 45W speeds. For what it's worth, 15W wireless and 4.5W reverse wireless charging speeds are the same across both devices. With that being said, if you're in a pinch, you might wish you had those faster wired charging speeds on the Galaxy S25.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-UWB-01" alt="Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) support on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FJfzsJGzpmwkM8bxgNoYzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final advantage the Galaxy S25 Plus has over the base Galaxy S25 is the one I think could end up being the most crucial difference in the long run. The former has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">ultra-wideband (UWB) chip</a>, while the latter does not. For the uninitiated, UWB is a nearfield radio communication protocol that is excellent for data transfer and location, helping you find items with pinpoint accuracy. It's the technology that made AirTags so popular.</p><p>Well, the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement" target="_blank">Samsung SmartTag 2</a> also supports UWB for precision finding, as do select Tile trackers. It's possible that as Google's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device ecosystem</a> blossoms, more UWB devices will enter the fold. If your new flagship doesn't have UWB, it isn't future-proofed.</p><p>Considering that Samsung is touting the Galaxy S25 as potentially lasting seven years with full OS support, these hardware limitations could become a problem — one that you don't learn about until well after the return window has passed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A6BmrW892hgLCapb6cudu6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-displays-02" alt="Comparing the display size on the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A6BmrW892hgLCapb6cudu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To sum up, the Galaxy S25 Plus — despite looking like a bigger Galaxy S25 — has a few key advantages over its smaller counterpart. There's the higher-resolution screen, ProScaler AI enhancement tool, higher-capacity battery, larger base storage, faster charging speeds, and UWB chip. Like I said before, the Galaxy S25 Plus may be better viewed as a smaller Galaxy S25 Ultra than a bigger Galaxy S25.</p><p>I'm not exactly thrilled to tell you this. I don't want to say you <em>need</em> to pay $999 for the Galaxy S25 Plus instead of $799 for the Galaxy S25. In fact, I think it's commendable that Samsung has kept the base Galaxy S25 thin, compact, and light when the rest of the Android phone market keeps getting bigger.</p><p>I wish the Samsung Galaxy S25 had the same internal components and feature set as the larger Galaxy S25 Plus. Then, buyers could choose the one they like most and not feel pressured to size up. Unfortunately, as things currently stand, it feels hard to recommend the base Galaxy S25, considering how much more you get when you pay just $200 more for the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

<p>Leading up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, there were a few rumblings that Samsung might consider ditching the S Pen, likely in order to save itself a few bucks. Thankfully, those rumors weren't correct, and the S Pen is still alive and well with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>It's not just that we have a stowable stylus that makes the S25 Ultra intriguing even to those who don't want an almost 7-inch phone. The S Pen provided quite a bit more functionality than just being able to doodle on the screen. However, with the S25 Ultra, Samsung decided to drop Bluetooth Low Energy, opting for more of a "dumb" S Pen.</p><p>Caught in the line of fire with this decision was Air Actions. For the unaware, this would let you perform various tasks when holding down the button on the side of the S Pen itself. You could even customize the gestures and what they did, or just stick to the confines of the Air Action menu that appeared on screen.</p>

<p>For one, I'm still kind of in disbelief that the S Pen is even still around. Companies are always looking for ways to cut costs, and I presume this might be next on Samsung's list. At the same time, the S Pen does help the Galaxy S25 Ultra stand out for more than just its big screen or plethora of cameras.</p><p>Practically every other "big" phone out there forces you to use your digits as a stylus instead, but that doesn't always provide the precision interactions you might be looking for. This is where the S Pen comes in, as it's one of those "nice to have" features, at least whenever you remember that your phone has it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6wXCFouePCD2RdN245yYfL" name="Samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-burgundy-air-commands.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra burgundy colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wXCFouePCD2RdN245yYfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When attending a briefing about the S25 series, Samsung was asked why it would remove a feature that had become a staple. In response, company representatives stated it would improve durability, but that's not all.</p><p>As it turns out, the number of people who use Air Actions is shockingly low. Like, less than 1%. Oh, and it gets better. Of that, even fewer people actually use Air Actions, with the "the vast majority" of them only use it and the S Pen as a remote shutter.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Less than 1% of Galaxy S Ultra owners actually use Air Actions, with the majority of those only using it as a remote camera shutter.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In situations where the person with the Ultra also has either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ring-review">Ring </a>paired, those individuals rely on their wearables to double as a remote camera shutter. But what if the person has neither of those but needs the remote shutter functionality? Samsung explained to us that the "palm gesture" is the most common way that people rely on to take hands-free pictures.</p><p>To try and put the "less than 1%" in perspective, let's look at last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874802229586366801">it was reported</a> that between January and November 2024, Samsung sold 15.8 million Galaxy S24 Ultra units. Based on these numbers, 1% is just 158,000.</p><p>Since Samsung didn't provide the specific percentage, we'll just say that it was at 0.99% to avoid any speculation. So less than 158,000 people even used Air Actions, and an even smaller number only used Air Actions to take a hands-free picture. To Samsung, that's like trying to find a single grain of sand on the beach. So, the company found the grain of sand and got rid of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-microsd-card-5.jpg" alt="MicroSD card on the back of the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if you were to look around at the community response, you might think that this is as bad as when Samsung removed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-headphone-jack">headphone jack</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-made-a-microsd-card-that-doesnt-suck-but-theres-a-problem">microSD card</a> slot. Even if Samsung's numbers are somehow skewed, and more people used Air Actions than what we were told, it wasn't enough to make any kind of impact.</p><p>So, instead, there's outrage amongst the vocal minority despite Samsung having the data to back it up. Now, you could make the argument about why Samsung removed a feature that the overwhelming majority of people forget even exists. I wish I had an answer, but ultimately, Samsung no longer saw any benefit in keeping BLE in the S Pen, and now it's gone.</p><p>Usually, I'm one of the first people to grab a pitchfork when it comes to unnecessary feature removals or design changes. This time, I'm in the "Who cares?" camp. I couldn't really figure out why I didn't care until it dawned on me — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">S Pen Fold Edition</a> doesn't have Air Actions either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-22.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EmSigZ7prjRbed97djK7QZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps my opinion about the S25 Ultra's S Pen changes would be different if I had never used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold</a> before. So, for me, it will just be "more of the same" once the S25 Ultra lands on my doorstep.</p><p>One other thing that I want to point out is that Air Actions and Air Command are not the same. There seems to be a bit of confusion around this, with some thinking that Samsung removed the latter when that's not the case.</p><p>Air Commands is the menu that appears when you remove the S Pen and put a little bubble on your screen. Tapping said bubble opens a list of different actions, such as using Smart/AI Select, Screen Write, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK2PCADSS5tRefwmc4Wxtj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Air Actions are gestures that can be performed when pressing and holding the side button on the S Pen. These include being able to act as a remote camera shutter or even just interacting with your phone with a swish and flick.</p><p>Sure, I understand why someone might be upset if they relied on S Pen Air Actions all of the time. But it's impossible for Samsung to cater to every single person who buys a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>.</p><p>There's <em>always</em> the possibility that something will get changed or removed, and sometimes, it's something that doesn't make any sense. But other times, like now, there's no point in being "outraged" just for the sake of it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has wrapped up the Unpacked event this week with the launch of Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a sneak peek of the all-new Galaxy S25 Edge, which is expected to roll out sometime this year. The Galaxy S25 series is Qi2 Ready, and there is a new compatible charger already that has hit a recent certification.</p><p>A Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) website listing has indicated that a new 3-in-1 Qi2 charger suitable for the Galaxy S25 series has come in for certification (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/samsung-3-in-1-qi2-wireless-charger-galaxy-s25.html">Android Headlines</a>).</p>

<p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23430">certification</a>, the charger is manufactured by a company called WITS, which in 2019 acquired Samsung Electro-Mechanics’ wireless charging business. And, the company now has a 3-in-1 charger ready, which is believed to complement the latest Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>According to images from the WPC certification, the 3-in-1 Qi2 charger can wirelessly charge a Qi2-ready phone next to a Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring, respectively. Any Galaxy S25 model in the lot can be charged at 15W speeds, which is a significant bump from the 7.5W charging speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Samsung has also launched Qi2-compatible accessories for the Galaxy S25 models, including a magnetic case for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While many users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-tipped-to-have-qi2-wireless-charging-case">expected</a> the Galaxy S25 series to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 compatible by default</a>, the company has made them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2-ready instead</a>.</p><p>This makes the Galaxy S25 series still rely on cases that feature magnets even with the WITS 3-in-1 Qi2 wireless charger or the aforementioned Samsung official case for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Moreover, WITS also has a Qi2 wireless car charger for the Galaxy S25 models, which also offers 15W charging support. Users can also look for third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">Qi2-compatible cases</a> for the latest trio and even for the older flagship Galaxy models or compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> in general.</p>

<p>Samsung just launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> at its annual Galaxy Unpacked event. The phones come with all of the Galaxy AI features, and some phone upgrades. But most notable is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is now available at the same price as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Not increasing the price of its latest flagships is a move that I think might be favorable for Samsung.</p><p>The premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> starts at $1,299, the same price that the S24 Ultra launched at. At the time of the S24 Ultra launch, however, the price of the phone was increased by $100 from the Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p><p>During Android Central’s briefing for the S24, a Samsung representative said that the price increase for the S24 Ultra was because of upgrades to the phone itself.</p><p>“Over the last three years, we have added and improved Ultra dramatically and we have prided ourselves in providing an absolute best value that we can to our customers," the representative said.</p><p>"However, at this time with so much of the additions and improvements that were brought from additional improvements from chipsets to cameras, sensors and functions, it was just something that we’re unable to absorb this go around.”</p>

<p>I find it most impressive and interesting that this year Samsung was able to get a brand new, and much more powerful, chipset into the device and still didn’t have to increase the price of the phone. The entire series launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and more importantly is that it’s not just the Ultra that got the new chipset, but the entire lineup of devices, which includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus</a>. These phones also did not get a price increase.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, said that while it’s common that most manufacturers release new phones with new chips, it’s “quiet notable that Samsung isn’t raising prices.”</p><p>But at the same time he did indicate that in 2025, most manufacturers are likely not going to be raising prices.</p><p>“I don’t [think] we’ll see many price hikes this year from other vendors either because inflation is cooling and prices are quiet high anyway,” he said.</p><p>On the other hand, OnePlus recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which also runs on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset. The company raised the price of the phone to $899, and increase of $100 compared to the previous model, which was priced at $799, already undercutting its closest rivals. That said, it still costs less than the $999 Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

<p>The past year was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-could-be-very-different-for-google-and-samsung-heres-why">challenging year for Samsung</a>. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> had a successful launch, it didn’t really help improve the downard trajectory of Samsung’s sales. And in April of that year, the company initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create “a sense of crisis” among the company’s leadership team. <br><br>Where Samsung began to really struggle was after launching its Samsung Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, which in many tech circles were more iterative updates to what it launched the previous year. The phones weren’t super exciting and weren’t as innovative as they have been in previous years. It got the point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">Samsung had to apologize</a> for its lack of innovation last year.</p><p>IDC confirmed Samsung lost smartphone market share as of Q2 2024 compared to the previous year and that the company’s market share dipped to 18.4%, down from 20%.</p><p>And frankly, if Samsung wanted to have a better 2025, raising prices would not be the right move.</p><p>Ubrani agrees, but also adds, it probably won’t be a good look to shareholders either. “After a poor performance in 2024, raising prices would likely hurt them from a share perspective,” he said. “This is even more true in markets like Europe or Asia where there tends to be more brand diversity.”</p><p>IDC, in an email first-look report, indicated that the S24 series took up the increasing share of Samsung’s shipments during its launch quarter, adding that it contributed “to 22% of Samsung shipments in 1Q24.”</p><p>Because of its focus, IDC said that the company’s share in the worldwide premium market ultimately rose to as much as 20% in the past year, up from 15% in 2021.</p><p>Where the company has always shined is through their promotional activity and Ubrani notes that the foldable market will be a bit quiet allowing for the S series to win.</p><p>“Additionally, the market for foldable smartphones is expected to show some softness this year as the growth rate slows. This could potentially lead to increased promotional activity across Samsung’s S lineup particularly in the premium price brands later in the year which could also help the company sell more phones,” he said.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm glad, because Samsung did the right thing here by not raising prices. It’s a better look for the company and it is a better thing for customers. I think if customers are looking for new phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">they should seriously consider the latest phone</a> instead of choosing to buy an older model because of price hikes.</p><p>I look forward to seeing how Samsung improves this year.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S25 series introduces a new battery health feature, showing stats like health percentage, cycle count, and device manufacturing details in the settings.</li><li>The feature might not be available everywhere yet, with some regions still waiting for the update.</li><li>Before, checking battery health on Samsung was a hassle, but now it’s all right there in the settings for easy access.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google and Samsung leading the pack with longer software support for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, providing a clear picture of battery health for anyone hanging onto their phones for the long haul is now a big deal. That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/icymi-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-biggest-announcements-and-reveals">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series steps in with a new battery health feature, and some users are already seeing it in action.</p><p>X user @Razar_the_Raven spotted that all Galaxy S25 models now pack detailed battery stats in the settings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-tells-you-exactly-how-many-times-youve-charged-it/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). Under "Battery Information" in the Settings > Battery menu, you can check out your battery health percentage, cycle count, and even see when your device was made and first used.</p>

<p>While Apple has included battery information in iPhones for a while, Samsung is stepping it up with more detailed data and giving users more control over their battery management.</p><p>With more people holding onto their phones longer before upgrading, it’s now up to phone makers to provide useful info about battery life.</p><p>Before, checking your battery health on a Samsung phone was a bit of a hassle—you had to open the Samsung Members app, dig through <em>Support </em>> <em>Diagnostics</em>, and still couldn’t get a clear health percentage. But with the Galaxy S25, all that info is right in the settings, giving you a quick and easy way to check your battery’s condition.</p>

<p>Right now, it looks like full battery health information isn’t available everywhere. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-battery-health-charge-cycle-count/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, this feature might be limited by region.</p><p>It’s not clear why some Galaxy S25s are missing the feature. It might be that those phones need a firmware update to get it working, or maybe it’s meant to be exclusive to certain markets. Plus, it’s still unknown if older Galaxy devices will get the feature down the line.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series takes a big leap forward compared to its predecessor, thanks to the new Galaxy AI features. At the heart of this upgrade is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor, a powerhouse that’s ready to go head-to-head with Apple’s A18 Pro chip.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung S25 Ultra has a new and improved Corning Gorilla Armor 2 cover glass that can withstand life's unpredictable situations</li><li>The company claims that this glass has survived a 7.2-foot drop test and came back unscathed.</li><li>Gorilla Armor 2 has been engineered to resist damage and breakage better than the S24 Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>During the Galaxy S25 launch, Samsung announced that the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra sports a stronger Corning Gorilla Armor 2 screen that is said to provide excessive durability to its top-end model.</p><p>According to the company, this is the industry’s first scratch-resistant, anti-reflective glass ceramic cover that is debuting on the S25 Ultra. Corning claims that the glass can survive a 2.2-meter (about 7 feet) drop, even on rough surfaces.</p><p>Considering the hefty price tag this model comes with, users expect the phone to be extremely durable through life's wear and tear. Samsung says that this collaboration with Corning will give customers exactly that.</p><p>“Our partnership with Corning continues to push boundaries in display performance, ensuring that we meet the evolving needs of consumers worldwide,” said Kwangjin Bae, EVP and head of mechanical R&D at Samsung Electronics.</p><p>According to the blog post, devices that come with the Gorilla Armor 2 have better endurance when dropped on rough surfaces as the cover glass is engineered to resist damage and breakage better than the one on the S24 Ultra.</p><p>Lab tests also showed that the Armor 2  showcased four times more scratch resistance than lithium-aluminosilicate cover glasses.</p>

<p>Last year, the Gorilla Armor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> Corning set new standards of durability and visual clarity by enhancing surface reflections by 75% with the Corning Gorilla Armor in almost any environment. However, consumers have recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">complained</a> about how the anti-glare properties of the Corning glass didn't age well.</p><p>As users saw smudges on their screen had to be wiped down from time to time and sometimes it never went away. They complained about having to use an expensive screen guard since the device's anti-reflective coating was ineffective.</p><p>This time around Corning says that it has made "significant progress" and the Armor 2 is the most durable cover material ever used on a Galaxy device yet.  The cover glass claims to reduce surface reflections in both indoor and outdoor settings, without getting into the numbers. Likely, if you're out and about on a sunny day, your phone's screen may still be comfortably visible to you, with minimal glare from the surroundings.</p><p>"With Gorilla Armor 2, we offer consumers an unparalleled user experience with optically advanced and the most durable cover material ever used on a Galaxy device,” Bae added.</p><p>As for it being dirt and smudge-proof, we'll have to wait and see when we get our hands on the device. In the meantime, we already have roundups for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-screen-protectors">Galaxy S25 Ultra screen protectors</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">cases</a> for those that want extra protection for their $1299 smartphones.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan</a> teasers, there's a spotlight on extended-reality (XR) technology. It's fair to consider Meta a pioneer in this space, with the Meta Quest lineup, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and Meta Orion prototype XR glasses. Where is the company headed? Thanks to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-01-21/meta-hardware-plans-oakley-and-ar-like-glasses-apple-watch-and-airpods-rivals" target="_blank">report</a> from Bloomberg insider Mark Gurman, we have an idea.</p><p>Orion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">the prototype Android Central's own Nicholas Sutrich got to experience</a> last year, will never be mass produced. It's too expensive and has a separate puck that handles the wearable's processing. However, in many ways, it's a glimpse of what Meta hopes to offer to consumers in the future. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Meta just explained how the sEMG input works</a> — and why it may be the future of hand tracking and device input.</p><p>Gurman now reports that Orion will be offered to software developers next year, in 2026, so they can build and test apps for the platform. Even though Orion won't be sold, the company is working on another project — codenamed Artemis — that will be eventually sold. The Bloomberg report notes that it could become available as early as 2027. By giving Orion to developers early, Meta likely hopes to build up a software ecosystem <em>before </em>selling Artemis, avoiding an Apple Vision Pro-esque debacle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-03" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Artemis is likely still early in development, but Gurman says people with knowledge of the prototypes say it's both lighter and more advanced than Orion.</p><p>Separately, there's new information about Meta's future smart glasses plans. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses are a huge hit, and they're made possible by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-announces-long-term-essilorluxottica-eyewear-deal">a partnership with legacy eyeglass maker EssilorLuxottica</a>. But EssilorLuxottica manages many more brands than just Ray-Ban, and Meta may be about to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>There's reportedly a pair of Meta smart glasses in the works codenamed "Supernova 2," based on Oakley's Sphaera frames. This design would shift the camera to the center of the frames, and would be targeted at athletes, according to the report.</p>

<p>That might not sound great to uses of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">current Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>, who enjoy the subtle design and everyday wear of the existing pair. There is good news on that front, though: Meta is reportedly working on a premium variant of the Ray-Ban Metas codenamed "Hypernova." This set could cost as much as $1,000, per Gurman, and would be a high-end offering. Crucially, this pair of glasses would include a screen that turns the smart glasses into an AR device.</p><p>The most recent Bloomberg report indicates that Meta is pursuing an XR future on all fronts. It's both working on scaling down its Orion prototype for mass production, and scaling up its Ray-Ban Meta glasses to become a true AR device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly calling attention to a potentially dangerous situation regarding two of Fitbit's smartwatches.</p><p>Our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/fitbit-issues-battery-overheating-warning-over-two-of-its-most-popular-watches-and-it-might-compensate-you-if-youre-affected">TechRadar</a> hopped on this after receiving word from Google about a battery overheating problem affecting the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3. The company reportedly adds that a "limited" number of those devices and users may be affected.</p><p>In detailing the situation, a Google statement says this issue "poses a potential risk for users and requires an immediate firmware update."</p><p>The publication highlights the details of the update provided by Google. According to the post, the update for the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3 will improve the "stability" of the batteries while also "reducing the risk" of overheating. Unfortunately, tackling this through software seems to adversely affect the longevity of the batteries in both watches.</p><p>Google states that, as a result of the update, "the battery will last for shorter periods between charges."</p><p>The post states that users with these devices who require the update will be notified on two fronts: in the Fitbit app <em>and </em>via email from Google.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has created a form for this harmful battery discovery for affected users. Those with a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3 can fill out the information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/contact/fitbit_sense_and_versa_3_registration?visit_id=638731352243419808-3939466803&p=sense-versa3-help&rd=1">in this form</a> to "determine eligibility" for "an appeasement of $50 USD." If you require the update, it will be delivered, as well as the compensation money should your eligibility prove true.</p>

<p>Curiously, this isn't the first time Fitbit has had an issue with overheating batteries as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-is-recalling-over-1-million-ionic-smartwatches-heres-why">a similar problem</a> occurred with its old Ionic smartwatches. The company issued a recall of nearly one million of the watches due to the severe risk it posed to consumer safety. The company stated at the time that its batteries could overheat and (potentially) create a burn hazard when worn.</p><p>This led to a lawsuit, which was then shored up by <em>another </em>two months later in May 2022.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-hit-with-another-lawsuit">second lawsuit</a> claimed that Fitbit's trackers and watches were burning users' wrists due to overheating batteries. The devices detailed in this second lawsuit were the Fitbit Sense and the Versa — which is similar to what we're seeing crop up today. Users provided after images of the damage done to their skin because of the hotter-than-expected batteries against their body.</p><p>It seems like Google is trying to get well ahead of this issue, lest both sides suffer a repeat of 2022.</p>

No kidding. The only catch is that you&apos;re limited to trading in devices from Apple, Google, or Samsung (sorry, Motorola users). To sweeten the deal, Verizon will also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Tab S9 FE, which means you could be getting over $1,500 of free stuff when you preorder. </p>

<p>Just like its predecessor, the Galaxy S25 Plus is all about balance.
