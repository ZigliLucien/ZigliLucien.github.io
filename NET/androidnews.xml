<hr>
<p>Fairphone announces the launch of its "Fairbuds," which follow behind its smartphones in terms of user-reparability.</p><p>According to a press release, the Android and iOS-compatible earbuds are the smaller counterpart to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fairphone-fairbuds-xl-launch">Fairbuds XL</a> headphones from 2023. The new buds boast "premium" quality sound through the provided 11mm drivers. Fairphone adds users can enable active noise cancellation (ANC), which includes wind noise reduction, for a richer experience.</p><p>Additionally, the Fairbuds feature "crystal clear calling" for users indoors and outdoors, courtesy of its ENC (environmental noise canceling) functionality. Speaking of (no pun intended), the buds deliver six microphones in total so the device can capture every word. Moreover, the Fairbuds offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, giving users the ability to connect to two devices at once.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN" name="fairphone-fairbuds-black-example.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in its black colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bf6bssyrTMXk4WvfAwPYTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the new Fairbuds is a talking point as Fairphone states the device delivers a "modular design" full of user-replaceable parts. Its specifications sheet states the Fairbuds feature seven spare parts that users can grab if something goes wrong. The parts available include new earbuds, battery and silicon ring, earbud tips, charging case shell, case core, and the case&apos;s battery.</p><p>If something goes wrong, users in Europe can grab these spare parts on the Fairphone webshop.</p><p>The Fairbuds contain a 45mAh battery, while the charging case features a 500mAh battery capacity. Fairphone states its buds can last for six hours on a full charge, with an additional 20 hours housed inside the charging case. As a quick pick-me-up, the Fairbuds can gain 1.5 hours of playback time in 10 minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1165px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.50%;"><img id="SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ" name="fairphone-fairbuds-white-colorway-launch.jpg" alt="The Fairphone Fairbuds in a white colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuwVcC2uj4UkpHrPdCRchQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1165" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fairbuds have received an IP54 rating for sweat and water resistance. The press release states that the buds and cases were created with 70% recycled "fair materials." Software-wise, the company states that consumers can utilize their Fairbuds with Google Assistant and Apple&apos;s Siri for hands-free help.</p><p>Users in Europe looking for the Fairbuds will also receive a three-year warranty — which is a one-year extension of the brand&apos;s typical two-year plan.</p><p>Consumers across Europe can get their hands on Fairphone&apos;s latest Fairbuds for €149. The buds are available for pre-order beginning today (Apr. 9) on the Fairphone website and a few select European retailers. The company states the €149 price tag will vary from country to country in the region. Those interested will find the device in white and black colorways.</p>

<p>Bose Ultra Open earbuds went on sale on February 15, 2024, and are available in two colorways: Black and White Smoke. You can pick up a pair directly from Bose for $299 or from various retailers like Best Buy and Amazon for the same price. I’ve had them for a while now, and I don’t recall seeing this at launch, but on their website, you can also purchase them bundled with a wireless charging case cover <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bose.com/p/earbuds-earbuds-sets/SET-UOE-WLSCH.html">for an additional $48</a>, bringing the total cost to $348. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-what-s-good"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: What's good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQVNcUcMrwLWDssUehnAHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I won’t belabor the point since I made it in the verdict and intro, but aesthetically, I’m in love with this design. The fit and finish are premium down to how they’re seated into the case. With some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbuds</a>, you find yourself almost having to dig them out of their charging case, but the Bose Ultra kind of just sit on top of their seats in the case. Connected by strong magnets, when you hold them near, they snap into their seat. In front of their seats, you get bright LEDs that indicate the charging status of each earbud, which is in addition to the status LED on the front of the case.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A departure from traditional open-ear designs, they look as much like jewelry as they do consumer technology, so much so that I’m considering buying some earcuffs now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>No extra ear tips or wings with these as they are an ear cuff design with the speaker portion sitting inside the antitragus or antihelix, depending on how you position it. The battery is on the other end of the cuff and sits behind the ear. The fit is snug, but I’ve worn these for hours and only felt a bit of wear fatigue on my right ear, not my left.</p><p>At the gym, they don’t move at all! So you’re solid if you use these for dynamic HIIT workouts, and you don’t need to worry about sweat as they’re IPX4 water-resistant. Wearing them at my gym, I was surprised that the music from these wasn’t drowned out by the terrible selection playing on the house speakers.</p><p>As someone who spends a lot of time in the gym, I love the tactile buttons. They’re large, easy to operate, and quite responsive.</p>
<h2 id="bose-quot-ultra-quot-open-sound-2">Bose "Ultra" Open sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YGHJk66X86nPovfgXsXbcM" name="bose-ultra-open-single-earbud.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGHJk66X86nPovfgXsXbcM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The default stereo sound is good, and the three-band equalizer in the Bose Music app makes it even better, but it’s the Immersive Audio and Auto Volume features that elevate the listening experience to the level of premium pricing. Open earbuds are known for having middling audio because of their positioning outside of the ear canal. That’s the whole point of the product segment, after all, but Bose went into the lab and designed OpenAudio technology, which combines a powerful transducer and an acoustic structure that does a magnificent job of delivering audio into your ear.</p><p>This is great because Immersive Audio, which is Bose’s version of spatial audio, really shines with the Bose Ultra Open earbuds. It’s a virtualization that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you and allows you to choose from one of two head tracking options: Still and Motion. “Still” keeps audio in a fixed position in front of you, so no matter where you turn your head, the audio comes from one direction. “Motion” moves with you and where you turn your head.</p><p>Listening to music and movies was a joy with Immersive Audio turned on. Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 Reality audio tracks.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You'll get breat audio from the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, but there are some things you'll want to take note of.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The full audio picture is nuanced though, so let’s briefly talk about that. The louder the Bose Ultra Open earbuds pump audio, the less robust it becomes. At lower volumes, the audio pumped into your ear is richer. There’s more perceived bass response and warmer mids, with treble quality staying consistent at various volumes.</p><p>This goes back to auditory masking. The whole idea of open ear is that your surroundings are just as — if not more important than — what’s coming in through your earbuds. So, at the loudest volumes, the audio isn’t meant to be overpowering but is meant to take a backseat to whatever is going on around you. At no time during my testing was this an issue when passively listening to music, but I can see there being some challenges in very noisy places when talking on the phone.</p><p>One day during my review period, I was out on a busy street having a conversation with my father, and his audio was definitely competing with the street noise. Again, that’s a feature, not a bug, but it’s something you should be aware of. I could hear him clearly, but I had to focus a bit more than if I was wearing some active noise-canceling earbuds.</p><p>That aside, other premium features I like are audible notifications and aptX Adaptive support. Audible notifications aren’t just beeps and tones but voice prompts and confirmations like speaking the name of the phone you’re connected to or telling you the battery charge status.</p><p>Battery life has also exceeded expectations, lasting six hours with Immersive Audio and Auto Volume activated. Bose says I should be getting just four and a half hours with Immersive on. My listening level was around 20% or 30% of max volume on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a>’s volume slider, but with Auto Volume activated, it’s hard to say this was the real volume level being pumped out at any given time.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-auto-volume-and-auditory-masking"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: Auto Volume and auditory masking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-battery-barrel.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvjU2WVhHUEUSyCdYixbJK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Auditory masking is defined as “when the perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another.” Unlike earbuds, which sit in your ear, open earbuds are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/transparency-mode-killed-open-ear-headphones-for-me">very vulnerable to masking caused by environmental noise.</a> I mean, that’s the entire point of them being open. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Bose did an outstanding job of creating virtual layers without making it sound like some cheesy overprocessed audio gimmick and it works with all of your music, not just Dolby Atmos, or Sony 360 tracks. 
</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To bring balance to the experience, Bose implemented a feature called Auto Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume of whatever you’re listening to based on the noise around you. In short, when you’re in a quiet office with the volume set fairly low since there’s no competing noise then step out onto the hustle and bustle of the urban street, the Ultra Open automatically increases audio volume to combat that auditory masking.</p><p>I kept this feature on most of the time, and it did a fantastic job of raising and lowering volume as I moved through different environments. I absolutely noticed it adjusting, but it was smooth, and I think I may have noticed more because I was listening for it and being critical for this review. In time, I think I might forget that it’s happening, and I could see this feature melting into the background.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-ultra-open-earbuds-what-could-use-some-work"><span>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: What could use some work</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-demonstrating-fit.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHuaTw3EqihXyCxXkCR3rK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ok, I love almost everything about the Bose Ultra Open earbuds, except two things in particular, although one of them is just one of those “its strength can also be a weakness” conundrums.</p><p>By default, these $299 earbuds don’t come with a wireless charging case, even though their competitors include the feature. Never fear, as Bose “solves” this “problem” by giving you the option to purchase a $48 charging case accessory, bringing the total price to $348 if you want your earbuds equipped similarly to Sony’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">WF-1000XM5</a>, or Sennheiser’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a>. In 2024, for $299, the original case should already be Qi-enabled. Instead, you get USB-C charging only.</p><p>You won’t get multipoint right now, but Bose has a feature in the app that allows you to switch connections from one device to another. You can even program the earbuds with a shortcut to switch connected devices without taking your phone out. It’s a fairly functional workaround for not having multipoint.</p><p>Lastly, one feature that doesn’t actually need improvement but is more of a “caveat emptor” for those who may talk to work colleagues a lot or run with a partner is Auto Volume. As much as I enjoy the feature, I can see it becoming a nuisance for some, as it will likely increase your volume when you’re talking to people. You might find yourself deactivating the feature in that case so that your earbud’s audio isn’t competing with your real-world conversations.</p>

<p>In the open earbuds category, the only competition these have are the now aging original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-linkbuds-review">Sony Linkbuds with the donut holes</a>. In terms of contemporaries at this price point that I’ve had the chance to review, I don’t think there are any. </p><p>However, other open earbuds you can consider include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a>, which cost quite a bit less but feature rich audio and great battery life. You will have to deal with finicky touch controls, and there&apos;s no automatic wear detection or automatic shut-off, which can be a problem for those who forget to turn them off.</p><p>I don’t want to get too deep in the weeds here, but the point of open earbuds is that they don’t obstruct environmental noise, which means that, ideally, they don’t obstruct your ear canal. Knowing how soundwaves work, other than the donut hole Linkbuds, the Bose Ultra Open are among the only earbuds that don’t obstruct environmental noise or sit over your ear canal, they’re truly “open.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is hosting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/welcome-to-google-cloud-next24">Cloud Next 2024</a> conference where it got candid on new generative AI features for Workspace and the debut of a new app.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/workspace-cloud-next-2024/">Keyword post</a>, the company introduced its newest Workspace app, "Google Vids." The announcement states that this "AI-powered" video creation app can help users generate storyboards with several options for editing and stylizing. Google Vids is also said to feature voice-over capabilities. Users can pick between pre-set voices or use their own.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC" name="google-vids-video-template-example.jpg" alt="An example of the various video templates for "Google Vids."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJWwxDmF6qAAJAVaDfYYsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re having trouble with styles, Google Vids offers a range of templates users can look through. The company states its AI software will suggest scenes from stock videos, images, and background music.</p><p>Since this is going into Workspace, users can add others to collaborate on the video. Google adds that users can "share projects securely" directly from their browsers. Google Vids is expected to arrive in Workspace Labs in June 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP" name="google-docs-cloud-next-2024-ai-features-teased.jpg" alt="Google Docs is preparing to receive new customization features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XmWkEDvtMJWk4R2mqXdanP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Docs is preparing to pick up a new "tabs experience," according to the update post. The company states the new feature is designed to help users "organize related information" in a document. Better document customization is en route in the form of new cover images that extend the length of the page horizontally.</p><p>The company states this update to Docs will arrive "in the coming weeks."</p><p>Sheets is gaining new goodies for its table feature. Google says this update will make it easier for Workspace users to "format and organize" their data through its upcoming design refresh. A new array of templates will accompany this, making it easy for users to hop into a ready-made sheet without beginning from zero.</p><p>These updates for Sheets will appear "in the coming weeks" as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:291px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.19%;"><img id="6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa" name="google-gmail-cloud-next-2024-gemini-polish.jpg" alt="Gmail is receiving new voice capabilities for "Help me write" and Gemini's "Polish" arrives for Workspace customers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jUoVcuFAqT4oAkM93fdfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="291" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gmail made a quick appearance with Google preparing to roll out an update to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">Help me write</a>" that brings voice capabilities. Gemini will be included in a coming update for Gmail as it delivers a way for users to turn their notes into an email. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14199860?hl=en">Gemini in Gmail</a> is available through Workspace Labs but appears slowly as the company rolls it out.</p><p>Google states Gemini Enterprise, Business, and Google One AI Premium customers will be able to take advantage of these new tools.</p><p>Cloud Next 2024 showed Google&apos;s willingness to fine-tune some other areas of Workspace, starting with Meet. The company is planning on launching "Translate for me in Meet" in the next few months, which brings automatic detection and translation for captions. To go with this, Google is adding support for 52 additional languages.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that this will only be available to customers who purchase the new AI Meetings and Messaging add-on for $10 "per user per month." The company states this feature will arrive in June, and the add-on can be attached to "select" Workspace plans.</p><p>Lastly, "AI Security" is on its way to select Workspace plans as a $10 add-on. Google says the feature will let IT teams protect sensitive files for an entire company in Drive. AI Security does piggyback off Google&apos;s AI software. The AI is said to evaluate, classify, and protect files for users continuously.</p><p>AI security is available today (Apr. 9) for Workspace users.</p>

<ul><li>Automattic, owners of WordPress, announced that it has acquired Beeper in its quest to bring better communication to users.</li><li>Sources claim that this merger was agreed upon for $125 million.</li><li>Automattic states that its acquisition of Beeper will roll into its plans to merge it with its recently acquired messaging platform, Texts.com.</li><li>Beeper also announced it has launched its new, revamped messaging app on Google's Play Store today (Apr. 9) for all Android users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Automattic, owners of WordPress, has reportedly cemented a deal to acquire the messaging platform Beeper.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://automattic.com/2024/04/09/automattic-acquires-beeper/">press release</a>, the company states its recent acquisition of Beeper is part of its larger narrative to "push the boundaries of messaging." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-multi-service-messaging-app-beeper-for-125m/?guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a> cites sources close to the matter who state the deal was made for $125 million. Automattic teases that there&apos;s more in store with its acquisition of Beeper, as the messaging platform already supports 14 different messaging services in one app.</p><p>The post adds that Automattic will look to merge Beeper&apos;s team with Texts.com, a service the company acquired late last year. This is its "next step toward the dream of combining all online conversations in a safe, secure, and effective way."</p><p>Automattic states users can expect a "streamlined" experience once the merger is completed. When it does, Texts will fall under the Beeper brand. The company adds end-to-end encryption (E2EE), a "dozen" app integrations, and more.</p><p>Automattic doesn&apos;t have an exact timeframe for users to expect its Texts and Beeper merger to take place, but it says more updates will come when its "phased plan" is ready.</p><p>During TechCrunch&apos;s conversation with Beeper&apos;s founder Eric Migicovsky, he said the eventual plan is to manage chats under its new protocol, "Matrix." The protocol is said to feature an E2EE open-source client, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-mastodon">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Migicovsky commented on the acquisition, stating, "It was either time to raise more funding or find a buyer" due to Beeper&apos;s high costs.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.beeper.com/2024/04/09/beeper-is-now-available/">Beeper announced</a> that its new app on Android has finally launched on the Play Store. The new app brings a fresh design, the ability for users to modify their chat networks, full message search, and more. The post states that there isn&apos;t any support for iMessage, although the U.S. government&apos;s lawsuit against Apple, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24071226/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-apple-beeper-mini">FCC involvement</a>, could turn things around.</p><p>Beeper and Apple had been at it ever since the former found a way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-lawmakers-urge-doj-investigation-apple-vs-beeper">reverse-engineer iMessage</a> and bring its capabilities to Android. Apple was quick to shut it down, prompting the gaze of U.S. lawmakers who wrote a letter to the Department of Justice stating the company&apos;s actions could be "anti-competitive." Resistance didn&apos;t stop as Apple soon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-drops-imessage-integration-after-apple-bans-linked-macs">started banning</a> users of Beeper Cloud and Mini who used Macs.</p><p>The company stated it removed access to iMessage for users due to "spam." Beeper then turned and disabled iMessage support in Cloud, and it&apos;s not clear if it will ever be restored.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is bringing OxygenOS 14.0.0.505 update for Indian OnePlus 12R users.</li><li>It brings an object/person removal tool similar to the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12.</li><li>The update is incremental, with a broader rollout expected in the next few days.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out a new April 2024 update for the OnePlus 12R for the Indian region. The changelog of the latest firmware indicates that it is bringing the unwanted object removal or people tool for the photos captured on the device.</p><p>In the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1568977884347891713">community post</a>, OnePlus shared the firmware details for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, dubbed <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.505</strong> version. It is currently rolling out to the Indian OnePlus 12R users in batches. The prominent aspect of the latest update is the AIGC Remover, which was earlier available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> users.</p>
<p>The latest feature on the OnePlus 12R will allow users to "remove unwanted objects or people and make your photos look cleaner." It sounds and works very similar to Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> feature, which has been available for Pixel phones for a while now.</p><p>Meanwhile, OnePlus recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-ai-eraser-launch">announced</a> a new Pixel-inspired AI feature dubbed AI Eraser, which lets users substitute unwanted objects in a photo. The AI Eraser is available for the company&apos;s prominent handsets, such as the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus Open, and the Nord CE 4.</p><p>The other highlights from the changelog comprise the ability to create photo collages without frames in photos. A new nifty shortcut has been added to turn on the flashlight by pressing the Volume Down rocker on the OnePlus 12R for a long time. Users can also adjust volumes for apps individually with a new "app-specific" feature added with the update.</p><p>There are several other improvements included with the latest update, which are per the changelog:</p>
<ul><li>Improves the volume bar's design for ease of use and visual consistency.</li><li>Improves the touch control experience in certain scenarios.</li><li>Improves the compatibility of USB connections between phones and cars, and phones and PCs.</li><li>Improves system stability.</li></ul>
<p>As mentioned, the rollout is incremental and for the Indian region. The broader rollout is expected in the next few days, notes OnePlus.</p>

<p>OnePlus 12R comes as the toned-down version of the flagship OnePlus 12 and yet manages to retain some of its best features. Unfortunately, it doesn't support UFS 4.0, but users should still see impressive storage speeds with UFS 3.1.</p></p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is bringing the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) model to the U.S. for $329, according to a spotted new Amazon US listing.</p><p>The new tablet from Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Included-Speakers-Exclusive/dp/B0CWS8MNW1?th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=schoon0f-20&linkId=f4c5510b58649cffbf16c6798ae4d4a7&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">already listed</a> on Amazon US (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/08/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-us-amazon-price/#more-613640">9to5Google</a>) and has two storage options: a 64GB one and a 128GB variant. Both models, however, have only 4GB of RAM. The device seems to be an Amazon Exclusive for the American market, as the listing’s description implies.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 1</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="SZinsW6C9yRE9PcE3qiMx7" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-review-12.jpeg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZinsW6C9yRE9PcE3qiMx7.jpeg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Review </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>While the base variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">cheaper Android tablet</a> is priced at $329, the larger 128GB variant retails at $399. The available colorways are Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and Mint. The device appears to be shipping right away if interested buyers are subscribed to Amazon Prime.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) launched in some global markets late last month as a minor refresh to the 2020 model, which came under the same moniker. Both models appear identical in design, and most of the specs are the same except for the chipset.</p><p>The new model ships with Samsung’s in-house developed Exynos 1280 processor with 2.4GHz clock speeds — the same one that powered the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review">Galaxy A53 5G</a> handset. </p>
<p>The tablet&apos;s highlights include a 10.4-inch screen—a WUXGA Plus display with a 2000 x 1200 resolution. It supports microSD expansion up to 1TB, a massive 7040mAh battery capacity with a promise of 14-hour non-stop video playback, and Dolby Atmos-certified speakers. For optics, the tablet relies on a single 8MP rear camera shooter and a 5MP for selfies.</p><p>The device is also accompanied by an S-Pen for productivity, which includes the ability to take notes while the tablet screen is locked and support for Samsung DeX. The device also comprises two models: a Wi-Fi-only model and an LTE variant, but the Amazon above listing doesn’t mention the LTE variant.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google introduces Axion, a powerful chip designed for data centers, capable of handling various tasks including Google searches and AI operations.</li><li>Axion is Google's first custom Arm-based CPU for data centers, promising to provide significant performance improvements over current cloud tools.</li><li>Google plans to offer virtual machines powered by Axion processors to customers in the coming months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu" target="_blank">introduced</a> a brand new chip called Axion for data centers, and it&apos;s touted to be capable of handling everything from Google searches to AI tasks.</p><p>Axion is Google&apos;s first custom Arm-based CPU for data centers, built using Arm&apos;s Neoverse V2 CPU platform. Axion will be the muscle behind all sorts of things you use every day, like Google searches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-weighing-making-search-generative-experience-a-paid-feature">AI-powered tasks</a>.</p><p>Google says Axion knocks it out of the park, crushing current Arm-based cloud tools by 30% and leaving even the latest x86-based virtual machines (VMs) in the dust, with a 50% performance boost. Plus, it sips power more efficiently, saving 60% compared to those old x86 VMs.</p><p>The Mountain View-based tech giant is using the same circuitry built by Arm as Amazon and Microsoft to design the Axion chip. That makes Google the third big tech company to jump on board with this framework, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-expands-in-house-chip-efforts-in-costly-ai-battle-3121c852" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>Google says it has already put Axion to work internally, running first-party services such as BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on Google Cloud. And it plans to keep ramping up its use in the future.</p><p>Google plans to give us a sneak peek at virtual machines powered by Axion processors in the next few months. Later this year, Axion will be up for grabs for all Google Cloud customers.</p><p>To set the record straight, the company is not going to sell Axion chips directly to customers. Instead, it&apos;ll let you rent access to this custom hardware.</p><p>Google has been designing its own chips for a while now, mostly for the Pixel phones (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>) to make them faster and better. The company also makes special chips called "Tensor Processing Unit" (TPU) to help run its data centers, since way back in 2015.</p><p>There are a couple reasons why Google built Axion. First, it wants to be less reliant on other companies for parts, as per WSJ. Second, it lets the company compete better with cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft, which are also building their own superchips. Basically, it&apos;s an arms race for faster and more efficient cloud services.</p><p>Google is betting big on its new Axion chip to handle the ever-growing need for computing power, especially for AI services.</p>

You can also control the volume from an easy-to-access area so that both devices have the volume of audio you want.</p><p>Whether the earbuds you share your music with are among the best<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-spatial-audio-earbuds"> that support spatial audio</a> or not, you&apos;ll find the helpful feature. Those days of giving your friend one of the earbuds are long gone.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-samsung-dual-audio-2">What is Samsung Dual Audio?</h2>
<p>Samsung Dual Audio lets you connect your Galaxy phone to two Bluetooth headphones simultaneously. This feature is useful when hiking with friends and both want to hear the same music. You and your friend can listen to the same Spotify music list, and you can even control <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-control-spotify-music-from-strava-app">it from the Strava app</a> if you like.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-dual-audio-on-my-samsung-2">How do I use Dual Audio on my Samsung?</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Dual Audio feature won&apos;t work on all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy phones</a>. During my testing using a Galaxy A series phone, it was not available. It was not until I switched to an S series Galaxy phone that it became available. If you follow the steps but can&apos;t access Dual Audio, your Galaxy phone will not support it.</p><p>To start using Dual Audio, you must pair your first earbuds.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Connections</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and toggle it on. Make sure that the earbuds you want to pair are also on. You can also swipe down from the top of your display, long-press on the Bluetooth icon, and look for the earbuds in the Searching for Devices section. You can also choose from the devices that have been paired already.</p>

<p>4. You must <strong>pair two sets of earbuds</strong>. Don&apos;t worry about losing the connection for the first set of earbuds when pairing the second. The first connection will remain when you pair the second set of earbuds.</p><p>5. Once paired, <strong>swipe down</strong> from the <strong>top of your display</strong> and tap on <strong>Media Output</strong>. You can also try swiping down twice to check if the option appears.</p><p>6. When you see the <strong>two earbuds</strong> you paired, <strong>select them</strong>.</p>

<p>You can use any brand of Bluetooth speakers or earbuds to use the feature. As you can see in the image above, you can control the volume for both devices from the same area. You also have the option of the volume buttons as usual. If you ever want to go back to only listening to music from one device, all you need to do is deselect one of the devices.</p><p>There could be a slight lag when using Dual Audio, but hopefully, it won&apos;t be much of a problem.</p>
<h2 id="which-samsung-phones-have-dual-audio-2">Which Samsung phones have Dual Audio?</h2>
<p>Bluetooth 5.0 or higher is a requirement, but even then you won&apos;t find Dual Audio on every Samsung Galaxy. It is available on the latest S series, such as the Samsung Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>. The latest Galaxy Tabs S6, S7, S8 and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and below will come with the helpful feature.</p><p>You may not always want to have your music come from two devices. For those times when you only want to change your device&apos;s audio output to a single device, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-change-the-audio-output-on-android">these are the steps you need to follow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="two-is-better-than-one-2">Two is better than one</h2>
<p>The Dual Audio feature is a huge help. You could watch a movie, and a friend wants to listen to it. Now, you can pair their earbuds with your phone so they can listen in, and you can continue to enjoy the stereo sound of your earbuds, whether they are one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-earbuds">best Samsung earbuds</a> or not.</p><p>To ensure you always enjoy the latest features Samsung or any manufacturer has to offer, always have your apps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-better-at-updates-than-google">Samsung device updated</a>. The Dual Audio feature is a must-have, and we only hope it gets better and more accessible with time. The more devices you can share your audio with, the better, right?</p>

<p>If there&apos;s one thing the best wireless headphones under $100 prove, it&apos;s that you don&apos;t have to shell out hundreds of dollars on premium audio gear to enjoy listening to your music. Sure, you might miss out on a few nice-to-have features but for the most part, these affordable options come with all the essentials such as Active Noise Cancelation (ANC), app-based customization, and much more.</p><p>What&apos;s even better is that if you don&apos;t like traditional headphones, there are a lot of true wireless earbuds and even neckbuds to choose from. Our top vote goes to the Anker Soundcore Life Q30, a pair of headphones that offer amazing sound quality, long battery life, and ANC at an excellent price. If you&apos;d rather prefer true wireless earbuds, we suggest the Anker Soundcore Life P3. These come with a balanced soundstage, offer a comfortable fit, and have a case with wireless charging support.</p>

<p>Need long battery life? We got plenty when we reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/anker-soundcore-q30-review" target="_blank">Anker Soundcore Life Q30</a>, so you can expect up to 40 hours of playback while ANC is enabled, with that number going up to a ridiculous 60 hours when ANC is off. That&apos;s impressive for a pair of budget headphones and adding USB-C now makes fast charging possible. Plug in for five minutes and get four hours of playtime.</p><p>That kind of long battery life makes comfort a more significant factor, and thankfully, Anker delivers there. It has improved the design and materials from the previous iteration, with a nice headband with deep and wide ear cups to accommodate even the biggest ears. That combination makes longer listening periods a lot easier on your head and ears. It also means they deliver better passive noise isolation and effective ANC.</p><p>The ANC is still best at dealing with higher-frequency sounds, with minimal improvement in handling lower-frequency ones. Usually, it&apos;s the opposite, especially at this price range, which makes these unique. If you live with screaming kids, you might appreciate the help. You also get three distinct settings on the app as well.</p><p>Still, sound quality is excellent for the price, thanks to a lively soundstage out of the box that doesn&apos;t skew too far one way or the other. If you want bass, you can get even more of it through the great Soundcore app that includes a customizable equalizer and over 20 presets. It changes the overall sound to find a combination that better suits your ears.</p>

<p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">wireless earbuds</a> often get the most attention at the higher end of the pricing bracket, good ones are now easier than ever to find on a budget as well. The Anker Soundcore Life P3 stand firmly in that category with a nicely balanced sound signature. You will hear bass punch through with a slight boost to the highs, and fairly consistent mids for exceptional performance.</p><p>The comfortable design is helpful, but you need to get a good seal to get everything the sound can offer you. That way, you can hear more of what the larger drivers inside are capable of delivering, which is impressive at this price. It doesn&apos;t hurt that there&apos;s ANC onboard, with a pretty effective ambient mode to work with when you need to hear the background around you.</p><p>Make good use of the Soundcore app and the deep equalizer to change how these earbuds sound. Bluetooth connections are pretty sturdy for phone calls on top of that. The IPX5 rating isn&apos;t especially rugged, so these are maybe not the ideal pair to work out with, but they&apos;re not super fragile, either.</p><p>Battery life is OK at up to six hours with ANC on (seven when off) and another three full charges in the case to keep the music playing for a reasonable amount of time. An extra perk is wireless charging support.</p>

<p>Creative has a real knack for delivering great value for the dollar, and the Zen Hybrid over-ears follow the trend. For well under $100, you get solid audio quality with a nice mix of highs, mids, and bass. Sadly, you can&apos;t tailor the audio in the Creative app, and Bluetooth codecs are also limited to SBC and AAC, so you won&apos;t be able to enjoy hi-res audio. The SXFI spatial audio technology only works on audio files you have downloaded on your phone or tablet, so you won&apos;t get all the audio goodies without some caveats, but there are other features to enjoy.</p><p>ANC performance should meet your measured expectations for more affordable headphones, which is to say that it will muffle background sounds without heavily dampening lower or higher frequencies. The headphones feel comfortable to wear for longer periods of time and since they also fold up, you can take them with you on a commute or trip without issues.</p><p>Battery life holds up well at up to 27 hours per charge with ANC turned on, and up to 37 hours with it turned off. If you feel like going old school with a wired connection, plug in the included 3.5mm line-in cable to listen that way — assuming you have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter" target="_blank">adapter for the USB-C port</a> on your phone. </p>

<p>JLab Audio has been making workout earbuds for some time now, and the Epic Air Sport ANC earbuds are among its latest pair made to use routinely while breaking a sweat — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/jlab-epic-air-sport-anc-review" target="_blank">something we noticed when we reviewed them</a>, too. The IP66 rating gives them enough ruggedness to work out or go on a run in such scenarios. However, they&apos;re not made to be waterproof, so you need to be careful around water.</p><p>The combination of ear hooks and six pairs of ear tips make these comfortable and stable enough to stay in your ears, provided you don&apos;t mind a little extra bulk in size. What&apos;s cool is that JLab also changes things up with the tips, so you get different sizes, lengths and materials, including foam. A good passive seal always helps, though you do have ANC support to block out background noise when you need to. If you need to hear your surroundings, you can also use the Be Aware mode.</p><p>The default soundstage is mostly balanced, with bass getting an extra boost, which is par for the course for a pair of JLab earbuds. If you&apos;re not feeling that, you can easily change it via JLab&apos;s smartphone app, which offers a nice mix of ANC controls and an equalizer to customize the sound.</p><p>JLab claims up to 15 hours of battery life per charge, which is really high, though that number is relative because it applies when ANC is off. Keep it on, and that number goes down to about 10 hours. Raise the volume, and it drops down further, but it&apos;s still a very respectable figure. Interestingly, the USB-A charging cable is built into the case, though you can also use wireless charging.</p>

<p>On-ear headphones aren&apos;t as common or popular as over-the-ear cans, but they are lighter and easier to wear in most cases. On the other hand, they won&apos;t give you too much in the way of passive noise isolation, allowing you to hear what&apos;s happening around you. Jabra didn&apos;t make the Elite 45h fancy on the outside, but it&apos;s what&apos;s on the inside that counts.</p><p>The Jabra Elite 45h headphones play it safe by default with a balanced and neutral soundstage, but the sound quality is still superb. You can tweak it more to your liking through Jabra&apos;s Sound+ app and its equalizer, which gives you existing presets or the ability to create your own. Unfortunately, phone call quality doesn&apos;t follow suit, and that might be because the two-mic array needed a third one to amplify your voice. It&apos;s one of the trade-offs of a product in this price range.</p><p>Battery life hits crazy levels if you listen to the default volume throughout the day. It&apos;s the only way you&apos;ll get to 50 hours but even if you were to raise it, you&apos;d still be getting north of 30 hours without blinking an eye. On top of that, Jabra has included a modern USB-C port with them for convenient charging.</p>

<p>Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-neckband-headphones-under-100" target="_blank">neckband earbuds</a> aren&apos;t that common these days, you can still find good options like the Beats Flex Wireless. It might be easy to pass on them if you&apos;re an Android user, especially since you can&apos;t derive any benefits from Apple&apos;s W1 chip that they come with but look a little closer, and they may be worth a look. The key is the Beats app, which enables faster pairing, access to settings, and even firmware updates.</p><p>Per their reputation, the Beats Flex Wireless offer plenty of bass if you&apos;re looking for it, with a vibrant soundstage that at least gives some life to the highs and the mids. Lightweight and easy to manage, you can wear them for leisure, but be careful when it comes to workouts because there is no IP protection here. There&apos;s also no ANC on board. The good news, however, is that the two ends connect with magnets, which is super convenient for those times when you&apos;re taking a break from listening to tunes.</p><p>The neckbuds support multi-point pairing with up to two devices at the same time, like your phone and computer, for example. Listen to audio coming from your PC while picking up a phone call whenever it comes in — a switch that happens on its own. if you need Google Assistant, press the button on the neckband to wake it up and get the voice assistant talking. Also, you get up to 12 hours of battery life, based on volume levels.</p>

<p>1More usually comes up with pleasant surprises at budget-friendly prices, and the SonoFlow headphones are no different. These headphones can play up to a whopping 70 hours at their default volume with ANC off; with it on, you can still get an amazing 50 hours of use on a full charge. That&apos;s enough to listen to your music for weeks before having to charge these up again. And when you have to, plug in for five minutes, and you&apos;ll get up to five hours of playback, depending on volume levels.</p><p>The good news here is that they also sound good for all that time you&apos;re listening to them. That&apos;s in part because the 1More SonoFlow generously support Sony&apos;s LDAC codec for hi-res audio, in case you want that kind of flexibility. Once you get into the 1More Music app, you can tweak the sound even further using the equalizer.</p><p>ANC is fantastic for the price, drowning out noise in ways that remind you of what a bargain these cans are. That&apos;s great, considering how comfortable they are to wear for longer periods of time. Plus, they fold up and come with a protective case.</p>

<ul><li>A beta version of the Google app includes code and files related to the unreleased Google Pixel 9 series.</li><li>One file represents the Pixel 9's setup animation, which is new but does not reveal much about the new phones. </li><li>Another is related to a digital assistant, though it notably does not reference the rumored "Pixie" assistant that may debut alongside the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There are a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> leaks making rounds, and even more concerning the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/alleged-google-pixel-8a-cases-hands-on">Pixel 8a</a> that could launch as early as next month. However, it&apos;s rare that we get something straight from the source. While it&apos;s not much, a new beta version of the Google app reveals that the company is actively making preparations for the Pixel 9 series. There are still a lot of unknowns surrounding the smartphone lineup, but this latest leak confirms the Pixel 9 naming scheme, at the very least.</p><p>Android code sleuth <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1777414041079796063" target="_blank">AssembleDebug on X</a> noticed a few files in beta version <strong>15.14.34.29.arm64</strong> of the Google app that are directly related to the Pixel 9. These files are connected to the Google Assistant setup process, which comes from the Google app. This explains why the beta version of the Google app is the software that contains references to the Pixel 9, rather than just an unreleased Android version. There is some added significance to the Assistant setup process on the Pixel 9 since it was previously reported that the smartphone might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixie-pixel-9-report">feature a new "Pixie" digital assistant</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google App is preparing support for the upcoming Google Pixel 9 Read - https://t.co/tbzO3dmvsc#Google #Android #Pixels #Pixel9 pic.twitter.com/5oda2XcQkg<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1777414041079796063">April 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>There are two files included in the Google app beta, per AssembleDebug, that are related to the Google Pixel 9:</p>
<ul><li>assistant_robin_suw_pixel9_fragment.xml</li><li>assistant_robin_suw_pixel9.json</li></ul>
<p>The tipster explains that the first file is likely the Google Assistant setup wizard for the Pixel 9 or the Assistant setup page directly. The second file is the setup animation, which features generic Google icons and design language. Aside from the file names, there isn&apos;t much to indicate that these assets are related to the Pixel 9. Still, it&apos;s the first indirect reference to the Pixel 9&apos;s existence from Google, and it comes months ahead of the lineup&apos;s expected launch.</p><p>So far, there are also no references to the rumored Pixie assistant. Pixie, which could be an internal codename, is said to be a more powerful version of the Google Assistant leveraging on-device data and AI. Google appears to be moving away from the Google Assistant entirely, removing features in recent months and requiring Gemini users to replace Assistant on their phones. One theory is that Gemini isn&apos;t the thing that will replace Assistant once and for all — but another software feature will. </p><p>The Google Pixel 9 series is probably months away from an official launch, as Google usually unveils these phones in the fall. However, these references to the Pixel 9 in beta versions of the Google app are just the start. Rumors and leaks surrounding Google&apos;s next generation of flagship phones will only intensify as a launch gets closer.</p>
