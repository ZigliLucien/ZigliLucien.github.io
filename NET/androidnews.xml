This also means that we’re gearing up for the latest Galaxy Unpacked event. We’re expecting it to be jam-packed, complete with phones, wearables, and possibly more. Samsung is hosting its Galaxy Unpacked event in Paris, but you don’t have to jump on a flight. Instead, you can watch from the comfort of your own home, so hit the link below to learn more about the event. </p>

<p>From the way that everything appears to be shaking out, Samsung’s next lineup of foldables are taking a backseat this year. Instead, the focus is expected to be on the company’s wearables. Not only are we expecting the Galaxy Watch 7, but rumors suggest Samsung is set to announce two new products, one of which sees Samsung entering an entirely new product segment. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w"><strong>Reserve the Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra and get $50 off—No payment required</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>Let’s get the party started with arguably the most highly-anticipated product that could finally debut at Unpacked — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-name-and-release-date-leaked">Galaxy Ring</a>. Until recently, Oura has really been the only player in the smart ring market, as the original Oura Ring was released in 2015 following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Since then, Oura has released two new iterations, with the most recent being in 2023 and the 4th generation is expected sometime this year. </p><p>Other companies have joined the fray, with notable releases from Ultrahuman, RingConn, and Amazfit. Seeing the success and market heating up, Samsung wants to get in on the fun, with rumors of a potential Galaxy Ring beginning in 2023. </p>
<p>Galaxy Ring<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-smart-ring-teaser"> rumors sporadically</a> popped up as we went into 2024, and was surprisingly announced at the end of the first Galaxy Unpacked of the year. Not much was actually shared, as Samsung only showed off a teaser video, confirming the name, and that it would be released “later this year.” </p>

<p> We had to wait about a month and a half to learn more, as Samsung showcased the Galaxy Ring at MWC 2024 in Barcelona. It was here that the company began revealing and confirming what this new wearable would be capable of. This includes things such as the smallest version weighing just 2.3 grams, while the heaviest one weighs 2.9 grams. In comparison, the Oura Ring “tips the scales between 4 and 6 grams.” </p><p>Besides that, Samsung stopped short of revealing much more about the Galaxy Ring, besides that “it’s a wellness-focused gadget taking on the likes of Oura, packed with a bunch of sensors.” </p>
<p>Our very own Nick Sutrich was on the ground at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">MWC 2024</a>, and was able to get a “close-up look” at the Galaxy Ring. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a hands-on session, but Nick provided us with his own opinions while snapping a bunch of photos showing off the array of sensors on the inside of the different rings. NIck came away feeling “particularly impressed by how much the Samsung Galaxy Ring looks like a proper piece of jewelry rather than a geeky gadget.” </p>
<p>From there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">bits and pieces of information</a> about the Galaxy Ring has been rumored and/or leaked. In March, Dr. Hon Pak, head of the digital health team at Samsung, confirmed that this new wearable “lasts for about five to nine days.” The battery life is dependent on the size that you get, as the smallest Galaxy Ring is equipped with a 14.5mAh cell, with the largest coming with a 21.5mAh battery.</p>
<p>Shortly after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-release-unit-production-rumor">battery life</a> was seemingly confirmed, a report surfaced suggesting that Samsung was gearing up “to produce 400,000 units for its launch.” The same report also confirmed that the Galaxy Ring would not be labeled as a “medical device,” as the company was “still going through the required certification loops.” Instead, Samsung is expected to market the Galaxy Ring as a “wellness wearable” at launch, but that could change if the medical certification is acquired.</p>
<p>At this point, there were still a lot of questions left unanswered, but some of that changed after nine models of the Galaxy Ring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed"><u>appeared at the FCC</u></a>. This confirmed that Samsung will offer the Ring in sizes ranging from Size 5 to Size 12. The FCC appearance also gave us our first look at the “charging cradle” for the Galaxy Ring, but the filing only showed a drawing of the bottom of the cradle. </p><p>It wouldn’t be<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-charging-case-rendering-leak"> until June</a> before more information was leaked regarding the cradle, this time coming courtesy of Ice Universe. An official-looking render showed that the Galaxy Ring will likely reside in what looks to be a ring box when it needs to be charged. When the box is opened, there’s a “raised portion with the expected contact pins for charging purposes.”</p>
<p>A little over a month ahead of the expected launch date, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-sues-oura-to-prevent-galaxy-ring-patent-challenge">Samsung filed a lawsuit</a> against Oura Health Oy, the parent company of Oura Ring. It might seem like an odd thing to do considering that the Galaxy Ring was not yet released. However, the documents stated Samsung’s reasoning was due to “Oura&apos;s pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market" is an "actual, imminent risk to Samsung.” </p><p>The move makes sense from Samsung’s point of view considering that Oura pointed out that it holds “100 granted patents, 270 pending patent applications, and 130+ registered trademarks.” At the time of this writing, there has yet to be an outcome rendered in the lawsuit, which was to be expected. </p><p>By filing the lawsuit, Samsung also revealed that the Galaxy Ring was entering “mass production ‘in mid-June 2024’ and will open smart ring sales ‘in or around August 2024.’”</p>

<hr>
<p>All eyes are on Samsung, as the company is about to reveal its next-generation foldables at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-z-fold-6-flip-6-and-galaxy-ring">a Galaxy Unpacked event</a> on July 10. That includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-z-flip-6-full-specs-leak">Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which are set to offer a few upgrades over their predecessors. We’re expecting to see other cool things, too, like new Galaxy Watch models and the Galaxy Ring. However, the most exciting Samsung foldable of the year might not be released at the summer Galaxy Unpacked event.</p><p>It’s looking increasingly likely that Samsung will introduce a third folding phone at some point this year. Leakers have dubbed it the “Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim,“ and it is rumored to be a more premium version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. That could mean a lot of things—this rumored foldable might have more premium features and a higher price tag. Of course, the “slim” moniker would suggest that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim is thinner than the standard model.</p><p>According to prior reports, this ultra-thin version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 would be looking at a fourth-quarter release. One report indicated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-rumor-mill">the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim could be released in October</a>, right around the time we’d usually see new Pixels debut. Now that Google has moved up its event to an August date, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim could be the lone Android flagship released in that month. </p><p>It feels like Samsung was resting on its laurels as the king of the foldable space for a while. The company was uncontested in the U.S. foldable market for a while, but a lack of significant improvements to the Galaxy Z Fold 5 opened the door for the OnePlus Open to earn the title of best foldable, at least in terms of specs. Similarly, the company’s foldables aren’t even close to matching the devices coming out of China these days. All these factors contributed to Samsung losing the title of global folding phone shipments leader, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">Huawei taking Samsung’s top spot in Q1 2024</a>.</p><p>That’s why it’s exciting to see a rumored Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim in development that could truly rival cutting-edge foldables, especially those from Asia. However, the supposed release timeline for this device certainly complicates things for prospective buyers. If the rumored October release window is accurate, it’s smack in the middle of Samsung’s typical Galaxy Unpacked event. That might make potential Galaxy Z Fold 6 buyers wait a few months to make their purchase or make potential Galaxy S25 customers purchase a Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim early instead.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-could-be-worth-the-wait-2">Why the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim could be worth the wait</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zSPR5TTR7pDZ5SJ5HSVjYU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-back-02.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSPR5TTR7pDZ5SJ5HSVjYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The latest information about the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=28933" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, a South Korean publication with a reliable history of reporting on Samsung’s future plans. The site says that this new folding phone will feature the largest display we’ve ever seen from Samsung on a foldable. It’ll be eight inches diagonally, per the report, which is significantly more screen real estate than the 7.6-inch display on current phones.</p><p>This will mean that the cover screen will also be larger, measuring 6.5 inches diagonally. Samsung is poised to make the cover screen on the standard Galaxy Z Fold 6 slightly wider, matching the trend that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel Fold</a> and OnePlus Open ushered in. However, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will reportedly be even bigger. </p><p>The thinner design is intended to keep Samsung competitive with other Asian phone manufacturers, like Huawei and Honor. They have ultra-thin foldables available that are barely larger than a traditional smartphone. As such, Samsung might restrict sales to certain countries or regions, like Asia. The company might only make 500,000 units, according to recent reports, and it’s unknown whether the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will be available in the U.S.</p><p>There are some tradeoffs that will come with the more compact design. For example, Samsung is expected to remove S Pen support for the Slim version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. It’s unknown what it will cost or where it will be available, so there is a risk to waiting for a foldable that might be out of your price range, be missing core features, or simply be unavailable in your country or region. </p><p>With all that being said, it still might be worth waiting to see what comes of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim before buying a standard Galaxy Z Fold 6. Folding phones are too expensive to purchase, and one could be one-upped by a newer model just a few months later.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to test the waters in foldable phones but aren’t quite ready to drop a massive amount on one, the Motorola Razr 2024 is a good option to try out the design. It has decent though not top-notch specs and employs a design similar to many other foldables. With OS updates for three years, you can hand it over to someone else or sell it once you decide if you’re ready for something more premium.</p></p>

<p>The Nubia Flip 5G employs an interesting design with a small, smartwatch-sized circular external screen to complement the larger inner screen. While its hinge is durable and it opens flat, the phone has some performance issues we just can’t ignore. Plus, you can only perform limited functions from the outer screen. Thus, while it has some better specs, this phone might not be worth the investment.</p></p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Nubia Flip 5G are both foldable phones that provide an outer screen plus a larger inner screen once unfolded. If you’re considering getting a foldable phone, one of the latest trends of late, these are both good options to consider. But let’s take a look at how they compare to help you decide between the two.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">Motorola Razr 2024</a>, introduced in summer 2024, comes in funky color options, including Spritz Orange, Beach Sand, and Koala Grey. It has a 3.6-inch pOLED HDR10+ (1,056 x 1,066) external display. When unfolded, it reveals a 6.9-inch pOLED HDR10+ FHD+ 2,640 x 1,080 foldable display. </p><p>The external screen offers up to 90Hz refresh rate and 1,700 nits of brightness, so it’s decently viewable in direct sunlight while the main screen affords a 120Hz refresh rate and an impressive 3,000 nits peak brightness. The outer screen is great for viewing quick information, like calendar alerts, text messages, weather updates, and more. With Google Gemini and Google Photos access, it’s also a neat way to interact with the phone without opening it up. </p><p>Made with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, it’s a fairly durable phone with a vegan leather back and high-strength aluminum frame. It meets an IPX8 rating, which makes it resistant against water but not rated for dust, which is typical of foldable phones with a hinge like this one. </p><p>Available with 256GB storage, the 4,200mAh battery is rated to last all day, and the phone supports 30W TurboPower charging, 33W regular charging, and 15W wireless charging. But there’s no charger in the box, so you’ll need to charge it with a USB-C cable you have at home (most of us have many nowadays anyway) or purchase a TurboPower charger separately to keep it running for as long as possible per charge. </p><p>Additional basic features include 5G, USB-C as noted, NFC, fingerprint reader, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi, lock screen, personalized themes, dual stereo speakers, and quick gestures. It also has a Moto Secure folder for storing personal and sensitive information privately.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="rYVcTPb3ifzSyr9Tm4rPxK" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-8.jpg" alt="Holding a closed Nubia Flip 5G with the cover screen on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYVcTPb3ifzSyr9Tm4rPxK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3841" height="2161" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Introduced in February 2024, the Nubia Flip 5G is a foldable phone from a brand you might not know as much about. It comes in Sunshine Golden, Cosmic Black, or Flowing Lilac and is designed to be ultra-pocket-sized, offering a seamless fold and opening without wrinkles. The high-strength hinge has been tested for up to 2,000 folds. While it’s thin when folded up and unfolded, it’s also a heavier phone, so that’s something to keep in mind. </p><p>In his review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Android Central’s Derrek Lee</a> says he loves the flat frame, which reminds him of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, but finds this phone softer to the touch. Made with metallic, starlight AG etched glass with a zircon sand sandblasting frame, it has a 6.9-inch 2,790 x 1,188 OLED inner screen and much smaller, circular 1.43-inch 466 x 466 OLED external display. To put this in perspective, the outer screen is comparable in size to the typical screen on a circular smartwatch. </p><p>The circular external screen might not be what you’d expect from a foldable, but Lee loves the golden ring around it that gives it a premium feel. However, it won’t provide the same experience as you’d get with other foldables that have external screens twice the size. You can cycle through eight panels for functions like camera, calendar, and music player and see notifications, but not do anything about them (you can’t reply to a message, for example). </p><p>It comes with either 256GB or 512GB storage depending on the country and availability, and with a 4,310mAh battery that supports 33W charging. Nubia says it can charge up to 50 percent in just 18 minutes. It does not, however, support wireless charging. </p><p>With 5G connectivity, as the name implies, it also has USB-C, the older Bluetooth 5.1 spec, fingerprint reader, NFC, and dual speakers with DTS:X Ultra and Snapdragon Sound. There’s an optional face wake-up or fingerprint sensor and even mobile NFC door unlocking, which varies by country or region. </p><p>Enjoy additional features like all-care eye protection with dark, night, and read modes. With the circular front screen, you can access things like one-click call backs and even a cute interactive 3D pet. The Nubia Flip 5G, however, does not have an IP rating for resistance against dust or water.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2024-vs-nubia-flip-5g-specs-2">Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Nubia Flip 5G: Specs</h2>
<p>Let’s break down the most notable specs of these two foldable phones.</p>

<p>There are some differences here between the two foldable phones, with the Motorola Razr 2024 having a leg up in some respects and the Nubia Flip 5G in others.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2024-vs-nubia-flip-5g-operation-2">Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Nubia Flip 5G: Operation</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LFgJShXezaCaPrAAq9wbJd" name="motorola razr 2024 upright.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFgJShXezaCaPrAAq9wbJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 comes loaded with Android 14 and supports three years of software and four years of bi-monthly security updates, which is decent. It also features Motorola’s Hello UX overlay for further personalizing the look and feel of the phone. </p><p>With a MediaTek Dimensity 7300x processor, this isn’t the most powerful foldable phone. Considering most people opting for a foldable are power users on the cutting edge of technology, you might find this disappointing. </p><p>However, the phone does come with moto ai and Gemini Assistant so you can enjoy plenty of AI-powered features, both on the main phone as well as the external display. There’s a no-hand mode, for example, for incoming calls so you can answer without even opening the phone. </p><p>Along with the 8GB RAM, the phone also offers RAM Boost, which can temporarily turn storage into 8GB of extra RAM as needed. You might tap into this for more intensive tasks, like gaming. This is complemented by the dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio content so you get a favorable audio experience to go along with the bright and beautiful screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xbvS7EPcY8cr5BroM4PLe8" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-4.jpg" alt="Notifications showing on the Nubia Flip 5G cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xbvS7EPcY8cr5BroM4PLe8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nubia Flip 5G comes with a more powerful albeit mid-range Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor and offers up to 12GB RAM, depending on the version and country. Lee says it handles itself well, even when playing games at a high setting. However, the phone can get warm after a long gaming session. The 120Hz refresh rate is great but note that you need to adjust to this in settings as the default is set to 60Hz. </p><p>The phone oddly runs on the older Android 13 OS and it’s unclear how many software updates and how many years of security updates it might support. It’s strange, nonetheless, that a phone released in 2024 would come with an older version of the OS. </p><p>The phone also boasts MyOS 13 with animation speed adjustments, a wallpaper color picker, split screen, and other cool features baked in over and above the stock Android experience. But there’s nothing else worth noting about this phone.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2024-vs-nubia-flip-5g-cameras-2">Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Nubia Flip 5G: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JDWprQopjTk2DXWe83sw4d" name="motorola razr 2024 selfie.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JDWprQopjTk2DXWe83sw4d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras in the Motorola Razr 2024 are decent but won’t blow you away. You get a respectable 50MP main camera along with a decent 13MP ultra-wide camera with macro vision and a 32MP front “selfie” camera. </p><p>Motorola adds some neat photo features, like the option to tilt the phone at a 90° angle for video recording to start automatically, holding it just like a traditional video camera. There’s also the cool Photo Booth mode that will snap four consecutive photos as you make different poses, mimicking the shopping mall photo booths of yesteryear. </p><p>Additionally, the phone has a dual preview mode that allows you to view yourself on the external display while taking a selfie so you can fix your make-up or hair or adjust your pose or smile just right before taking the photo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gs3epnRpnNGJvU2DJbniRj" name="Nubia-Flip-5G-review-hero.jpg" alt="The Nubia Flip 5G outdoors and in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gs3epnRpnNGJvU2DJbniRj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3582" height="2015" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the board, the Motorola Razr 2024 has better cameras than the Nubia Flip 5G. It does have the same 50MP sensor for its AI dual camera, but there’s no ultra-wide camera, just a 2MP depth camera that’s likely not usable at all. The front camera also leaves something to be desired at a dismal 16MP, a waste for a foldable phone with so many great opportunities to take selfies. </p><p>Nonetheless, Lee says he was pleasantly surprised with the performance of the main camera, which he said took decent images when the lighting conditions were favorable that had lots of detail and vibrancy. He found the images better than ones he had snapped with the previous generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a>. He did, however, find that the phone’s camera can go overboard with saturation and you’ll lose a lot of detail when zooming in to images you have taken from further away. </p><p>There are some cool usability features when it comes to the cameras in the Nubia Flip 5G, though, including gesture and smile snap, super night camera, and fun real time photo filters so you can turn your images into ones with themes like cyberpunk, mucha, and nostalgic film styles. The circular screen also plays a role here since you can use it as a viewfinder for the camera, set a photo timer, or even swipe up and down to cycle among photo and video modes.</p>

<p>When it comes to foldable phones, there are only a limited number of them on the market to date. But that’s quickly changing as more brands are entering the category and established ones are refreshing designs and coming out with new options. </p><p>Both the Motorola Razr 2024 vs. Nubia Flip 5G are affordable options in this otherwise expensive category. We ranked the Motorola Razr 2023 as the top affordable flip phone on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a> and we’re confident that once we get our hands on it, the Motorola Razr 2024 will take its place. </p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is more of a traditional foldable phone design that gives you a big external display you can make use of when the phone is folded closed. But some of its specs are disappointing, though necessary to bring the cost down. You won’t get an ultra-fast processor, for example, and don’t even get a charger in the box. But overall, it’s a pretty decent foldable phone if you’re looking to get into this category and don’t want to spend in the thousands. </p><p>By contrast, the Nubia Flip 5G is a less traditional foldable, with an outer screen that’s more like a smartwatch screen. It has limited functionality, but still classifies as a foldable for those who might prefer the design. </p><p>Lee found the circular outer screen disappointing overall and he deems only one of the three cameras to be actually useful. The fact that the Nubia Flip 5G comes with an older OS version is odd, and the lack of wireless charging is an unfortunate omission for a phone that employs such a modern design. </p><p>Through his review period, Lee also experienced some issues with things like notifications showing up late or not at all, and found the battery barely lasted a day with mixed use of apps like social media, games, and photos. At least it recharges quickly. </p><p>Bottom line: if you’re looking for something foldable on the cheap, go with the Motorola Razr 2024, which will provide a larger external screen, some cool AI features (includes ones that can be accessed from that screen), and decent cameras. Yes, it has an outdated, slower processor. But you get what you pay for. If you need more, wait it out, save up some money, and consider another foldable that might set you back more dough but will offer much better overall performance and specs.</p>

It doesn’t cost an arm and a leg but has a design that’s a lot like many others that are twice its price. Just keep in mind that there are some concessions to be made when it comes to specs and performance if you go this route.</p></p>

It has a solid mid-range processor and a cute smartwatch-sized outer screen that some might love but others may find doesn’t meet expectations for a foldable. With some performance downsides, however, there are better options to consider.  </p></p>

The prospect of buying this flagship wearable becomes even more tempting when you see that Walmart's big sale has slashed an epic $95 off the price, clobbering the current offers from Amazon and Best Buy. </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is arguably the most powerful <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> ever built, with a huge 120Hz screen, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, and reliable 11,200mAh battery. It's also more expensive than some laptops, so we're pleased to see Walmart's sale slash over $420 off the 256GB device. Keep in mind that this is coming from a third-party seller, not Walmart itself, so the discount won't be around for long.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up for its Summer Launch event by confirming some specifications regarding its debuts on deck for July 16.</p><p>In a press release, the Chinese OEM started by detailing its upcoming Watch 2R, categorized as a "follow-up" to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>. OnePlus has updated the design of the 2R in a couple of colorways (green and black) with light, aluminum bodies. The bezels of the upcoming device look slightly different from the original Watch 2 as the 2R shifts to a "classic watch" approach.</p><p>Additionally, OnePlus adds that the variant wearable continues to feature a 100-hour battery life like its predecessor but includes "ultra-precise" dual-frequency GPS. Of course, the launch of this device follows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-china-variant-launch">its original China release</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro is next as the company seeks to redefine the midrange earbud space. Boasting a small redesign, the Buds 3 Pro can reach up to 49 dB of noise cancellation with an ultra-wide frequency range of up to 4,000Hz. </p><p>OnePlus states that these upgrades should boost the next-gen Buds over the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-nord-buds-2-review">Buds 2</a> in terms of low and high frequencies.</p><p>The Buds 3 Pro will feature 12.4mm drivers and an upgraded BassWaveTM 2.0 for deep, shapely bass tones when listening to music. These higher-tier buds are preparing to join the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/oneplus-buds-3-announcement-date-revealed">the base Buds 3</a> that launched earlier this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VJVaAM6XzPmZ6Csr7PHSVk" name="oneplus-watch-2-2024-china-launch-hero.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 China launch brings LTE (eSIM) support." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJVaAM6XzPmZ6Csr7PHSVk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1077" height="606" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out the announcements is the OnePlus Pad 2. The device is said to feature a large 12.1-inch display with a 7:5 aspect ratio. The company teased that the device would contain an "industry-leading" SoC but did not state specifically what consumers should expect. However, it seems confident that it will aid users in their daily tasks.</p><p>There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/key-specs-for-the-oneplus-pad-2-may-have-surfaced-thanks-to-this-benchmark-listing">were rumors</a> that OnePlus could opt for Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC for the Pad 2.</p><p>OnePlus is preparing to launch these products on July 16 in Milan, Italy. Interested parties can head to the OnePlus website or they can view the event live on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXHMP2nZFho&ab_channel=OnePlus">YouTube channel</a>. The festivities kick off at 9 am EDT.</p>

However, they differ significantly when it comes to their change logs.</p><p>The build to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is being rolled out extensively with regions including the European Union, India, and North America. It brings several new Touch Control improvements, such as app icons that are promised to respond faster when users tap them on their home screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, overall touch responsiveness will see improvements when opening/closing apps. The company notes in the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1628541882587938816">community post</a> that the animations are also said to be optimized when opening and closing multiple apps and when dragging them on the home screen.</p><p>Widget showcasing on the Home Screen is likely seeing improvements as well. Besides, there are several animation upgrades with the latest build on the OnePlus 12, which comprise:</p>
<ul><li>Adds Gaussian blur effects when opening and closing app icons on the Home screen.</li><li>Adds a transition animation when opening and closing Home screen widgets.</li><li>Adds a transition animation for clock widgets when the screen is turned off.</li></ul>
<p>The other system-wide improvements on the OnePlus 12 involve Lock Screen Pin/Pattern tracking, which means users can choose to turn off animation tracking while entering their Pin or Pattern while unlocking the device. </p><p>The Fluid Cloud feature, which is popular with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-oxygenos-14-android-14-hands-on">OxygenOS 14</a>, will now showcase music controls. There was a bug that would display a volume slider in Quick Settings and another one while hitting the physical volume rockers simultaneously. This is supposedly addressed with the latest firmware on the OnePlus 12. </p><p>The new release incorporates the June Android security patch and improves gaming stability. A fix seems to address the screen turning black in some instances while gaming on the OnePlus 12. These and the volume slider fixes are the common issues shared and addressed with the firmware update released to the company&apos;s first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>.</p>

<p>OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1633009335099457539">notes in the post</a> that security improvements are included on the OnePlus Open with the latest OxygenOS build. These include minimal-level permission grants for the Calendar app to provide maximum information security. The latest firmware release also improves clipboard privacy. It will automatically detect privacy information on the clipboard and prevent unauthorized app access without users&apos; consent to "minimize the risk of privacy leaks."</p><p>Other system-wide changes include music controls displayed in Live Alerts on the foldable phone. The firmware release addresses an issue where system data is taking up more storage space. Issues causing unexpected screen rotation "when switching a video app from the cover screen to the main screen" are also being fixed.</p><p>The OnePlus 12&apos;s builds are rolling out in batches for the aforementioned regions, and the OnePlus Open firmware release is currently confined to the Indian region.</p>

<p>It is almost that time of the year again folks. Amazon&apos;s annual shopping bonanza is just around the corner and I&apos;m hoping against hope that one thing in particular goes on sale for a spectacular price.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve got a wishlist of all the coolest things you&apos;d like to score this Prime Day because I know I&apos;ve got one too. My list in general could go on and on, but at the top of the stuff that I really ache to possess is the brilliant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-halo-plus-portable-projector-review">XGIMI Halo+</a> smart projector. It&apos;s big expensive buys like this that I save for deal seasons. Heck, if I only buy one thing this Prime Day, it would be this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a> projector.</p><p>Big sales like this are what help hard-working people like you and me to get the most bang for our hard-earned buck. Whether you&apos;ve just moved into a new house or are looking to upgrade your current premises, events like Prime Day do wonders for our tight wallets and big dreams.</p>

<p>Why this projector in particular? There are several reasons for that. See, I already own a respectable smart TV from Hisense with a Chromecast with Google TV dongle in my living room. The TV itself used to perform quite poorly, which is why I got the Google dongle to beef it up. The results made me very, very happy, and now I&apos;d like to bring a similar Android TV experience to my bedroom. Only, there&apos;s one major problem.</p><p>Unfortunately, my tiny two-bedroom apartment has very small bedrooms, so there isn&apos;t really much space for another TV. My colleague Harish Jonnalagadda has been banging on about XGIMI and the brand&apos;s fantastic smart projectors for a while here at Android Central, so it&apos;s about darn time I listened to his sound advice. Harish has tested many XGIMI projectors and mentioned again and again that they serve wonderfully as Android TV replacements.</p><p>XGIMI&apos;s projectors are portable and have great automatic keystone correction, so I can place them at weird angles in my bedroom to accommodate the lack of space. I want the Halo+ model specifically because it comes with a built-in battery, so I don&apos;t even have to worry about a wall socket being nearby.</p>

<p>Just like a smart Android TV, the XGIMI Halo+ comes with an HDMI port with eARC support, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a USB-A port. You get a Bluetooth remote control with a mic along with the XGIMI Halo+ and two 5W Harman Kardon speakers with Dolby Audio. The projector runs Android TV 10 out of the box and you can connect your Google Assitant to it for a hands-free experience.</p><p>As for the picture quality, the Halo+ outputs bright images that get as bright as 700 ISO Lumens. In his review, Harish said that the Halo+ delivers better picture quality than just about any other portable projector. It has HDR10 and a Full HD screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. You get a dedicated game mode with a 26.5ms latency.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="EH7eQJix7ydWFiCN2fyArh" name="xgimi-halo-plus-review-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="XGIMI Halo+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EH7eQJix7ydWFiCN2fyArh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="902" height="507" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The XGIMI Halo+ usually retails at $700. It isn&apos;t the cheapest projector offered by the brand, but the more affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a> and MoGo 2 models have lower display and brightness specs. Not to mention, the cheaper models lack built-in batteries. All of these factors come into play for me, because I want something portable but also reasonably powerful and affordable.</p><p>Since my budget is about $500 to $600, there&apos;s a high possibility that a decent Prime Day deal can strike down the XGIMI Halo+ into an affordable price bracket for me. How I wish I could consider buying the more premium offerings from XGIMI&apos;s roundup, like the Horizon or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">Horizon Ultra 4K</a> projectors, but there&apos;s no foreseeable discount that could drive down their thousand-dollar-and-over price tags to something I can afford.</p><p>The bottom line is that a smart projector is a clever solution if you&apos;re in a predicament like me. Tight spaces don&apos;t mean you have to forgo a TV. Just get an Android TV projector! If you get one on sale, it might even cost less than the price of a traditional TV.</p>

<p>Samsung announced on Monday (July 8) that it will be adding a new sensor to the coming Galaxy Watch series.  The company showed off the BioActive Sensor in an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-new-galaxy-watch-bioactive-sensor-unlocking-new-possibilities-for-preventative-wellness/">blog post,</a> stating that this will bring "more precise readings to empower users with deeper insights."</p><p>In an elaborate video showcasing the insides of what we think is the Galaxy watch 7 series and its new sensor, the company said it is to access better preventative health experiences that can record precise health insights of users. </p><p>"Samsung engineers focused on three upgrades to the new sensor: enhancing the performance of light-receiving photodiodes, adding additional colors of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and arranging them optimally across the sensor," the company added. </p>

<p>The new sensor now includes blue, yellow, violet, and ultraviolet LEDs, as well as an increased number of green, red, and infrared LEDs. Introducing a new set of LEDs would give the new watch a leg up compared to its previous generations, allowing it to " pursue unexplored aspects of health monitoring on wearables."</p><p>This will allow the sensor to measure health metrics more accurately, such as heart rate, sleep quality, blood oxygen levels, and stress levels. The company claims it will help measure the heart rate during workouts 30% more accurately than its previous models. </p><p>One new feature that is set to roll out due to this new BioActive Sensor is the support of an “Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index.” This means the wearable will be able to calculate the AGEs formed in the body based on a person&apos;s lifestyle and eating habits. </p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/advanced-glycation-end-products">Healthline</a>,  "these products are formed when sugar interacts with proteins or fats in the bloodstream," which could contribute to several health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and renal failure. We feel that this could be the company&apos;s step in the right direction to potentially measure blood sugar levels by gauging the symptoms causing AGEs to build up in the body. </p><p>"This index provides a snapshot of your biological age to help you make more informed decisions about your wellness journey and work towards a healthier future," the company added.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 and 7 Ultra </a>are set to launch at the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Unpacked </a>event on July 10 in Paris, along with the most anticipated Galaxy Ring and this year&apos;s foldable series. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Let me just start off by saying this: the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is my new favorite phone. That may not be too surprising since I spent so much time over the past year gushing over the Razr Plus 2023, but there were some pretty glaring issues with last year&apos;s model that I was willing to ignore because I enjoyed the overall experience. This year, that&apos;s no longer the case.</p><p>Motorola seemed to address just about everything that I didn&apos;t like about last year&apos;s Razr Plus while adding some upgrades I didn&apos;t expect. The result is a phone that is exactly what I wish we got last year and what I believe sets a new standard for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024</a> has its quirks. But Samsung should really be taking notes for the Galaxy Z Flip lineup because Motorola is really doing something special with its 2024 Razr lineup.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">announced</a> on June 25, 2024. The phone is available for preorder starting July 10, retailing for $999, and it will go on sale starting July 24, where it can be purchased unlocked at Motorola.com, Best Buy, and Amazon. It will also be available at T-Mobile, Consumer Cellular, and Xfinity Mobile.</p><p>On July 25, the phone will be available at the following carriers: Cricket, Spectrum Mobile, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, Visible, Google Fi Wireless, Optimum Mobile, and UScellular. Boost Mobile customers will be able to purchase the phone later this summer.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 is available in one configuration and offered in four color options: Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink. Color options will vary depending on the carrier.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3727px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="skSbUta6M7qghmVryLNtSQ" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-06.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 vegan leather back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/skSbUta6M7qghmVryLNtSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3727" height="2096" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re familiar with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, then the 2024 should look quite familiar. The design is largely the same, which is to be expected with a yearly upgrade, but there are some notable changes worth pointing out. On the front, the biggest difference is the larger cover screen, which takes up the entire front panel and rids the aluminum bar that connects to the frame. This means the only hints of color you get when looking at the phone straight on are the hinge and a bit of the frame.</p><p>Talking about the frame, it retains its glossy, rounded design, seamlessly blending into the front and back panels. However, this year, Motorola went with <del>faux</del> vegan leather for all colors, meaning you&apos;ll only find glass on the front. I really like this, as it means there&apos;s less worry when dropping the phone, although I&apos;d still recommend a case, especially a screen protector for the cover display.</p><p>I have the Spring Green colorway, but the phone also comes in Midnight Blue, Hot Pink, and Peach Fuzz. What I like about the green color option is that not only does it look good, but the material feels quite different from the other colors. It almost resembles grass in both look and feel, which makes sense given the name of the color. I honestly find this to be quite a nice touch.</p>

<p>Motorola seems to have improved the hinge this year. It&apos;s smaller when compared to the Razr Plus 2023, but it feels much sturdier when compared to last year&apos;s fairly wobbly hinge. With the Razr Plus 2024, opening the phone also feels much more satisfying and intentional, and closing it produces a much hardier sound. The hinge isn&apos;t as stiff as that of the Galaxy Z Flip 5, which I kind of prefer, as Samsung&apos;s phone often takes a bit more effort to open.</p><p>Motorola also tweaked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">water resistance on the Razr Plus 2024</a>, giving it an IPX8 rating. This means you can submerge the phone completely, and it should survive, at least up to a point. Living in Seattle, where it&apos;s often wet and there are lakes everywhere, this is a great addition. It does come at the expense of dustproofing, but Motorola says this level of water resistance inherently includes protection against dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KrYVmGmoLkmnXejc4GWS8h" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-04.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 open at an angle with a video playing and the Android Bot placed on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KrYVmGmoLkmnXejc4GWS8h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The internal display is the same 6.9-inch OLED panel, but there have been some improvements made. The crease looks and feels even less noticeable than on the Razr Plus 2023, which is saying something. The built-in screen protector also now covers more of the display, including the front-facing camera, resulting in a much more seamless-looking display.</p><p>The improvements continue once you turn the display on. Still the same 165Hz refresh rate as before, but Motorola increased the brightness by quite a bit, reaching a peak of 3000 nits. The color reproduction also appears to be much better, and the phone now gives you three display options, so you can choose between Natural, the newly added Radiant, and Vivid. I tend to keep phones on Natural because Vivid is often too... vivid. However, Radiant is a nice addition as it&apos;s a good medium between the two, so I keep the Razr Plus 2024 on this setting.</p><p>Motorola also includes flicker protection, which you might appreciate if you suffer from PWM sensitivity. I do miss the peek display feature found on previous Motorola phones, which was a clever way to utilize the AOD, but there are other sleep options that kind of make up for it, which I&apos;ll talk about later.</p>

<p>Last year&apos;s model was a bit behind with its chipset, using a slightly older Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1. This year, Motorola is using an up-to-date flagship chip with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, although it&apos;s still a slight downgrade compared to the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. You wouldn&apos;t really know it in regular use, however, as the phone performs spectacularly. Apps open quickly, I don&apos;t notice the usual lag when recording video, and the phone seems to be able to handle background apps much better, likely thanks to the 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis default to high or ultra settings, and they load fast with virtually no gameplay issues. Honkai can even handle the highest settings at 60fps, and gameplay is smooth.</p>

<p>The audio situation isn&apos;t bad, but it could be better. The phone features dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and support for spatial sound. The speakers sound fine, although they&apos;re a bit hollow when playing music. I&apos;m no audiophile, but the audio isn&apos;t as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, which sounds very deep.</p><p>You also won&apos;t be blown away by the phone&apos;s haptics, but I&apos;m happy to say they&apos;re at least much better than Motorola&apos;s lower-end phones.</p><p>You&apos;ll find Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and sub-6 5G. There&apos;s no mmWave (sorry, Verizon subscribers), which is likely so Motorola can keep costs down. There&apos;s also no UWB, which is an odd choice given the simultaneous launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">Moto Tag</a>, which utilizes the tech to locate your items with phones that support it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MCEVZ7aREUpse6VUTeP8pX" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-14.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCEVZ7aREUpse6VUTeP8pX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite thing about the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is the cover screen, and it&apos;s how I interact with the phone most of the time. It&apos;s now a larger 4-inch OLED panel with a high pixel density and 165Hz refresh rate. Is that overkill? Perhaps. My main complaint last year was that 144Hz on a 3.6-inch OLED wasn&apos;t doing much to help the abysmal battery life situation. That said, Motorola opted for an LTPO panel on the Razr Plus 2024, which means the display will dynamically adjust the refresh rate based on what&apos;s being displayed.</p><p>This should help improve the battery consumption from the cover screen, although I would like it if Motorola would let me adjust the cover screen refresh rate on its own from the main display. Still, the display is a massive improvement over the Razr Plus 2023, with a peak brightness of 2400 nits, so it&apos;s much more visible outside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJqycvUH5dTgkNg98H4vig" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-11.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen widget panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJqycvUH5dTgkNg98H4vig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola also tweaked the software on the cover screen, so it&apos;s much more useful. For instance, you can now set app shortcuts on the home screen. There&apos;s also a new widget panel to put your favorite widgets in one space.</p><p>Meanwhile, other panels have been revamped with better visuals, and there are even new animations. Motorola even added a new pinching gesture that lets you see all your panels at once, something that was shamelessly borrowed from Samsung.</p>

<p>Regardless, the new UI looks and feels a lot better and much more thought out. Little quality-of-life updates add to the experience, like now being able to enter a full-screen text mode when typing so that you can actually <em>see</em> what you&apos;re typing, something that was often an issue with the previous Razr Plus. Google services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> can now be viewed in full screen, and you now have access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> from the cover screen. There are also new music player skins, which I think is a very nice touch.</p>

<p>I will say that setting up the cover screen can be a bit of a hassle because it feels like you have to set up the Razr Plus 2024 twice. You select which panels you want, which apps you want to access from the Apps panel, and which contacts you want to add... it&apos;s a lot. But once it&apos;s all set up, using the cover screen is quite fun and fairly easy to get the hang of, especially when transitioning apps from the main screen to the cover screen and vice versa.</p><p>The added screen real estate gives apps more space to shine, although vertical videos will still often be cropped down, meaning you&apos;ll have to open the phone to get the full picture. I also find that some apps like Instagram won&apos;t hold your place in the feed when you move from the cover screen to the main display, which can be annoying.</p><p>When you&apos;re not using the phone, Motorola has added two new idle modes: Sleep display and Desk display. The Sleep display is where you&apos;ll find the new AOD, which lets you view the time, notifications, and other info while the phone is locked. You can also wake the display just by bringing your hand up to the cover screen without touching it, or you can nudge the phone to wake it up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mJwgCRZeUoecu7rftmd773" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-15.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Desk Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJwgCRZeUoecu7rftmd773.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Desk display, when the phone is open at an angle or set up like a tent, the display will act as a screensaver of sorts. It will display a carousel of images, notification icons, battery level, time, and more, and you can use preset images or add your own to the carousel. It&apos;s not a terribly useful feature, but it&apos;s a nice addition nonetheless, and I like that Motorola is looking for ways to take advantage of the flip phone form factor.</p>

<p>Software on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has been a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, I like the new Hello UX, as it feels like a welcome departure from the stock Android experience that Motorola has largely stuck with until now. It&apos;s not a huge overhaul, but there are some new UI aspects like the new Control Panel and Settings menu that are clearly different, and while some may be borrowed from other OEMs, I like the changes.</p><p>That said, Hello UX — which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> — should feel familiar for the most part, aside from the revamped Control Panel (you can always switch back to the stock quick settings/notification experience, as this is the default).</p><p>While I like the changes Motorola has made, there are moments when the software would freeze on me when switching from the main display to the cover screen, and both displays would appear black for a little bit before returning to normal. It happens every now and then, but not enough to really annoy me since it fixes itself fairly quickly. There are some other small software issues I&apos;ve come across while using it, but I imagine these things can be fixed easily with an update. Still, it would be nice if it were a bit more polished.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Motorola's new Hello UX feels like a welcome departure from the stock Android experience, but there are some quirks.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Fortunately, Motorola retained its most useful features, like gestures to turn on the camera or flashlight and the side panel for opening your most used apps. The Razr Plus 2024 also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>, which works like a charm on my ASUS laptop and can be used to drag and drop content across devices, control multiple devices with one mouse and keyboard, or use a laptop or external display as a mobile desktop.</p><p>One new addition to the mix is Moto AI, which is being sprinkled throughout the software. Right now, you&apos;ll find it in a few experiences, such as the camera. For instance, with Style Sync, you can take or upload a photo, and the phone will create a wallpaper based on the image. The idea is to snap a photo of your current outfit so your phone can match.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Magic Canvas. It&apos;s an interesting take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpaper</a> feature that you&apos;ll find on devices like the Pixel or some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> with Android 14. Essentially, you type a prompt, and the phone will generate what you wrote. It&apos;s a fun feature, although the results are a bit too artsy for my liking. And while I previously found Samsung and Google&apos;s method of having users insert preselected words within prewritten prompts a bit limiting, I can&apos;t help but wish Motorola had gone with that instead of trying to create its own wallpaper feature from scratch.</p>

<p>Tragically, some of the more interesting Moto AI features are not yet available on the Razr Plus 2024, although they are expected to arrive soon. One feature takes your notifications and summarizes the most important information to catch you up on ongoing conversations you may have missed. There&apos;s also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature that remembers certain details for you based on your interactions by taking and saving snapshots (on-device) or by you telling Moto AI to "pay attention" so that it records and summarizes conversations for you.</p><p>Motorola says these features will arrive "in the coming months," but it would be nice if they were available at launch, as some of them seem legitimately interesting. But for now, new Razr Plus 2024 owners will just have to settle for three months of free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Moto AI sounds like Motorola's answer to Gemini and Galaxy AI, but many features aren't here or feel half-baked.</p></blockquote></figure>

That said, Motorola doesn&apos;t have a great track record with software updates, and while the Razr Plus 2023 received regular bi-monthly updates, it only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">just started receiving Android 14</a> in the first week of July, nine months after it started rolling out on other devices.</p>

<p>I&apos;m happy to say that the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has improved a lot in the imaging department. The 50MP primary sensor is a major step up from the 12MP sensor on last year&apos;s model, and Motorola&apos;s new AI-powered image engine proves to be quite capable.</p><p>Images from the Razr Plus 2024 are crisp and detailed, with a good amount of contrast and saturation without going overboard. It&apos;s almost a stark contrast to last year&apos;s Razr, which often produced flat and lifeless images, even if it leaned on truer-to-life color reproduction.</p><p>White balance is also much improved and the phone seems comfortable in most lighting conditions. Low-light and nighttime images aren&apos;t particularly strong, and you&apos;ll find some hits and misses, but I was able to capture some decent images of fireworks on the 4th of July. </p>

<p>There&apos;s no ultrawide camera, which might deter some of you, but I actually don&apos;t mind that Motorola switched it out for a 2x telephoto lens. The 50MP sensor actually produces images that are just as good as the primary camera and lets the phone retain a surprising amount of detail even at 8x zoom. Both lenses also have good natural bokeh, although it&apos;s slightly better with the portrait mode, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>As usual with the Razr Plus, you can use the cover screen to offer a preview of the image before you take it, which helps your subject position themselves. And of course, Motorola has also included some unique features with the camera like Adaptive Stabilization, which helps keep the video stable during intense movement, giving you an almost action-cam-like experience. There&apos;s also an easily accessible Action Cam button, which helps you capture fast-moving subjects and keep them in focus.</p><p>Another way Motorola is taking advantage of the flip phone form factor is with Auto Camcorder, which automatically starts recording as soon as you fold the phone 90-degrees, like an old-school camcorder. This mode also turns the bottom half into a touch pad of sorts, so you can use your thumb to easily zoom in and out while recording.</p>

<p>Battery life was a weak point of last year&apos;s Razr, but I&apos;m happy to report that I&apos;m actually quite pleased with the Razr Plus 2024 battery life. While the 2023 model could barely get me through half a day, the Razr Plus 2024 gets me through a good portion of the day—at least to the end of my work day after waking up at around 6 a.m.—on a single charge. You might be able to squeeze out a full day, depending on your use, but I&apos;m admittedly a pretty heavy user. Still, it&apos;s nice to no longer have battery anxiety if I decide to leave my home with a 50% charge.</p><p>Meanwhile, charging speeds have also improved, thanks to 45W wired and 15W wireless charging support. You&apos;ll need your own 45W or higher charging adapter, but I&apos;d suggest springing for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-100w-chargers">100W charger</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the closest competitor to the Razr Plus 2024 is the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The phone features last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and a fairly large 3.4-inch cover screen. Camera quality is pretty good, and Samsung excels with software support, although the cover screen functionality is fairly limited compared to the Razr. The phone will also become old news once the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is launched, which will likely happen on July 10 during Galaxy Unpacked 2024.</p><p>Honor recently revealed its first flip phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch">Honor Magic V Flip</a>, which also features a 4-inch cover screen. The unique software saves a small section of the cover screen for the time and notifications, while the remaining presents a vertical app display that supports more than 40 apps. Yet, while there are some impressive specs, the phone is powered by a much older Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 and is only available in China.</p><p>If you want to go cheaper, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> is a low-cost flip phone with a great design, a decent 50MP camera, and good performance. Of course, you miss out on the app experience with its smaller cover screen, the software isn&apos;t great, and there&apos;s no IP protection.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are looking for a modern flip-style phone.</li><li>You want a phone with a good camera.</li><li>You own last year's Razr Plus... it's really so much better.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want reliable software support and fast OS upgrades.</li><li>You prefer to have an ultrawide camera over a telephoto sensor.</li></ul>
<p>To say that I&apos;m impressed with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is a bit of an understatement. Motorola actually listened and addressed the biggest shortcomings of last year&apos;s model, giving us better battery life, better cameras, better hardware, and even a better cover screen experience. The 2023 model already seemed ahead in many ways, setting a standard for the flip phone category that was once established by Samsung. Now, Motorola is using the Razr Plus 2024 to solidify itself in the foldable space with a flip phone that&apos;s almost perfect.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect, and the Razr Plus 2024 may not be enticing to everyone, especially after swapping the ultrawide camera for a telephoto lens. However, if that doesn&apos;t bother you, I feel like many of my biggest gripes can (and likely will) be addressed with some software updates.</p><p>Even with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 right behind it, I have a feeling the Razr Plus 2024 will be the best flip phone of the year.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 takes things up a notch with great performance, better battery life, and an even larger cover screen. It also brings improved cameras and a 2x telephoto sensor that gets you up close and personal when taking portrait shots. With Hello UX and Moto AI, this is the ultimate flip phone for creators.</p></p>
