<p>In an age where fitness watches and smart rings use passive health data and hidden algorithms to judge your health and athleticism, Polar takes a direct user approach. The Vantage V3 has a dedicated section for "Tests" on everything from nightly recovery and ECGs to VO2 Max. And while automatic tracking is more futuristic, I&apos;m a fan of this alternative.</p><p>The annoying part of buying any new smartwatch is the learning period. You&apos;re promised the equivalent of a constant doctor&apos;s physical and a PE test on your wrist. But once you put it on, you&apos;ll wear it for days, if not weeks, before the software will share its findings or properly gauge your health and fitness level. </p><p>Blame my inability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep soundly while wearing a smartwatch</a> or the fact that this job makes me switch watches every few weeks, but it&apos;s difficult for me to sustain interest in a new product long enough to take advantage of these features or remember to seek out the information once it&apos;s finally ready. </p><p>On the fitness side, I can&apos;t tell you how often VO2 Max data on a smartwatch is woefully incorrect from the start, based on run data that couldn&apos;t possibly provide the insight necessary to make that kind of judgment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-cardio-load-status.jpeg" alt="A Cardio Load Status screen of "Overreaching" on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar isn&apos;t so different from these other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands in that it&apos;ll also measure your VO2 Max, nightly recharge, and other data passively over time. But it also lets you take that into your own hands, so to speak, with its active testing section. </p><p>I can look at my "Cardio Load Status" to see whether Polar&apos;s algorithm thinks I&apos;m ready to work out or "overreaching" based on my abilities. But if the estimate doesn&apos;t match my <em>perceived</em> energy level, Polar has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.polar.com/e_manuals/vantage-v/polar-vantage-v-user-manual-english/content/orthostatic-test.htm" target="_blank">orthostatic test</a> that takes a snapshot of my heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest or while standing.</p><p>A full night of HRV data will give Polar more data to work with. But if you don&apos;t sleep with your Polar or wear a different tracker to bed (like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>), this gives you the info necessary for a judgment call after four minutes of relaxation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-orthostatic-test-result.jpeg" alt=""Test result: your cardio system is recovered" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Despite "Overreaching" on my training, my orthostatic test found that my body isn't as tired as the algorithm thinks.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even better, Polar has a "leg stiffness" test that measures your muscular recovery after runs. </p><p>Every post-run marathoner knows the feeling when their heart has recovered but their legs need another week. Other times, my legs feel fine, but my worn-down heart treats a jog like a sprint. Despite that, most fitness watches lump together cardiovascular and muscular recovery by necessity.</p><p>It&apos;d be nice if these watches could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form analysis</a> to adjust recovery time. I&apos;m sure tired muscles affect our vertical lift or cadence or could make our stride imbalanced. In lieu of that, Polar has you jump up and down three times with your hands on your hips. After a couple of tests, it&apos;ll have a baseline for your normal jumping abilities; if you fall short, you know you&apos;re not ready for a hard run. </p><p>I appreciate that Polar lets me check my physical recovery for myself instead of relying blindly on the algorithm. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-vo2-max-running-test.jpeg" alt="The VO2 Max running test on the Polar Vantage V3; showing a target pace, current pace, current/max heart rate, and other data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then we have my absolute favorite: Polar&apos;s VO2 Max running test. I first tried it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-pro-review">Polar Pacer Pro</a>, one of my first running watch reviews, and I&apos;ve happily returned to it now that I&apos;m testing the Vantage V3. Essentially, it has you slowly pick up your pace from 15:00/mile downwards until you can no longer keep up, for about 10–15 minutes of easy-to-all-out running.</p><p>I ended up tiring out as I hit the sub-6:00 pace window and was rewarded with a 53. For context, that&apos;s two points higher than my Garmin VO2 Max average (51). Polar calls it "Very Good" for my age and gender, while Garmin would call it "Excellent." Either way, it&apos;s an improvement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">where my VO2 Max was a year ago</a>.</p><p>I don&apos;t know which is more accurate; Garmin works from months of data, while Polar uses the traditional self-guided method. The only <em>definitive</em> way would be to go to a testing lab that measures your breathing on a treadmill. </p><p>Frankly, it doesn&apos;t matter to me which is better. I just want multiple ways to test for myself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nC3HVffruSJdbweXEy9xNK" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-vo2-max-2.jpeg" alt="Post-running test VO2 Max on the Polar Vantage V3, with a score of 53 (Very Good)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nC3HVffruSJdbweXEy9xNK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Raising your VO2 Max is a long, arduous process of increasing your training load week by week; the more you improve, the longer it takes to gain a point. At times, I&apos;ve questioned whether or not I&apos;m <em>actually</em> improving or if my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and its algorithm merely reward me for following the training load suggestions. </p><p>That&apos;s why having a way to spot-check your VO2 Max is so heartening. Seeing that 53 validated all of the hard track runs and boring low-aerobic jogs I&apos;ve done to try and improve over the past year. </p><p>It also triggered my competitive side: next time I do a manual VO2 Max test, I&apos;m not going to <em>let</em> myself get left behind until I push further into the 5:XX range and score higher!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="8o9oZaxYXwUyS7mnupFryS" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-and-Polar-Vantage-V3-showing-elevation-data.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 and Polar Vantage V3 worn on one arm, showing elevation data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o9oZaxYXwUyS7mnupFryS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Polar Vantage V3 and Garmin Forerunner 965 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whichever smartwatch brand you buy, you must trust its algorithm, with no way to tweak the numbers or peek behind the curtain. You must have faith in a brand&apos;s reputation, and then spend weeks or months finding out whether the algorithm truly understands your fitness level and how often you need rest.</p><p>But even with the most reliable brand, worn for a long time, it doesn&apos;t always get things perfectly right. And that&apos;s to be expected!</p><p>Polar&apos;s algorithm isn&apos;t any more imperfect than other brands&apos; data. But the Vantage V3&apos;s testing suite caters to athletes who want to double-check Polar&apos;s suggestions for themselves, especially in the early days of using the watch, and I appreciate that Polar doesn&apos;t insist on blind trust — as other brands do.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;ll have my Polar Vantage V3 review completed by next week. Thus far, it did pretty well in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">fitness test against COROS and Garmin</a>. I appreciate its comfortable design and straightforward access to specific tools — like Tests — with one or two button presses. </p><p>More pertinent to this discussion, I&apos;m hopeful that Polar will continue to expand this testing section over time. It has running, walking, and cycling fitness tests, all variations on the same theme, along with recovery tests. Maybe Polar could offer a hill/stair climber test to see how well you handle elevation gain or an arm strength test to go with its indoor exercise recommendations. </p><p>Dedicated athletes are competitive people, and when you give them a way to test and compete against themselves and their own fitness scores, that&apos;s always a recipe for success. </p>

This time, in a fresh round of layoffs, Google let go of 200 of its &apos;core&apos; employees to move faster and align with the company&apos;s goals.</p><p>These core teams were responsible for the technical foundation behind many of Google&apos;s products and services for security and online safety. The company has also reportedly started a "reorganization" that moves roles to India and Mexico.</p><p>Documents obtained by CNBC also suggested that employees found out about these cuts a week before they were announced, with Google stating that it would help it align with its "broader goals." Google&apos;s vice president of its Developer Ecosystem, Asim Husain, informed staff that "this was the biggest planned reduction" for the team in 2024, during a town hall. These cuts come at time, after Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 earnings report</a> announced a whopping $80.5 billion in revenue with "strong performance" across services. </p><p>Google confirmed these layoffs, and a spokesperson added that those affected can reapply for other roles within the company.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2024-earnings-report"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Samsung posted its revenue report for Q1 2024, and the company states it earned 71.92 trillion KRW in consolidated revenue and 6.61 trillion KRW in operating profits. During its earnings call, the company stated that its Q1 earnings saw a 12.8% jump compared to last year.</p><p>Samsung feels that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is the driving force behind its phone sales, stating it will "seek annual growth." The company also hinted at expanding its Galaxy portfolio by bringing Galaxy AI to "existing and new flagship" products like foldables and tablets. The other side of this business is its wearables, to which Samsung mentions the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>—something that could boost revenue later this year.</p><p>Smartwatches will also play a role, with Samsung stating it will look to "meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models." It&apos;s unclear exactly what Samsung means here, but rumors of an expanded Galaxy Watch profile have been circulating, with talk of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, 7 Classic, and 7 Ultra. </p>

The company reported $9.39 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 1% over the same quarter in 2023.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s headset business, which makes up most of its overall revenue, also saw a 1% increase during the quarter, reaching $8.03 billion. While this may not seem like a large gain, it signals healthy growth in the smartphone industry after a bit of a slump just a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q2-2023-earnings">FY Q2 2023 earnings</a> revealed a 17% drop in headset and overall revenue, so the recent numbers look positive.</p><p>"We are excited about our continued growth and diversification, including achieving our third consecutive quarter of record QCT Automotive revenues, upcoming launches with our Snapdragon X platforms, and enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories," says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in a statement.</p><p>With its current chipsets, Qualcomm is focusing on AI, which it expects will enable more use cases in various devices, be they phones, PCs, or cars. The company highlights its AI hub for developers to help drive this adoption.</p><p>"I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices," Amon says. "I think AI, when extends to running on-device—besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud—they have completely new use cases privacy, security, latency cost, personalization, etc."</p>

This is good news for anyone worried that the Pixel Tablet was poised to replace Google&apos;s smart displays since the tablet launched with a few features and accessories that made it an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">"almost" replacement</a>.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking about this a lot lately and realized that Google needs to mash the Nest Hub and Pixel Tablet together and create something new and better.</p>

<p>A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> that runs an instance of Gemini Nano is a thing Google could easily create. Imagine a Pixel tablet inside a bigger body, minus the battery, with a speaker (or two) added and you&apos;re almost there. I&apos;m not saying hardware design is easy, but this sounds more like a hardware mod than a big engineering project. </p><p>Android is easily modified on the software front so that a home interface that looks and feels like the existing Nest Hub software can be added, and all the things that make it complicated can be removed or hidden. </p>
<p>You would be left with a screen with a touch interface when you need it, a camera and/or sleep sensor array, a speaker that sounds nice, and apps like Chrome and YouTube to provide a good media experience. The ability to install things like the Netflix or Spotify app could make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-home-products-under-100">best smart home</a> devices you can buy.</p><p>More importantly, you can replace Google Assistant with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> running on the device. That&apos;s where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a> comes into play, and this would be the best part.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf" name="google-gemini-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Android at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini Nano is when smart AI "stuff" runs mostly on your device without reporting back to the Google mothership. It&apos;s built into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, powering various tools and all sorts of fancy camera tricks.</p><p>It&apos;s an important step forward for Google&apos;s AI team because, previously, almost everything had to go through the cloud. Google still offers bigger and more powerful AI models like Gemini Ultra that lean heavily on cloud computing, but with Gemini Nano, a mobile CPU, and some extra memory, you can do many things locally.</p>
<p>This is important. Local computing means everything is more private, is done faster, and doesn&apos;t rely on having a good internet connection. I don&apos;t care if Google knows how many times I turn the lights on or off or that I asked what the square root of 15 was (3.87, I saved you a click). I might care about the next smart display feature, though. And if any AI processing is to be done on a camera-equipped device in my bedroom, I&apos;d rather it be locally. I <em>might</em> be able to peel the tape covering the lens off. Might.</p><p>Even better, Gemini can do so many things better and faster than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> can. Yes, I know there are things Assistant can do that Gemini can&apos;t or struggles to get right, but I assure you that Google is working on Gemini and wants to replace Assistant completely. Out with the old, in with the new, even if it doesn&apos;t work 100% of the time. That&apos;s the Google way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9eYCi6dwPmZmT6nK8gFWoK" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Pixel Tablet on kitchen countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eYCi6dwPmZmT6nK8gFWoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Gemini means a Home Hub can be more than a light switch or a way to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-vs-nest-doorbell-battery">who is knocking on the front door</a>. The way it can parse information and do other things with it is what AI is good at doing, and as a bonus, it can better interpret the things we tell it to do. Here at Chez Hildenbrand, we love to yell out to Google so it can add stuff to the grocery list. Gemini does that better because it understands us better. That&apos;s pretty important for a voice-operated device. I do not doubt that Gemini will eventually power <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart displays</a>.</p><p>This would be in Google&apos;s best interests, too. Sell a Nest Hub "Ultra Max Pro" (or some other silly name) powered by Gemini Nano that does everything advertised on the box. Power users could buy into more powerful versions of the Gemini AI model if they wanted, providing Google finds a way to build compelling features using them.</p>
<p>I used to think replacing a cheap smart display with yet another Android device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-pixel-tablet-isnt-going-to-fix-whats-wrong-with-android-tablets-on-its-own">Pixel Tablet</a> was a bad idea because there was no benefit that was worth the cost. With the release of Gemini Nano, I&apos;m not so sure about that anymore.</p><p>I still want to see a basic (and cheap) Nest Hub that works the same (infuriating) way it works now, but I also want to see more. And better. Google can do this, and it just might if the company thinks it&apos;s something we want to buy. I have a feeling people would want to buy it once they understand why.</p>

It also offers an impressive battery life, easy compatibility with both iOS and Android, and a really pretty overall design. Depending on your price point, you may not mind a few of the Versa 4&apos;s downsides, like how it doesn&apos;t include Google Assistant capabilities, third-party app support, or basic music streaming.</p><p>Either way, $50 off makes this smartwatch pretty appealing, even with its shortcomings.</p>

<p>At 25% off the normal purchase price, the Fitbit Versa 4 is a pretty solid deal, especially if you need a basic, bare-bones smartwatch.

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> starts at a fairly reasonable price point, but the extra $50 discount makes it a little easier to overlook some of the watch's downsides.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re just looking for a simple, no-frills fitness smartwatch at a good price; battery life is a big selling point for you; you&apos;re looking for a watch that can resist some water submersion.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t mind paying a little more for a premium smartwatch.</p><p>We called the Versa 4 one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbits</a> that money can buy, and despite a few minor issues and some somewhat dated hardware, it remains a good option for most people, especially when you pair it with a deal like this.</p><p>With its reasonably sized 1.58-inch AMOLED display and super minimal design, this is a pretty good-looking fitness watch overall. The upsides of the Versa 4 also include its over-six-day battery life, quick charging, and a range of basic sensors like GPS, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and more. It&apos;s also highly compatible with iOS and Android, as well as Alexa, though it doesn&apos;t work with Google Assistant. </p><p>Those willing to spend a little extra might consider the Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>, but at this price point, you really can&apos;t go wrong with the Versa 4, either. </p>

<hr>
<p>The global smartphone market appears to be rebounding, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> especially finding success in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartphone-market-q1-2024/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>.</p><p>Overall, the market grew by six percent year-over-year despite Apple shipping far fewer iPhones last quarter than during Q1 2023. In part, that&apos;s due to the success of Samsung Galaxy phones. A strong launch of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A-series smartphones</a> appears to have vaulted Samsung above Apple as the global leader in shipments.</p><p>Samsung is typically the top smartphone manufacturer in terms of total number of shipments, but it lost that title to Apple in Q4 2023. However, as Apple posted a 13% decline in shipments year-over-year in Q1 2024, Samsung was able to recapture the leading position. Samsung devices represented 20% of the total smartphones shipped last quarter, while iPhones slipped to 17%. </p><p>As has been the case in past quarters, the premium smartphone market continues to grow. According to Counterpoint, the market segment, including phones priced above $800, was the fastest to grow in Q1 2024. Apple benefitted big from this trend last quarter because it has the highest average sale price (ASP) of any OEM at $900. This is presumably due to buyers picking the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">15 Pro Max</a> over the base models. </p><p>Additionally, Apple retained its spot as the smartphone revenue leader with a 43% share of the market. Still, that figure is down 11% year-over-year, and there are a few reasons why. </p><p>"Tough competition in China, record low upgrades in the US and a difficult compare from last year due to iPhone 14 Pro&apos;s supply shifting to Q1 2023 all weighed on iPhone performance," says Counterpoint Research Director Jeff Fieldhack. "An improved product mix with 15 Pro&apos;s performing better than its predecessors, and an increasing footprint in emerging markets, helped Apple in arresting some of the declines."</p>

<p>The overall growth can be partially attributed to select brands&apos; success in regions outside of North America, including TECNO, Xiaomi, Honor, and Huawei. Of the top five OEMs, Xiaomi grew the most last quarter, improving shipments by 34% year-over-year.</p><p>Looking ahead, the analysts at Counterpoint expect the premium smartphone market to continue growing. This is because of the expected release of new phones with generative AI functionality. Counterpoint predicts that 11% of smartphones shipped will feature generative AI this year. If Apple ends up including gen-AI features on the next iPhone series, joining the likes of Google and Samsung, this will likely end up being the case. </p>

The tech uses crowdsourced Bluetooth proximity data to locate devices, With billions of Android devices in use worldwide, this significantly increases the accuracy of the service, and if you&apos;re using the Pixel 8 or 8 Pro, it can locate offline devices as well.</p><p>There&apos;s no user intervention needed; Find My Device is enabled out of the box on all Android phones, and if you have location enabled on your phone, it is active from the moment you set up your device. What I like the most about the new features is that it can locate devices inside your home — provided you have a Nest device. The service also includes Bluetooth trackers now, and they&apos;re set to debut later in Q2 2024.</p>

<p>Find My Device is the only tool you&apos;ll need to track your missing phone. The best part is that it comes installed out of the box, and once you set it up, you don&apos;t need to do much with it. </p><p>Having a service like this is handy, but you should also make it a point to jot down your phone&apos;s IMEI and serial numbers. You can never be too careful, and in a scenario where you lose your phone, or it gets stolen, an IMEI number lets you de-register the phone from cellular networks.</p>

We&apos;ll find out the truth at the next Unpacked event; the real question is, what will a Samsung "Ultra" watch look like, and how will it differentiate itself from the Apple Watch Ultra series?</p><p>Last week, I finished my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2 review</a>, saying, "Your move, Samsung," because I hoped the brand would take inspiration from its premium features for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 Pro</a>. Days later, by happy coincidence, Samsung said it would launch "new premium models" of Galaxy Watches with "upgrades" during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2024-earnings-report">Q1 2024 earnings call</a>. Its execs didn&apos;t elaborate, but soon after, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-coming.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> claimed to have spotted "Ultra" and "Fan Edition" watch model names in its One UI beta code.</p><p>I don&apos;t care whether it&apos;s called the Galaxy Watch Ultra, 7 Ultra, or 7 Pro. What matters to me, after reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, is that Samsung gets its "premium" smartwatch right from the start, even if it has to steal tricks from Apple, OnePlus, Garmin, or other brands to do so. </p>
<h2 id="it-should-kick-apple-apos-s-a-in-battery-life-2">It should kick Apple&apos;s a** in battery life</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro launched in 2022 with pretty consistent three-day battery life, but natural capacity drain and annual One UI updates cut into its battery life. My colleague Andrew Myrick, who owns the 80-hour 5 Pro and the 36-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ultra-review-actually-the-best-apple-watch-for-most-people-this-year">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, says his Ultra lasts longer in 2024. </p><p>A Wear OS flagship, Samsung-made or otherwise, will cost as much as a mid-range smartphone if not more. An "Ultra" watch needs the longevity to match, or Samsung&apos;s most loyal customers will feel burned. </p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-could-get-better-battery-life">April Samsung leak</a> indicated its next flagship smartwatch would have a 578mAh capacity, on par with the Watch 5 Pro. We rarely see any watch hit above 600mAh; more capacity would make any watch too thick or heavy. So, how will Samsung make its Ultra last longer than the Pro? I can only think of one option.</p>

<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS hybrid interface</a> debuted with the 100-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, but any watch can use it. Without diving into minutiae, Wear OS watches can assign background tasks like notifications, watch face data, and heart rate tracking to a low-power co-processor, saving the battery-guzzling tasks for the main processor. </p><p>Almost all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> use a processor and co-processor, but Exynox chips appear to be the exception. The last model&apos;s Exynos W930 chip had dual Cortex-A55 cores, for instance; compare that to the Pixel Watch 2&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a>, which has four Cortex-A53 cores <em>and</em> a 22nm Cortex M55 co-processor. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung watches are fast and long-lasting, but it needs to prove the Galaxy Watch Ultra will still be "premium" four years from now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung watches have excellent, efficient performance speed. Transitioning to a power-saving hybrid system might be harder for Samsung and its Exynos division than its Qualcomm-reliant rivals. </p><p>Maybe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-rumored-to-receive-3nm-exynos-chip">rumored Exynos W940</a> could change that; it&apos;s supposed to be 50% more efficient. But Samsung could easily cancel out that efficiency with more RAM to achieve Ultra-quality speed. </p><p>The other (unlikely) option is for Samsung to add a secondary grayscale screen that kicks in whenever the battery is low. It&apos;s the method used by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 5</a>, and it works really well! But the Samsung display leaks I&apos;ve heard have revolved around squircles or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">micro-LED tech</a>, so I wouldn&apos;t count on it. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qcCd5ckDUrYmVrGWSafDMo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-and-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-on-wrist.jpeg" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) worn on one wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcCd5ckDUrYmVrGWSafDMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Same size and weight, but one has more room for information; can you guess which? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 61g, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 falls on the edge of comfort, thanks to the light nylon strap and reasonably thin titanium case. It also has a 1.9-inch display — squircle-shaped, obviously — which makes reading notifications a breeze. </p><p>Compare that to the 1.5-inch Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which weighs a mere two grams less thanks to its rotating bezel and stainless steel frame. You&apos;d assume that a Galaxy Watch Ultra would have an even <em>larger</em> display to live up to the name, but you&apos;d reach a point where smaller wrists couldn&apos;t bear the weight. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung can (A) go painfully heavy with a rotating bezel, (B) go capacitive despite the drawbacks, or (C) take the Apple/Google route with a crown. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro kept its weight down with its capacitive bezel. When I polled my colleagues, however, they collectively insisted that any Ultra watch would need a better solution — either the rotating bezel or a crown. They&apos;d prioritize useability over comfort. </p><p>Samsung allegedly wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">switch to a squircle Galaxy Watch</a> in the future, but Android watch owners see that as the purview of Apple and its imitators; they might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">hate the switch</a> for its look, even if the square screen makes reading and typing easier. Still, I can&apos;t think of another way to get a bigger display without killing our wrists.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-won-apos-t-let-the-ultra-stand-on-its-own-merits-2">Samsung won&apos;t let the Ultra stand on its own merits</h2>

<p>Samsung likes to make its devices interconnected, the same as Apple. It&apos;s why you need a Samsung phone to check Galaxy Watch ECG readings, or why Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-working-on-supporting-galaxy-ring-on-non-galaxy-phones">"working on"</a> making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> compatible with other non-Galaxy phones.</p><p>That&apos;s probably not going to change with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, even if it <strong>costs</strong> enough to be a standalone device. It&apos;ll probably have built-in cellular data for calling and all the health sensors in the world — maybe even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">blood sugar monitoring</a> — but Samsung will still want you to analyze your data on its phone.</p><p>Naturally, die-hard Samsung fans with disposable income will buy a Galaxy Watch Ultra with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultras</a>, because they want the best possible tech at all times — the same with Apple Watch Ultra 2 buyers. The question is whether Samsung can step outside of that niche, and what kind of value it can offer besides "big battery, big screen." </p>

<p>In the future, AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will be the backbone of wearable tech, giving you a natural way to access information or send replies without being dependent on a tiny screen. However, the rough launches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humanes-ai-pin-will-work-with-google-photos-and-contacts">Humane AI pin</a> prove how far off that future is. </p><p>Thankfully, there&apos;s another "AI" option Samsung can take. </p>
<h2 id="samsung-apos-s-ultra-path-ahead-is-health-and-fitness-2">Samsung&apos;s Ultra path ahead is health and fitness</h2>
<p>Aside from Apple nerds, one type of person consistently buys smartwatches in the $500–$1,000 range: athletes, gym rats, and fitness freaks. </p><p>That&apos;s why Apple started going all-out on fitness the year the Ultra came out, focusing on runners, hikers, and cyclists. It targeted people who would normally spend a grand on premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> like the Epix or Fenix. </p><p>Serious athletes won&apos;t settle for any traditional smartwatch because they need weeks of battery life, not days. However, Apple still won over the weekend warrior types who want solid fitness features when they have time but better smarts and apps during the week. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVe5iP465jbv2v3FyU5nb8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-activity.jpeg" alt="A walking activity on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVe5iP465jbv2v3FyU5nb8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve been harping on Samsung&apos;s lack of fitness progress over the last couple of years. To its credit, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro did add offline GPX maps, a popular feature on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>. However, it took them until last year to add heart rate zones, and Samsung still lags behind in areas like GPS accuracy and daily readiness. </p><p>Samsung will take a stride forward for health tracking this summer with the Galaxy Ring, which will give you a daily "Vitality Score" based on your sleep quality. Samsung will call it an "AI" tool, but it&apos;s basically the same algorithm other fitness watch brands have used for the last few years. </p><p>The next step is to incorporate workout data and your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> level to determine how long to recover after a workout or how many active workout minutes you need that day to get fitter safely. It&apos;s the key feature Garmin and Fitbit watches offer, and I&apos;ve no doubt Apple is working on its own version. </p><p>Even if some people only want the Galaxy Watch Ultra to be as RAM-packed, long-lasting, and massive as possible, Samsung can&apos;t escape the fact that plenty of people see watches as a training tool or health tracker, first and foremost. Beyond the Android super-fans, no one will buy an "Ultra" watch that doesn&apos;t go above and beyond for fitness software. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung has supposedly paused the rollout of One UI 6.1 with Galaxy AI features for the Galaxy S22 series in South Korea due to a bug.</li><li>Some users in South Korea have apparently experienced various issues, including a persistent white screen after unlocking and non-responsive touchscreens on the lock screen.</li><li>Despite the issues with the Galaxy S22, the update is still being pushed to other older flagship models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 6.1 with Galaxy AI features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> series in South Korea, but the company has apparently paused it due to a  bug.</p><p>A number of Galaxy S22 owners in South Korea have hit a snag with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/one_ui_61_update_for_galaxy_s22_series_halted_due_to_a_bug-news-62714.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Apparently, there’s a glitch where the screen turns white and stays that way after unlocking the phone, rendering it unusable.</p><p>Moreover, some Galaxy S22 users took to Samsung&apos;s Korean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s22%EC%8B%9C%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%88-oneui6-1%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%A4%91%EB%8B%A8/td-p/26784457" target="_blank">community forums</a> to report that the touchscreen isn’t working on the lock screen after the update. The only fix seems to be a factory reset.</p><p>That said, it looks like owners of older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung flagship models</a> that were slated to receive the update  have nothing to worry about. Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/one-ui-61-testing-on-older-samsung-models">recent update was released for several devices</a> like the Galaxy S21, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Flip 4, and the Z Fold 3 and Flip 3, the rollout has only been paused for the Galaxy S22 series.</p><p>Samsung hasn&apos;t officially recognized the bug yet, but it seems it has pulled the One UI 6.1 firmware back in its home turf. If you haven&apos;t updated your Galaxy S22 yet, you&apos;ll need to hold off for the next firmware release, which should address all the reported issues.</p><p>The bug hasn&apos;t popped up on the other older Galaxy devices yet, so the update is still rolling out for those models.</p><p>The big deal about the latest One UI release is Galaxy AI, which brings a bunch of AI-powered features from the Galaxy S24 to older Samsung flagships. These cool features include Circle to Search with Google, Chat Assist, Live Translate, Note Assist, Browsing Assist, AI-generated wallpapers, and more.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached out to Samsung for clarification and will update this post once we hear back from the company.</p><p>Samsung is probably heading back to square one to fix the bug. Once that&apos;s sorted, it&apos;ll probably restart the update rollout and hopefully extend it to more territories.</p>

It doesn't have media streaming or any of the software features that you get with most other NAS servers, but if you just need local storage, it is ideal.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a> is still the best home NAS around, and that isn&apos;t likely to change anytime soon. It&apos;s not a single thing that gives the DS224+ an edge; instead, it&apos;s a combination of hardware, software features, and positioning. The hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment as it doesn&apos;t have any 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports or M.2 SSD slots, but those are minor limitations that ultimately have a bearing in daily use.</p><p>That said, the rest of the hardware is terrific; the DS224+ is powered by the Intel Celeron J4125, and it is the default choice for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS servers</a>. It even has the ability to transcode Plex content, making it that much more enticing. So if you have a large media library and want to set up a NAS, you should pick up the DS224+. The 2-bay NAS has 2GB of RAM out of the box, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.</p><p>The biggest differentiator for the DS224+ is the software; the DiskStation Manager interface has a polished design and plenty of features, and best of all, it&apos;s easy to use. You can set up Synology Photos and have a Google Photos alternative that stores data in your own house, and the utility by itself makes the DS224+ worthy. In a similar vein, you can back up data from just about any device automatically, access your media library when you&apos;re away from your home, and a whole lot more.</p><p>Ultimately, the DS224+ has the requisite hardware and software to truly stand out, and it is an easy choice if you need a powerful home NAS server.</p>

This is also a 2-bay NAS, but it doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of hardware; it is powered by a Realtek RTD1619B chip, has 1GB of memory, and a single Gigabit Ethernet port at the back.</p><p>The upside is that it costs under $200, and that makes it highly enticing. You still get most of the software features that are present in the DS224+, and while you miss out on containerization and virtual machines, those aren&apos;t features that make a difference to home users anyway.</p><p>While there are plenty of budget NAS servers, I always recommend the DS223j for the proven software. It is significantly easier to use, and Synology&apos;s mobile apps allow you to stream your media from anywhere in the world. And the best part is that it has a native Plex client, so you can set up a media server without any issues.</p><p>If you just need a NAS to store data in a single location and stream media on a budget, the DS223j is the best choice available today.</p>

<p>You need a reliable way to store photos and valuable data, but don&apos;t want to invest in a full-fledged NAS. That&apos;s where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-beestation-4tb-review">BeeStation</a> comes in; this is an all-in-one unit that houses a 4TB hard drive (a HAT3300 Plus), so you can get started straight away. The goal with the BeeStation is to target consumers that don&apos;t yet have a NAS and are looking to get affordable local storage that&apos;s connected to the network.</p><p>Therefore, you don&apos;t get a lot of software features; there&apos;s the ability to back up photos and videos, and files from any of your connected machines. That&apos;s it. You don&apos;t get the usual DiskStation Manager software, and the interface is as barebones as it can get. That said, the BeePhotos mobile client makes it easy to back up photos and videos, and in the four months that I used the BeeStation, it has proven to be reliable.</p><p>The biggest limitation is the lack of media streaming. You can store your media library on the device, but you can&apos;t do much with it. The BeeStation is instead designed as a private cloud solution; instead of storing photos and documents on Google Drive and other public cloud providers, the idea is that you back it up to this device.</p><p>To that effect, the BeeStation integrates with Google Drive and other storage providers, and you can transfer the data from those services to the BeeStation easily. So if you need an easy way to back up photos and videos and don&apos;t need many additional features, the BeeStation is a good choice.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR is doing all the right things with its home NAS servers, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">AS5402T</a> is a testament to how far the brand has come in the last two years. The 2-bay NAS has the best hardware package in this category; it is powered by Intel&apos;s Celeron J5105, has 4GB of RAM with the ability to upgrade to 16GB, four M.2 slots in total, two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports.</p><p>There&apos;s also an HDMI port at the back that lets you connect the AS5402T to a TV, and the Intel hardware makes the NAS a standout choice if you need a powerful Plex server. It easily handles transcodes and playback without any issues, and in my testing, it did a better job than just about any other 2-bay NAS.</p><p>But it&apos;s the connectivity that allows it to stand out; with two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, the AS5402T is future-proof, and you don&apos;t need to switch to another NAS when you upgrade your home network. ASUSTOR&apos;s software still isn&apos;t as polished or easy to use, but it has gotten better over the last two years, and it comes with much better security this time around.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds423-plus-review">DiskStation DS423+</a> is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-ds920-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS920+</a>, but there are a few minor changes. It is powered by the Intel Celeron J4125, has 2GB of RAM, four drive bays that hold a total of 72TB of storage, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two M.2 slots that allows you to add SSD storage.</p><p>In short, the DS423+ is the go-to choice if you need a powerful Plex media server. I prefer it to the DiskStation DS923+ as it comes with the ability to handle Plex transcodes, and that is its biggest advantage. It does a fantastic job playing back high bitrate 4K content via Plex or any other media streaming solution, and the four drive bays give you plenty of room to upgrade drives down the line.</p><p>You get the same great software features as the DS224+, and while I would have liked to see multi-Gigabit connectivity, the DS423+ is a great choice nonetheless.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp480t-plus-review">DXP480T Plus</a> is a unique NAS in that it doesn&apos;t have traditional hard drive bays — you instead get four M.2 2280 slots to house SSDs. The all-flash NAS is aimed at enthusiasts, and if you don&apos;t want to use mechanical drives and are instead looking to go all in on SSD storage, this is the best choice.</p><p>The biggest differentiator for the DXP480T Plus is the hardware; it has a 12th Gen Intel Core i5-1235U combined with 8GB of RAM, 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity at the back, and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity as well. The hardware is overkill for most home usage scenarios, but if you have a lot of valuable data and need blazing-fast transfers, the DXP480T Plus is in a league of its own.</p><p>UGREEN hasn&apos;t sorted out the software just yet, but that&apos;s set to change by the end of May, and that is when the DXP480T Plus will be available in general sale. Until then, you can get it for a lot less than its retail price via the crowdfunded route.</p><p>I&apos;m still partial to mechanical HDDs, but having used the DXP480T Plus extensively, I will admit that the all-flash NAS is a terrific choice if you want to move to SSD storage.</p>

<p>As a NAS server is designed to run 24/7, you can&apos;t use a standard hard drive. Thankfully, there are drives designed just for NAS use, and I&apos;ve rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best hard drives for NAS</a> in a standalone article. </p><p>At a high-level overview, you&apos;ll need to buy either Seagate&apos;s IronWolf or IronWolf Pro series or Western Digital&apos;s Red Plus or Red Pro hard drives. I&apos;ve used all of these drives for nearly a decade now, and they&apos;ve proven to be reliable. </p><p>If I had to suggest a drive for home use, it would be the Seagate IronWolf. I have over 50TB of IronWolf drives in various servers, and it is hands-down the most reliable NAS drive that I have used. It starts off at 2TB and goes up to 18TB, and for home use, anything over 4TB should be an ideal choice. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> might still be months away from launch, but some phone case manufacturers aren&apos;t wasting any time ensuring that their products are ready for when Google eventually launches its next flagship phones.

<p>Last year, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, Google flattened the display entirely but kept the rounded edges all around the sides of the phone. The Pixel 9 is rumored to received further flattening, making the side rails completely flat. These Thinborne cases help show off how flat those sides could be if this design turns out to be true.</p><p>The corners don&apos;t seem to have changed at all from the Pixel 8 series, suggesting that Google isn&apos;t looking to square up its next-generation phones — just flatten the sides.</p>

<p>Additionally, these cases could help back up rumors that Google will release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-base-rendering-xl-leak">three Pixel 9 models</a>: a base Google Pixel 9, a beefed up Pixel 9 Pro that&apos;s a similar size to the Pixel 9, and a Pixel 9 Pro XL that features the Pro&apos;s beefed-up specs inside a larger chassis.</p><p>Based on the cases, the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro could be as small as the Pixel 7a, which is pictured alongside the Thinborne Pixel 9 Pro case above.</p><p>These cases also seem to corroborate a rumor that the Pixel 9 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-display-rumor">will be slightly taller</a> than the Pixel 8 Pro, the most comparable model that currently exists.</p>

<p>Again, take this with a grain of salt for now since Google has not officially unveiled the Pixel 9 design. However, if these cases turn out to be fully accurate and fit the final retail models of the Pixel 9, they would likely set a new record for phone accessories availability ahead of a phone&apos;s official announcement.</p><p>Google phones have a history of being leaked far ahead of their official announcement, but even this is incredibly early for live cases and accessories to make their way to Amazon&apos;s virtual shelves. As it stands, we don&apos;t expect Google to announce a Pixel 9 series until the first week of October if the company&apos;s track record of fall announcements continues into 2024.</p>
