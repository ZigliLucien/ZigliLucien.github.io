<ul><li>Qualcomm unveils a new entry-level Snapdragon chipset for budget Android phones.</li><li>It aims to make 5G accessible for the masses, with speeds of up to 1Gbps.</li><li>The latest SoC will be adopted by major OEMs, including Xiaomi, which will make it the first commercially available device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is introducing a new Snapdragon chipset designed for lower-cost Android phones to boost their 5G speeds. The Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 is a toned-down version of last year&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 2.</p><p>The latest Snapdragon 4 series chipset promises Gigabit 5G connectivity, as well as improved performance, battery life, and camera features. The emphasis is on 5G, with the chipset maker offering speeds of up to 1Gbps, which will power upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">entry-level Android phones</a>.</p>
<p>Qualcomm claims in a press release that it is seven times faster than current LTE phones on the market. However, the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-4-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 4 Gen 2</a>, which also caters to entry-level handsets, has download speeds of up to 2.5Gbps.</p><p>"The Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 Mobile Platform is a significant leap forward in making 5G technology more accessible, so more people can navigate the world at 5G speeds," Chris Patrick, senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets at Qualcomm, stated during the chipset announcement.</p><p>On the performance front, the 4m Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 features two performance cores with clock speeds of up to 2GHz and six efficient cores with clock speeds of 1.8GHz. The new chipset improves photography by supporting up to 80MP single-shot capture while also providing video image stabilization and multi-frame noise reduction capabilities.</p>

<p>The new chipset promises users an all-day battery life as well as support for 40W fast charging, including Qualcomm&apos;s Quick Charge 4 Plus technology. Other notable features of the entry-level Qualcomm chipset include support for Full HD+ displays with 90Hz refresh rates, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.1, and AI-powered audio improvements.</p><p>Finally, Qualcomm notes that major OEMs will use the new Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 this year for upcoming low-cost Android phones, with Xiaomi expected to be the first to announce a new phone with the latest chipset.</p>

<ul><li>The One UI 7 beta, originally believed to be rolled out on July 29, has been reportedly delayed.</li><li>Industry insiders suggest the delay is due to ongoing development of One UI 6.1.1 and stability issues with One UI 7.</li><li>Samsung seems to be prioritizing the release of One UI 6.1.1 across compatible devices before launching One UI 7.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The One UI 7 beta was supposed to release today, July 29, but it seems the rollout has been pushed back.</p><p>Several reliable sources are saying that Samsung&apos;s One UI 7 update (based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> users is getting delayed, as per a post on X by SamMobile.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is anticipated that there will be a delay in the release of the One UI 7 beta.The One UI 7 beta was originally scheduled to be announced on Monday.

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1817920173061423569" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a> chimed in and backed up this claim, saying that Samsung is likely delaying the beta launch because the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delay-one-ui-6-1-1-ai">still working on and about to release One UI 6.1.1 for the same devices</a>.</p><p>The South Korean tech giant plans to focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">rolling out One UI 6.1.1 to all compatible devices</a> before starting the One UI 7 beta release.</p><p>Jambor explains the delay by pointing to information from reliable sources, Ice Universe and chunvn8888. They claim that One UI 7 is facing a lot of stability issues right now, which is likely why the release has, in part, been pushed back.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Samsung for a statement and will update this article when we receive a response.</p><p>Samsung rolled out One UI 6.1.1 earlier this month, mainly to bring advanced AI features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. Alongside these upgrades, there are also some tweaks to boost productivity and media features across the Galaxy devices.</p><p>Despite this potential delay, Samsung seems to be ahead of its overall One UI development schedule. For context, the first beta for One UI 6 was released on August 11 last year. So, it&apos;s likely that the One UI 7 launch might also get pushed back to a similar timeframe.</p><p>When One UI 7 eventually rolls out to the public or beta testers, it&apos;s set to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">bring a major revamp to the Samsung user experience</a>. One of the standout changes is expected to be a complete makeover of the camera interface. Rumor has it that Samsung will shift key camera controls, such as shooting modes, quick adjustments, and zoom functions, to the lower part of the screen for easier access.</p><p>One UI 7 also seems to be getting a fresh look with rounded design elements and smoother animations. Samsung is also apparently revamping the notification panel with a two-pane setup. This means your notifications will be on the left and quick settings on the right.</p>

<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is apparently rolling out a new feature that lets users quickly react to messages with a double-tap, similar to Instagram and Facebook Messenger.</p><p>Since Meta took over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, the app has been gradually woven into Meta&apos;s larger social media family. This strategic move has created a more connected and seamless experience for users. The new feature coming up could make messaging even smoother across all these apps.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-a-new-double-tap-message-reaction-feature-for-android-beta/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a> discovered the upcoming feature by digging through the latest WhatsApp beta for Android.</p><p>Double-tapping a message will automatically add a heart emoji, similar to what other messaging apps do. The report says this feature might be mandatory at first, giving users limited control over its use once it&apos;s activated.</p><p>Right now, reacting to messages on WhatsApp requires a long press to bring up the reaction menu. From there, users can pick an emoji from a set list or tap the plus icon for more options.</p><p>The new feature aims to make expressing emotions quicker with a simple double-tap that sends a heart emoji. While this quick response option makes reacting faster, you&apos;ll still need to use the usual long press to open the full reaction menu if you want to use different emojis.</p>

<p>More <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular Android messaging apps</a> are adding double-tap reaction features too. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>, for example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1760210749287244099" target="_blank">introduced this in February</a>, allowing users to quickly give a thumbs-up with a double-tap. This was a big deal because it worked with both RCS and SMS messaging.</p><p>Besides the upcoming double-tap reaction, WhatsApp has been spotted working on adding a dedicated reaction button in its media viewer. Located next to the reply button, this new button lets users quickly choose from six preset reactions. If you want more options, there&apos;s a plus icon for a wider emoji selection. This feature is currently being tested with some WhatsApp beta users, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-new-media-reaction-and-reply-shortcuts-on-android-beta/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>.</p><p>WhatsApp&apos;s own double-tap reaction feature for messages is still in development, and it remains unclear when it becomes available to everyone, let alone for beta testing.</p>

<p>Obviously $650 is a lot to spend on a tablet, but when you consider that that's the price <em>after</em> a $450 Best Buy discount, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra</a> suddenly becomes an appealing prospect. </p>
<p>Despite being a last-gen device, the Tab S8 Ultra is supremely powerful, with an efficient Snapdragon chipset, a huge 14.6-inch AMOLED display, and an included S Pen stylus. Throw in a keyboard attachment and you're essentially getting a versatile, high-performance Samsung laptop at a huge discount. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-14-6-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6494238.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1f36d389-5133-4657-aeb7-4fecd30c454f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra 128GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra 128GB: $1,099.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<ul><li>A report from South Korea states that Samsung's "Slim" Fold 6 won't be as thin as you might've expected.</li><li>The device is reportedly dropping to 11.6mm, down from 12.1mm of the Fold 6 as an executive states Samsung was concerned about product "reliability."</li><li>The Fold 6 "Slim" is rumored to feature an 8-inch internal display, and a 6.5-inch cover display, and will likely see the removal of the S Pen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There&apos;s been talk about Samsung creating a "slim" variant of the latest Galaxy Z Fold 6, but a new report claims it won&apos;t be a <em>vast </em>size reduction.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=29307">The Elec</a> (Korean), Samsung is reportedly in the process of "finalizing" its decision regarding the appropriate thickness (or thinness) of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a> variant (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/29/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-thickness-report/">9to5Google</a>). Supposedly, the Fold 6 Slim will arrive at 11.6mm in thickness, which is only a slight 5% drop from the 12.1mm measurement of the Fold 6 when folded.</p><p>Though this is a moderate change, the report states Samsung grappled with "product reliability" when deciding how to make the device thinner.</p><p>The digitizers (responsible for the S Pen) of the Fold 6 Slim were removed to cut down on its thickness. However, it was stated that "applying expensive, thin internal materials" could not only raise the device&apos;s price but also compromise its reliability.</p><p>A Samsung executive stated, "even if Samsung wanted to release the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim model, it will be difficult to do so into the 10mm range due to the reliability issues." It&apos;s reported that such issues refer to the survivability and longevity of its hinge and various resistances. Moreover, it seems Samsung is playing it safe with this rumored 11.6mm size to avoid "risks."</p><p>The company executive reportedly mentioned popular Chinese brands like Honor and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Magic V3 foldable phones</a>, which are very slim. The Magic V3 launched earlier in July with a 9.2mm thickness when folded and 4.3mm unfolded.</p><p>Aside from quality control, Samsung has supposedly started mass-producing the general materials required for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim.</p>

<p>Early rumors of a "Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-fold-6-slim-expected-to-launch-in-2025">claimed the device</a> would miss out on one important feature: the S Pen. Considering the pen is stored in the device, it makes sense that such an item would get the boot. The Slim model was also rumored to offer a slightly larger display, too. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaks-suggest-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-might-be-worth-waiting-for">following report</a> claimed the device could sport an 8-inch display, which would beat the Fold 6&apos;s 7.6-inch display.</p><p>The cover display would also benefit, potentially arriving at 6.5-inches. Moreover, it&apos;s been rumored that the device&apos;s run may be limited to around 500,000 units. Samsung&apos;s launch of the Slim model in the U.S. is also uncertain.</p><p>Additional rumors state the company could launch the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-slim-rumor-mill">in Q4 2024</a>. That could put us right around October if anything.</p>

<p><em><strong>Michael asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Is there a way to filter text messages based on keywords, or auto-filter spammy texts besides just putting all unknown numbers in a folder? I get about 5-10 political texts from different numbers per day and it&apos;d sure be nice to block them by keywords.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Ugh. I&apos;m sure about 200 million Americans with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a> feel your pain and I&apos;ll wager as many people around the world also get unsolicited political messages and hate it. They prove that a by-product of tech innovation is that spamming people is super easy and must be profitable. Nobody would do it if it wasn&apos;t working to make money.</p><p>Unfortunately, they&apos;ll probably be getting worse in the U.S. in the next few months as the 2024 elections draw near. And it sucks that there&apos;s no easy way to stop it.</p>
<p>I always want to front-load the answer for people who aren&apos;t going to read down the page and I wish the answer was better news:</p><p>On both Android and iOS, it&apos;s easy to search through all of your messages by a specific keyword, but you can&apos;t block them or automatically filter them using a keyword. It&apos;s an omission that seems like an oversight; this <em>should</em> be there and it&apos;s not.</p><p>You can filter out all messages from unknown numbers but that&apos;s not the same thing and may affect things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor codes</a> or legitimate messages from mail carriers or emergency services.</p>
<p>I do want to say that I have found putting my number on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">National Do Not Call Registry</a> seems to have lessened the number of messages I get asking for donations. I still get them and I&apos;m not sure of any side effect of putting my phone number on yet another government list but I get fewer of them than I have in the past using the same number. Or maybe it&apos;s the placebo effect.</p>

<p>With Google putting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-google-messages">Gemini into messaging</a> and Apple doing the same with Siri it would be a great thing each could do. Cross-checking a list of words to a filtering tool is one of those things that AI would be exceptionally good at and many people would find it helpful. Maybe it will come in a future update.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve been told there are third-party apps that have this ability. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.android.smsorganizer&hl=en_US">SMS Organizer</a> was recommended as one but I&apos;ll admit I&apos;ve not tried any. Since the functions are built into the messaging system I don&apos;t see any reason why they shouldn&apos;t work as advertised but I will warn you to check the app&apos;s permissions closely.</p><p>A search could be done on the device and any filtering should also stay on the device, but with any third-party app, you&apos;re using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/on-privacy">personal data as payment</a> so it&apos;s always worth checking what a company is collecting.</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar enough with iOS to know about any apps with this feature and the web isn&apos;t much help because it only wants to tell me how great filtering unknown numbers on your iPhone is. Maybe someone will comment with more info. </p><p>In the meantime, we just have to block them one by one unless we want to use a third-party app.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy S25 Ultra might not see a battery upgrade, sticking with a 5,000mAh capacity and 45W charging.</li><li>The S25 Ultra's rumored slimmer design could explain the lack of battery improvement, as fitting a larger battery in a thinner phone is challenging.</li><li>Despite no battery upgrade, the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor could improve battery life due to better power efficiency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is shaping up to be another example of Samsung&apos;s battery complacency.</p><p>Often-reliable leaker Ice Universe shared on X that Samsung is expected to ship its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> successor with the same battery capacity and charging speeds as its previous top-of-the-line variants.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Galaxy S25 Ultra still has 5000mAh+45w, what do you think?<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1816405433177022735">July 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This means the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to stick with a 5,000mAh battery (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-capacity-charging-speed-leak/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). So, don&apos;t be surprised if its battery life is pretty much the same as the earlier models.</p><p>Sticking with the same battery capacity in the Ultra line while competitors keep innovating weakens the Ultra brand&apos;s image as a tech leader. Keeping this up in 2025 doesn&apos;t match what you&apos;d expect from a flagship device.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also tipped to keep the same 45W fast charging as its predecessor. While that&apos;s better than Apple&apos;s offerings, it still falls short compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">fan-favorite Android phones</a> pushing past 100W charging speeds.</p><p>When the Galaxy S20 Ultra debuted in 2020, its 5,000mAh battery and 45W charging set a new standard for flagship phones. These features were passed down to the Galaxy S21 and S22 Ultra. Unfortunately, it seems the Galaxy S25 Ultra will continue this trend without any battery upgrades.</p><p>Nevertheless, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1806496984968364327" target="_blank">rumored slimmer design</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra might explain the lack of battery improvements. Fitting a larger battery into a thinner phone while keeping its advanced camera system and other internal components is a tough engineering challenge.</p><p>Even without a battery capacity upgrade, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to deliver better battery life than its predecessor. Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor, built with TSMC&apos;s advanced 3nm technology, the phone should be more power-efficient, allowing for longer usage on a single charge.</p><p>Previous rumors also suggested that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">Samsung might use AI to enhance battery performance</a>. However, it&apos;s wise to take these claims with a grain of salt at the moment, as the Galaxy S25 Ultra&apos;s official release is still several months away.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re eagerly awaiting Google&apos;s next smartwatch launch, but a new leak has seemingly ripped the cover off what&apos;s in store.</p><p>According to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-3-band-colors">Android Headlines</a> report, the Pixel Watch 3 will be offered in six different bands alongside a few body color choices. It&apos;s rumored that the device will be offered in Matte Black Aluminum (Obsidian band) and Polished Silver (Porcelain band) for its 41 and 45mm variants. The larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">rumored 45mm version</a> may grab a Matte Hazel Aluminum body (Hazel band).</p><p>The smaller choice will reportedly grab a Champagne Gold Aluminum case (Hazel band) and a Polished Silver Aluminum body (Rose Quartz band).</p><p>The post states the 41mm version of the device will feature a Stretch Band in Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, Sage, Wintergreen, and Rose Quartz. A Metal Mesh band is also rumored, featured in Matte Black, Champagne Gold, and Polished Silver.</p><p>A Metal Slim band will reportedly arrive in Matte Black, Champagne Gold, and Brushed Silver. Charcoal, Porcelain, and Bay are rumored for the supposed Two-tone Leather band option.</p><p>The rest of the rumored bands and associated color options for both sizes are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Active </strong>— Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel</li><li><strong>Active Sport </strong>— Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, Coral, Moondust, Wintergreen</li><li><strong>Woven </strong>— Ivy, Porcelain, Lemongrass, Peony, Bay (41mm), Sage (41mm)</li><li><strong>Metal Links </strong>— Matte Black, Brushed Silver</li><li><strong>Crafted Leather </strong>— Obsidian, Moondust</li><li><strong>Performance Loop </strong>— Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, Wintergreen</li></ul>

<p>Rumors have floated around, but it seems that the Pixel Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">isn&apos;t staring at any radical design changes</a>. A batch of supposed renderings surfaced in June and it&apos;s rumored that the device will be thicker to accommodate a bigger battery. Aside from that, the device&apos;s imagery still suggests the same domed-glass display, a rotating crown, and a physical trigger button for the Assistant.</p><p>Additionally, rumors of a "Pixel Watch 3 XL" cropped up again after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-xl-renders">a few renders appeared</a>. While the design remains the same as the Watch 3, the 3 XL may feature a 1.45-inch display. That&apos;s only slightly larger than the rumored 1.2-inch display of the Pixel Watch 3. Moreover, speculation claims that the XL version will be even thicker and potentially outfitted with expanded battery capacity and more health/fitness sensors.</p><p>What&apos;s more, a report from a week ago claims that the Pixel Watch 3&apos;s prices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/forget-budget-friendly-the-pixel-watch-3-price-rumors-are-brutal">are nothing short of brutal</a>. Regardless, we&apos;re approaching Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">early hardware event</a> on August 13, where we should see everything for ourselves.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted developing three new extensions for its AI model Gemini to bring better hands-free control to users.</li><li>One extension involves Google Home so users can control all connected devices and homes on their account through Gemini.</li><li>Google has continuously given Gemini the bulk of its Assistant's functionality in its push to phase it out on Android devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted working on a few new extensions for Gemini, and a deep dive into its app&apos;s code details what&apos;s to come.</p><p>The deep dive conducted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug">AssembleDebug</a> in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-extensions-leaks-3465539/">Android Authority</a> unearthed signs of three new Gemini extensions. Discovered within beta version v15.29.34.29 of the Google app were clues about a Google Home AI extension. The tipster was able to get its permissions to show, which stated users can "manage and control all homes and devices that this Google account has access to."</p><p>A couple of examples of what Gemini can control include lights and switches. Additionally, the publication states this swap to make Gemini an eligible controller of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-home-compatible-devices">smart home devices</a> will streamline the process. Currently, Android requires the use of Google Assistant, but this would remove that slight hiccup.</p><p>Gemini&apos;s upcoming Home extension mentions that some of your data will be shared with the company if it&apos;s included in "your conversation." However, this is an opt-in feature, so users can leave it disabled if they choose.</p>

<p>Another interesting extension in development is called "Utilities." Surfacing the feature shows that this could let Gemini control certain aspects of your Android phone. The brief description says it can "take photos" and "open apps," among others when Utilities is enabled.</p><p>Lastly, another extension will seemingly let Gemini assist with your phone calls. Called "Phone," Gemini may soon gain the ability to call someone you desire through a simple prompt. The publication speculates users will be able to type "Call (name of the person)" to get it working.</p><p>Google started widely rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">Gemini&apos;s extensions</a> for its app in April. This allowed users to leverage data in other apps like Gmail, YouTube, Flights, Hotels, and more. Of course, this is part of the company&apos;s plans to continuously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-gemini-mean-for-google-assistant">phase out its Assistant</a> in favor of its smarter, multimodal AI model. The extensions spotted in the recent app beta show that Google is giving Gemini the ability to handle tasks that previously required the Assistant.</p><p>Another find earlier this month showed Google&apos;s plans to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-beta-gemini-lock-screen-ai-detailed">Gemini to Android&apos;s lock screen</a> alongside the ability to utilize extensions.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear when these extensions will arrive, though it might be soon. Google is preparing for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event</a> on August 13, which will host new products like the Pixel 9 series. It&apos;s not outlandish to theorize that what&apos;s next for Gemini will make an appearance.</p>

<ul><li>T-Mobile, which has called itself the “Un-carrier” and sold cellular plans with lifetime Price Lock guarantees, announced in May that it would be raising the price of all plans — new and old.</li><li>The move understandably irritated subscribers who were told their rates would never change, and they filed complaints with the FCC.</li><li>After T-Mobile dismissed the complaints, users filed a class-action lawsuit against the company that will challenge its recent decisions in court.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> has had somewhat of a fall of grace over the last few years, becoming one of the same giant conglomerate carriers that it originally vowed to beat. The quality of its services is arguably better than ever — T-Mobile has been grabbing up as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-t-mobile-everything-you-need-know">5G spectrum coverage</a> as it can, and it’s showing in real-world performance. However, T-Mobile also started to roll out some anti-consumer policies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-announces-us-cellular-acquisition">and big acquisitions</a>. Most recently, it announced price hikes that even extended to the Price Lock plans. </p><p>For those unfamiliar, Price Lock plans at T-Mobile had the unique caveat of offering no price increases, <em>ever</em>. That’s rare in the cellular industry, and it’s partially why T-Mobile grew so fast. People loved the idea of subscribing to a cellular plan and never having to worry about their rates changing over time. Often, these types of deals and promotions have caveats in the fine print. But in this case, T-Mobile clearly stated what it was offering in the introductory press release for Price Lock plans:</p><p>“With the Un-contract, T-Mobile signs, and customers hold all the power. Now, T-Mobile ONE customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it,“ the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/un-carrier-next" target="_blank"> press release</a> said. “T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile ONE plan. When you sign up for T-Mobile ONE, only YOU have the power to change the price you pay.” </p><p>There was no nonsense in the footnotes of that press release, or the fine print. It was simple: if you subscribed to select T-Mobile plans, your rates would never change. Or so users thought, because T-Mobile tossed that notion aside when it announced price hikes between $2 to $5 per plan, per line for all users in May 2024. It would seem that this move violated T-Mobile&apos;s Price Lock and Un-Contract obligations, but the company didn’t think so. It brushed off the FCC complaints with a standard letter that rejected notions that it did something wrong (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2024/06/t-mobile-responds-to-fcc-complaints-about-price-increases/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>).</p><p>The letter did tell us that, at least internally, T-Mobile sorts Price Lock plans into at least two groups, which customers are calling Price Lock 1.0 and Price Lock 2.0. The Price Lock 1.0 plans cover users who subscribed between April 28th, 2022, and Jan. 17th, 2024, whereas the 2.0 version covers anyone who subscribed after Jan. 17th, 2024. This is important context, because Price Lock 2.0 subscribers are affected by the price hikes, but Price Lock 1.0 subscribers aren’t. </p><p>The burning question is how subscribers who bought into the Price Lock plans <em>before </em>April 28th, 2022 are affected by T-Mobile’s price hikes. The company hasn’t made that clear so far, and the answer may determine whether T-Mobile’s changes will hold up. </p>

<p>T-Mobile users aren’t waiting to find out, though. A group of customers have already filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-class-action-lawsuit-lifetime-price-guarantee/" target="_blank">Wired</a>. </p><p>Right now, there are only four class members, representing New Jersey, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. However, they’re looking to expand that to include all United States residents "who entered into a T-Mobile One Plan, Simple Choice plan, Magenta, Magenta Max, Magenta 55+, Magenta Amplified or Magenta Military Plan with T-Mobile which included a promised lifetime price guarantee but had their price increased without their consent and in violation of the promises made by T-Mobile and relied upon by Plaintiffs and the proposed class.”</p><p>The class action suit directly challenges T-Mobile’s move to increase the rates of the Price Lock plan, arguing that the company did not have customer consent to do so under the terms of the initial agreement.</p><p>"Based upon T-Mobile&apos;s representations that the rates offered with respect to certain plans were guaranteed to last for life or as long as the customer wanted to remain with that plan, each Plaintiff and the Class Members agreed to these plans for wireless cellphone service from T-Mobile," according to the filing. “However, in May 2024, T-Mobile unilaterally did away with these legacy phone plans and switched Plaintiffs and the Class to more expensive plans without their consent.”</p><p>This lawsuit was just filed earlier this month, and it’s in its early stages. However, from the outside looking in, it seems cut and dry. T-Mobile flaunted its Price Lock guarantee for years, saying that users will never get unwanted price increases. Regardless of how this suit pans out, I think it’ll set a precedent for future companies, and could dictate how much company promises actually matter. </p><p>For example, there are a few ways this could shake out, and a few questions that need to be answered. Did T-Mobile falsely advertise by touting the Price Lock guarantee, only to break that promise? Are there grounds for T-Mobile to be liable for breach of contract? We’ll leave the answers up to the lawyers and the courts, but they are sure to have an impact on the way companies market and do business.</p><p>Recently, it feels like companies have little accountability for the promises they make. I, for one, am hoping that this T-Mobile class action suit is the catalyst that turns the tide. Customers deserve better treatment, and it’s really as simple as that.</p>
