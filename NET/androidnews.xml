With the schedule now out, we have a glimpse of what will be discussed at the event, including the next version of Wear OS.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS 3</a> marked a resurgence for Google&apos;s Wear OS, and since then, the company has continued to make efforts to improve it. With Wear OS 5 now confirmed to be present at I/O 2024, it seems Google is ready to push to the next major version. This differs from the past few years when the platform went from Wear OS 3 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/one-ui-watch-4-5-based-on-wear-os-3-5-announced">3.5</a> and then to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>. Now, like Apple&apos;s WatchOS platform, Wear OS will apparently start making early version jumps, which is a good sign for the platform.</p><p>What will we see? So far, there&apos;s not much to go on, but Google has hinted at some things, like an update to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a>, which helps developers create more battery-friendly watch faces. But we&apos;ll have to wait and see what else we get when I/O starts.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>It&apos;s finally happened. After years of battling the global phenomenon of TikTok, the U.S. government has issued a bill that is set to ban the app nationwide. After passing through the Senate and House, President Biden signed the bill into law, which gives TikTok owner ByteDance 270 days to sell the app, thus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">cutting it from its ties to the Chinese government</a>. If that doesn&apos;t happen, then Google and Apple will no longer be able to offer the app within their respective app stores.</p><p>TikTok CEO Shou Chew has long defended the company, saying it has spent billions of dollars to protect American data. He took to the platform after the bill was signed, calling it "unconstitutional" and indicating that TikTok plans to fight back.</p><p>There is still plenty of time before the deadline, so this could go either way, but it doesn&apos;t look good for TikTok in the U.S., especially since ByteDance has reportedly indicated that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25/">does not plan to sell the app</a>.</p>

The update now lets users engage in POV-style video calling via WhatsApp and Messenger, but that&apos;s not even the best part.</p><p>With the built-in camera and support for multimodal AI via Meta AI, owners of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses can now ask their glasses questions about what they&apos;re seeing. This includes translating menus, creating recipes, learning more about specific animals or buildings, and much more. It&apos;s like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> on your face, and without having to pull your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>The update is only available in the U.S. and Canada, but it makes an already great pair of smart glasses so much better, notably as we wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-nazare-interview-caitlin-kalinowski">Meta&apos;s next AR glasses</a> to debut sometime in the near-ish future.</p>

Why not? X CEO Linda Yaccarino posted a short video on X showing off a bit of the app, which will be centered on video content, not unlike YouTube. She said the app will be your "go-to companion for a high-quality, immersive entertainment experience on a larger screen" and that it will feature trending videos, enhanced search, and AI-powered topics to help personalize the experience.</p><p>The app will also work across devices, so you should be able to start a video on your phone and continue it on your TV, or you can just cast videos from your phone to the TV if you prefer.</p><p>The app is still in the works, but it will apparently be widely available soon. Does it have what it takes to replace YouTube on your TV? Who knows.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-pulse-series-phones-debut"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Nokia is getting pushed aside as the first HMD Global-branded phones were just launched. The company&apos;s new Pulse lineup consists of three phones that are offered in vibrant colors. The top model is the HMD Pulse Pro, although it offers roughly mid-range/budget specs, likely to keep the price down. It has an HD+ display with a 50MP dual-camera setup, a 5,000mAh battery with 20W charging support, and 6GB of RAM. The phone is powered by a Unisoc chipset and runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with a promise of two OS upgrades (we&apos;re looking at you, Motorola).</p><p>The Pulse Plus and Pulse both also sport HD+ displays, 5,000mAh batteries, and 10W charging, but the Plus gets a 50MP camera, while the Pulse settles for a 13MP shooter. They use the same Unisoc chipset but with 4GB of RAM in addition to 128GB and 64GB of expandable storage for the Plus and Pulse, respectively.</p><p>All phones only support 4G connectivity, which is a little disappointing in 2024, especially for the first HMD-branded phones. The devices also aren&apos;t available in North America at the moment, but a separate HMD Vibe is set to arrive at some point at a very affordable price.</p>

No doubt most Wear OS fans will scoff, since you can get double the battery life for hundreds less with a Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. However, after months of using the Ultra 2, my biggest hope is that we see more Ultra-style Android watches.</p><p>Despite being a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/switching-android-escaping-apple">lifetime iPhone owner</a>, I never used an Apple Watch before the Ultra 2 because the Series watches lacked the battery and fitness tricks to tempt me. But I pestered the Apple PR team for a six-month loan after seeing watchOS&apos; fitness pivot and how the Ultra 2&apos;s dual-frequency GPS gave me confidence it could compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a>.</p><p>Google&apos;s Fitbit acquisition and Samsung&apos;s upcoming pivot to add AI-based "Vitality" data to Samsung Health prove that all mainstream smartwatch brands see fitness as a key foundation. Apple itself hasn&apos;t quite hit the Garmin standard I&apos;m looking for. But I suspect future updates will bring it across the finish line, and its third-party workout apps tip the scales for athletes.</p><p>As is, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 puts pressure on future flagship watches like the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro or Pixel Watch 3 to do more than their predecessors for serious (or casual) athletes.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-watch-ultra-2-price-and-bands"><span>Apple Watch Ultra 2: Price and bands</span></h2>
<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 retails for a whopping $799, double that of the Series 9. Keep in mind, however, that the 45mm stainless steel Series 9 with cellular costs $749 or more (depending on the band type). The 49mm titanium Ultra 2 with built-in LTE doesn&apos;t actually fall far from that premium range.</p><p>Courts briefly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch-9/apples-watch-ban-could-be-a-dollar400-million-mistake-masimo-patent-dispute-could-cost-the-company-big-in-holiday-sales">banned Apple Watch S9 and Ultra 2 sales</a> at the end of 2023 over alleged patent infringement, and Apple&apos;s legal woes are ongoing. For now, Apple will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/tweaking-the-flagship-apple-disables-blood-oxygen-feature-in-new-apple-watches-after-appeals-court-ruling">continue to sell the Ultra 2</a> legally by disabling its blood oxygen feature, circumventing a possible ban.Â </p><p>You have three band options: Trail Loop (Green/Gray, Blue/Black, or Orange/Beige), Alpine Loop (Blue, Indigo, or Olive), or Ocean Band (Blue, White, or Orange).Â </p><p>Of the three, the Trail Loop is our recommended "default" option for most people, as the nylon is comfortable and easily adjustable. The Alpine Loop has a titanium G-Hook that keeps it rigidly secure, which is important for adventurer types but less convenient in everyday scenarios. The Ocean Band is specifically for swimmers, with a water-repelling fluoroelastomer instead of water-absorbant nylon.</p>

But my appreciation isn&apos;t solely because of its size; unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, it&apos;s not just a larger version of the mainline watch. Apple made more purposeful changes to make it feel like a proper flagship.</p><p>Look at the specs sheet above: The dual-band GPS, cellular support for emergency calls without a phone, three-mic array and dual speakers, diving certification, military-grade protection against damage, and action button are all exclusive to the Ultra 2 (unless you buy the cellular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a>).Â </p>

<p>I might never have the chance to use its diving features, but I&apos;ve certainly bonked this chonky watch against all manner of rough surfaces over the past few months, and both the titanium body and sapphire display have come through unscathed.Â </p><p>I tested calls on a windy mountain hike, and my family could barely tell the difference when I switched to my phone, thanks to the three-mic array. On my end, the dual speakers sound less tinny compared to other Bluetooth-enabled watches I&apos;ve worn.Â </p>

<p>The action button, which pulls up the workout menu, is something I instantly took for granted. It&apos;s a far better experience than having to look for the workouts app in my drawer. I simply wish it let you program a second shortcut with a double-tap.</p><p>While I appreciate all of this, it&apos;s just the pleasant seasoning on top of the Ultra 2&apos;s meat-and-potatoes upgrade that no other watch offers: 3,000 nits of brightness on a 1.9-inch display.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cihpJpJai6QNvU5Nvgi2xS" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-widgets.jpeg" alt="Widgets on the Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cihpJpJai6QNvU5Nvgi2xS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone with steadily worsening eyesight, I find the Ultra 2&apos;s full-sized notifications much easier to read than I&apos;m used to with a watch <em>or</em> smartphone. I can glance at the shared photo or the first few lines of an email without moving my wrist from its typing position, then go right back to work unless it&apos;s something relevant.Â </p><p>If it&apos;s important, I can swipe up and see a few quick reply options, all visible because of the squircle design. I know Android watch fans love their circular watches for the design, but the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is so much more useable that it&apos;s hard to go back to round-edged displays that only have room for one thing at a time. It&apos;s why I&apos;m hoping the rumor about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">square-shaped Galaxy Watch</a> is true.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BPbD4YKZ6wi7A6XjVfi6Yd" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-action-button.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Apple Watch Ultra 2's action button and speaker holes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BPbD4YKZ6wi7A6XjVfi6Yd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Series 9, which is functional but boringly consistent, the Ultra 2 feels distinct with its contoured edges carved into titanium. I won&apos;t pretend it isn&apos;t massive, but it&apos;s pleasingly futuristic looking, with every speaker or mic hole giving the surface standing out for some nice texture. And at 14.4mm thick, it&apos;s on par with a flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>Since this is my first Apple Watch, I can&apos;t claim to know whether the Ultra 2 and Series 9 have 30% faster performance over the last generation â courtesy of the first new CPU since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-watch-series-6-review">Series 6</a>. My colleague "didn&apos;t see any noticeable difference" in his Series 9 review, so all I can say is that I&apos;ve rarely spotted lag across months of sporadic use. Apps open, and Siri responds without delay.</p><p>While I&apos;m nowhere close to using up all 64GB of storage, I&apos;d much rather have too much than not enough. I appreciate having the option to save a bunch of audiobooks and music playlists to stream through my AirPods, along with the battery life to play them without risking the watch dying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BCYuaHPTkJXS3ZCbRejWeW" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-nike-run-club.jpeg" alt="A Nike Run Club activity on the Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCYuaHPTkJXS3ZCbRejWeW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This storage space also provides plenty of room for apps. Long-time Apple Watch owners probably take third-party apps for granted, but I don&apos;t. Having access to watchOS apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/workoutdoors/id1241909999?ls=1" target="_blank">WorkOutDoors</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-run-club-running-coach/id387771637" target="_blank">Nike Run Club</a> makes up for any deficiencies with Apple&apos;s on-device software because you can typically find 3rd-party software to fill the gap.Â </p><p>This strays beyond the confines of this review, but I&apos;ll end this section by pointing out that WatchOS seems to have more high-quality apps than Wear OS in key areas â most likely because of Wear OS 3/4&apos;s relative newness and Apple&apos;s wearable sales dominance. I don&apos;t <em>like</em> that Android users get short shrift, but I&apos;ll still point it out.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re spending $799 on a fitness smartwatch, you can expect a certain level of accuracy in your post-run stats. So, how does the Apple Watch 2 Ultra perform compared to a traditional fitness watch like the $599 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a>?Â </p><p>Across several running and hiking activities, I wore both the Ultra 2 and Forerunner 965 so I could compare their GPS tracking, heart rate data, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running dynamics</a> (aka running form stats). We&apos;ll start with this 10K city run below, which had minimal trees or buildings to block the signal; I was surprised to see Apple (orange) beat Garmin (blue):</p>

<p>Garmin usually crushes the competition, but Apple managed to snap to the real-life map better in key areas; in others, Garmin did better, or they both stuck to the trail. Overall, their results were only one-hundredth of a mile apart, whereas a GPS-only watch like the Series 9 wouldn&apos;t do nearly as well.</p><p>Later, during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/altimeter-elevation-test-mt-diablo-with-garmin-apple-coros-polar-galaxy-watch">smartwatch elevation test</a> wearing multiple watches while climbing a mountain, the Ultra 2 came closest to the official Alltrails data, with just an eight-foot difference in total feet climbed and 24 feet higher than the official max elevation.Â </p><p>That being said, looking at the actual GPS line on the hilly, tree-covered trail, the Ultra 2 did slightly worse than the 965; the mileage was only two-hundredths off across 7.5 miles, but you can see how the orange line drifts <em>slightly</em> more off the trail below:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFDszetkAGQn56XtV5SCx3" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-accuracy-test-2.jpeg" alt="A map showing how the Garmin Forerunner 965 and Apple Watch Ultra 2's post-run GPX maps compare for GPS accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFDszetkAGQn56XtV5SCx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most noticeable Apple Watch Ultra 2 difficulty came during a half-marathon trail run, which had dense foliage and clouds. For whatever reason, the Ultra 2 had two moments where it completely lost my positioning â see the straight orange lines on the bottom-right and top-left of the map. I suspect that Apple&apos;s map-correcting algorithm isn&apos;t as reliable for trail runs as it is for city runs.</p><p>Because of this, the Ultra 2 added an extra 0.65 miles to my total, completely skewing the results despite being accurate everywhere else. At one point, it registered me running at 88 miles per hour, which suggests I might be capable of time travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sty5VAVzA4rrtkqRfzgAz4" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-vs-Garmin-Forerunner-965-accuracy-test-5.jpeg" alt="A map showing how the Garmin Forerunner 965 and Apple Watch Ultra 2's post-run GPX maps compare for GPS accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sty5VAVzA4rrtkqRfzgAz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, I&apos;m inclined to believe that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 gives me reliable tracking data and that my latest experience during my half-marathon was an aberration. In normal circumstances, it matches Garmin&apos;s industry-leading dual-frequency tracking step for step. But if you use it for hiking in tree-rich areas, keep an eye out for moments when it might have sudden gaps in coverage.</p><p>For heart rate data, Apple Health&apos;s GPX export doesn&apos;t include heart rate data, so I can only compare generally against other watches.Â </p><p>Across six tracked workouts wearing the Forerunner 965 and Ultra 2, they shared the <strong>exact </strong>same average heart rate. Given how well Garmin&apos;s Elevate v4 sensor has done compared to chest straps in my testing, this reassures me of Apple&apos;s accuracy in general, even if the Apple Fitness HR charts are too vague to dissect properly. I also like that you can customize your heart rate zones.Â </p>
<p>Next, I looked at each watch&apos;s running stats data. In terms of cadence (number of steps per minute), Apple and Garmin were in lockstep, never more than one SPM apart. The same goes for stride length â typically about 1m on both watches.Â </p><p>For more nitpicky stats like vertical oscillation and average ground contact time, Apple slightly underreported my numbers compared to Garmin, but at a consistent gap. I don&apos;t know which is more accurate, but you can count on using either as a benchmark to judge your progress.</p><p>The only <em>noticeable</em> difference is that Apple consistently reports my running power as about 100W lower than Garmin does, despite sharing the same running form, heart rate, and distance stats. After checking other post-run summaries from COROS and Polar, I&apos;m certain Apple&apos;s power calculation is off compared to other brands.Â </p>

<p>Once you pay for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Apple Watch Ultra 2, you&apos;re looking at close to $2,000. It sort of evens out when you put it against a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and Watch 5 Pro because Samsung&apos;s flagship phone is so expensive. Either way, it&apos;s a lot of money to spend on a smartwatch. You can make the case that the Ultra 2 has the longevity to justify it, but you can just as easily argue that no smartwatch should cost so much.Â </p><p>I wasn&apos;t certain if you&apos;d be <em>allowed</em> to spend $799 on the Ultra 2, given Apple&apos;s months-long legal woes with Masimo over its alleged blood oxygen patent infringement. As is, it&apos;s missing a pretty crucial feature for sleep tracking, one that most fitness watches (or regular smartwatches) have. If that&apos;s an issue for you, we have a guide on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-can-measure-blood-oxygen-saturation-levels">best watches for SpO2 tracking</a>.</p>

<p>As for the watch itself, you&apos;ll have to accept how heavy it is. To be clear, anyone who wears a premium Garmin Fenix or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-announced-with-46-day-battery">COROS VERTIX</a> might find the Ultra 2 on the light and thin side, especially with the nylon band. I&apos;ve gotten used to its weight over time, and it sits flatly on my wrist without too much discomfort when I bend it. That said, almost any other watch will feel less noticeable on your wrist.</p><p>Plus, of course, Apple&apos;s Ultra 2 battery life is only long in the context of everyday smartwatches; its 12 hours of dual-band GPS is solid, and it quickly recharges, but it&apos;s far more likely to idle down to a questionable percentage the night before a race if you&apos;re not careful. Compared to the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro&apos;s 80-hour average, 36 hours is more pedestrian.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Causqo8myepw9HByrtUkfe" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-stand-reminder.jpeg" alt="Changing the number of stand alerts on the Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Causqo8myepw9HByrtUkfe.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My bigger issue with the Ultra 2 is what it&apos;s missing compared to other fitness brands. Because I&apos;m not much of an indoor workout person, Apple Fitness Plus doesn&apos;t appeal to me. Apple automatically tracks certain outdoor activities, and watchOS 9 and 10 have prioritized running, hiking, and cycling, but it hasn&apos;t fully caught up to dedicated fitness brands.</p><p>Apple has yet to announce an equivalent to a daily readiness score based on your sleep and activity data or a daily recommended run based on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> and recent workouts. It doesn&apos;t track the training load or effect of a workout, nor does it tell you how long to wait until your next run. It just expects you to close your rings every day.</p><p>And on that note, the Ultra 2&apos;s activity rings aren&apos;t always accurate when it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move reminders</a>, telling me I&apos;ve stood up or burned calories during hours at my desk, presumably due to my nervous fidgeting. That being said, I still love Apple&apos;s ring-closing concept enough that I don&apos;t mind the occasional glitch. It&apos;s still motivational, and that matters to me more than perfect accuracy.</p><p>I hope that watchOS prioritizes post-workout data while adding new watch face complications to show this data on the massive Ultra 2 display. Heck, I&apos;d even take something as simple as showing your step count on the watch display without having to look in the Activity app.</p>

<p>If we&apos;re strictly looking at smartwatches with long battery life and app support, the 80-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> would be my first recommendation. It also uses a titanium, military-grade design with similar sapphire glass but without the diving capabilities. It consistently lasts much longer, though the 1.4-inch display isn&apos;t as spacious or bright. Plus, of course, it doesn&apos;t work for iOS users.Â </p><p>The Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2), with its titanium frame, bright AMOLED display, and fitness focus, is another alternative with one major downside: the lack of apps and phone-watch synchronicity. If you can accept that, you&apos;ll get the same dual-frequency GPS, robust mapping tools, and similar health data as the Ultra 2. It arguably wins for fitness with suggested workouts, calculated hill and endurance scores, and a built-in LED flashlight. It lasts significantly longer at 31 days or 38 dual-band GPS hours. It&apos;s quite expensive, so you may want to look at other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> options.Â </p><p>Lastly, of course, you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, which has the same watchOS software without the doubled battery life, rugged design, and larger, brighter display. Despite this, you can still use the Series 9 for basic fitness activities; you&apos;ll just need to charge it afterward.Â </p>
<p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> has the upside of its Fitbit Premium recs and reliable heart rate data for a much lower price, but that tiny display takes getting used to after becoming accustomed to the Ultra 2.Â </p><p>As for Samsung, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-fitness-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 6 fitness test</a> underwhelmed me with its wonky GPS results and lack of proper workout guidance. I&apos;m still holding out hope that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7 Pro</a> will provide a more Ultra 2-like experience with a bigger fitness focus, along with better sleep data via the Galaxy Ring.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an Apple smartwatch that you don't have to charge every day.</li><li>You want a baseline of fitness accuracy for workouts in a traditional smartwatch.</li><li>You prefer having a variety of third-party workout app options.Â </li><li>You want a standalone watch that'll keep working if your phone dies.Â </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't want to spend a huge amount of money.Â </li><li>You want training load or workout recs baked into the watch's main software.</li><li>You don't want to be locked into the Apple ecosystem.Â </li></ul>
<p>As my first Apple Watch experience, the Ultra 2 made a strong impression. I haven&apos;t spent years getting used to (or sick of) the software, so it feels like a strong, polished experience straight away.Â </p><p>I didn&apos;t have space to discuss every feature I liked, such as the Smart Stack widgets and hiking waypoints, but rest assured that you can spend months using this watch and still learn new features or discover new apps.Â </p><p>I spent many days wearing my Apple and Garmin watches simultaneously, and not just because of the running tests. I like Apple&apos;s polish and responsive notifications, but I don&apos;t want to give up Garmin because its fitness algorithm has truly helped me get more fit, even if its smarts aren&apos;t up to par. If Apple can advance any further in its fitness journey, the Ultra 2 will become even more compelling.Â </p><p>As I said above, that puts pressure on the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro â or the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> â to be more than a battery powerhouse. It needs to be a fitness powerhouse, too. The Watch 5 Pro <em>started </em>this with offline GPX mapping, but it needs to go much further this summer.Â </p><p>Your move, Samsung! Don&apos;t let Apple own this category.</p>

<p>I can only hope that Samsung or Google start selling Ultra-style (or squircle) smartwatches of their own, because right now, Apple has the market cornered on long-lasting smartwatches with massive displays that don't feel like a compromise to use. It has fast performance, reliable workout results, and a surprisingly comfortable fit for its size.Â </p></p>

This is being framed as the best thing that could happen or yet another blunder by the current administration, depending on which talking head you&apos;re listening to and what organization they represent. But what does it all really mean for regular folks like us?</p>

<p>To figure it all out, you need to know what net neutrality is, it&apos;s history, and how the U.S. compares with the rest of the world when it comes to internet access and usage.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-net-neutrality-2">What is net neutrality?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="f8rAyBQLh8Fq4mTB2pGVoC" name="fcc-net-neutrality-keep-net-free-poster.jpg" alt="Protect Net Neutrality rally, San Francisco" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f8rAyBQLh8Fq4mTB2pGVoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Credo Action)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a nutshell, net neutrality means that internet traffic is all treated the same. It doesn&apos;t matter where the data comes from or who it&apos;s going to; it flows across the internet with no interference or restriction. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf">government of New York</a> lays it out nicely:</p><p><em>Net neutrality refers to the principle that the companies that deliver internet service to your home, business, and mobile phone, such as AT&T, Comcast, and Charter (often referred to as internet service providers, ISPs, or broadband providers), should not discriminate among content on the internet. According to this principle, broadband providers cannot block, slow down, or charge to prioritize certain content; rather, they must treat all content equally. This prevents your broadband provider from acting as a gatekeeper and blocking internet content or applications offered by their competitors or from playing favorites among competing services vying for your attention.</em></p>
<p>A more nuanced take is looking back a few years when service providers were fighting with Netflix.</p><p>Back in 2013, Comcast demanded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix">Netflix</a> pay them extra because so many subscribers were using the service. Netflix refused, so Comcast artificially throttled all Netflix streams that used its network, making them unbearably slow.</p><p>As a consumer, the only thing you would have noticed is that Netflix was terrible while other streaming platforms â like the ones offered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/peacock-streaming-service-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it">NBC</a> (Comcast&apos;s parent company) â were great. So, rather than take the hit to its reputation, Netflix paid them off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fij2KqPftDDHWCFBjTGrVQ" name="Netflix-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Netflix app logo on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fij2KqPftDDHWCFBjTGrVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When this happened, customers almost immediately noticed a vast improvement in quality when it came to Netflix streaming. Comcast added no infrastructure to make this happen; it just <em>allowed</em> Netflix data to be treated the same as any other data.</p><p>Net neutrality makes it illegal for Comcast to use these tactics against Netflix or for companies like Time Warner to use them against NBC because consumers are negatively affected when they do. Data is data, and service providers should only be a pipeline to deliver it.</p>
<p>This isn&apos;t automatically a bad thing. Comcast <em>should</em> negotiate for more money from Netflix if it&apos;s causing adverse network conditions. The issue is with Comcast&apos;s tactics because they made consumers suffer.</p><p>Net neutrality opponents say unbiased traffic laws are unnecessary and that more transparency from service providers would allow customers to choose which provider worked best for them.Â </p><p>That may be the case for some people, but not everyone has a choice when it comes to broadband providers. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing">many rural areas</a>, the only choice is to pay the lone provider that services them or not have internet. And in some cases, there is no choice at all.</p>

<p>It&apos;s easy to frame this as an Obama v. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/net-neutrality">Trump</a> v. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/net-neutrality-fcc-joe-biden">Biden</a> fight, but it&apos;s really all at the feet of the FCC.</p><p>The FCC&apos;s attempt to guide service providers and use a light touch when it comes to regulation over the years was a sound choice on paper. In reality, it failed.</p><p>In 2005, the FCC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cybertelecom.org/ci/computerv.htm">classified service providers as information services</a> and not common carriers like telephone service providers. Fast-forward to 2010, when net neutrality was first introduced as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-open-internet-order">Open Internet Order</a>, and the ruling was immediately challenged by broadband providers.</p><p><strong>The broadband providers won</strong>. Most famously, the case of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/%24file/11-1355-1474943.pdf">Verizon v. FCC</a> saw the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacate the portions of the Open Internet Order that deal with blocking or throttling specific internet services. This is because the FCC only has the power to enforce such measures when they apply to common carriers, not information services.</p><p>When providers were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/net-neutrality">classified as common carriers</a> in 2015, it was settled, and then in 2017, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-unveils-plans-roll-back-net-neutrality-rules">the changes were rolled back</a>. Once again, there were no restrictions placed on data providers.</p>
<p>A common carrier is a company regulated by the government to provide a service with no discrimination based on its content. In exchange, these companies are immune from liability for any of the content it has carried. You can&apos;t sue the phone company because one criminal called another criminal and talked about committing crimes against you, for example.Â </p><p>Airlines, railroads, and traditional taxi and carriage companies are common carriers. Some telecommunications services are classified as such, but data providers like broadband ISPs were not.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pkrBtkvQY5nKkBm3RkgXmC" name="hp-chromebook-x360-11-g4-ee-education-7.jpg" alt="HP Chromebook x360 11 G4 EE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkrBtkvQY5nKkBm3RkgXmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HP)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the recent ruling, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">broadband providers</a> are classified as a normal telecommunications service under Title II just like a traditional phone company, and are no longer permitted to discriminate based on content.Â </p><p>This means all data transfer is treated the same, no matter where it originates, and service providers are closer to being a dumb pipe that simply carries the content. The pros of this decision are easy to understand â no company is slowing down your access to information or entertainment as leverage to make money. You paid the same for access when data was purposefully slowed down, so this is a win for consumers.</p>
<p>It&apos;s also a win for education, medical treatment for veterans, first responder&apos;s ability to operate, and families who live across the country or abroad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402091A1.pdf">according to FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez</a>.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5329px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bVdHLDfgSftchP5YQsW5P" name="Commissioners-x5_Dec132024-3.jpg" alt="FCC Commissioners group photo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVdHLDfgSftchP5YQsW5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5329" height="2998" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: FCC)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Opponents, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402089A1.pdf">Commissioner Brendan Carr</a>, do make a valid point. Don&apos;t get sidetracked by the theater of blaming President Obama and comparing the restoration of Title II classification to student loan debt relief. That&apos;s become the norm, and it&apos;s included to satisfy a small portion of the electorate. Read the dissent, and you&apos;ll see that Carr says this will mean higher costs for consumers.Â </p><p><strong>He&apos;s right</strong>. The Comcasts and Verizons of the world will charge us more because they aren&apos;t able to extort money from Netflix or Amazon. The FCC is charged to look out for U.S. consumers, and an act that will raise prices seems to go against that.</p>
<p>It could also be said that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-raises-prices-basic-premium-plans">year over year rate increases</a> we pay for internet services and entertainment was because companies like Netflix and Amazon had to pay more in order to be treated equally, so it all evens out. All the companies involved will pass costs along to consumers whenever they can.</p>
<hr>
<p>We each have to form our own opinion about net neutrality. Every person who writes about it or does a newscast on the subject has his or her own opinion, and their content will reflect that.Â </p><p>This article reflects my opinion that treating broadband data providers as a common carrier is a necessity because of my own circumstances. I rarely think the best first course of action to solve a problem is government oversight. Slow-moving decisions mired in red tape can make things worse and often do. In this case, I think it&apos;s worth the risk.</p><p>You have your own set of circumstances and will form your own opinion.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A loophole in Android TV could allow unauthorized access to Gmail and other linked services if someone gains physical access to the device.</li><li>Through an Android TV box, individuals can potentially hack into the Google account of the last user, compromising Gmail and Google Drive.</li><li>Initially, Google implied the behavior was expected, but later acknowledged the security flaw and claimed to have fixed it on newer Google TV devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A security loophole in Android TV could allow anyone to snoop on your Gmail and other linked services if they get their hands on your device, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/android-tvs-can-expose-user-email-inboxes/" target="_blank">404 Media</a>.</p><p>As per a video posted on YouTube by Cameron Gray earlier this year, if someone gets their hands on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv">Android TV</a> box, they can pretty much hack into the Google account of whoever last logged in, including their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gmail-android-how-to">Gmail</a> and Google Drive (via Mishaal Rahman).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: Do not sign into your personal Google Account on any Android TV device you don't own! https://t.co/l0FScUVT4M<a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1783552498218758184">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>If <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> spots a Google account on the device it&apos;s installed on, it automatically signs you in to any Google services you visit. Now, since Android TV is basically Android in essence, it treats the owner&apos;s Google account sign-in like it&apos;s permanent, so they automatically get logged in to approved apps from the Play Store.</p><p>Even though Google doesn&apos;t officially let you install Chrome on Android TV, you can still sideload it to sneak it on there. And once it&apos;s on, you&apos;ve got access to Gmail, Drive, and all the other services, as demonstrated by the video.</p><p>In the video, Gray installs a third-party web browser called "TV Bro" that you can grab from the Play Store for Android TV. He uses it to dig up an APK for Chrome from some online archive and installs it without any trouble. But the app doesn&apos;t play nice with TV remotes, so you will need a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QiyBXXO8QpA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Once Chrome is up and running, it&apos;s as easy as pie to hop over to Gmail&apos;s website and you&apos;re inâno password needed, no PIN, or biometrics required to prove you&apos;re the TV&apos;s owner.</p><p>Based on what Gray found, Android TV&apos;s weak security makes it a prime target for peeking into signed-in email accounts. If you&apos;re only using Android TV at home, you&apos;re probably in the clear. But if you&apos;re logging into Android TV from some device outside your crib, that&apos;s when you&apos;re asking for trouble.</p><p>Google&apos;s initial stance suggested that&apos;s how this is supposed to work, which technically is true. But it&apos;s still a big security goof. Recently, Google said it fixed the problem on newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-are-all-android-tv-devices-google-tv">Google TV devices</a>.</p><p>The search giant told 404 Media that most of its Google TV devices with the latest software updates no longer allow this shady behavior to happen anymore. But for the rest of the devices, Google is working on pushing out a fix soon.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for clarification on how exactly it plans to resolve the issue, and we&apos;ll update this article once we hear back.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update"><span>Update</span></h2>
<p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/26/google-android-tv-account-security-loophole-fix/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the company clarified that from now on, when you sideload Chrome on Google TV and Android TV, it won&apos;t automatically use the login token for your Google account when you&apos;re trying to access Gmail or Google Drive on the device.</p><p>Additionally, the fix is coming through an app update, so even older devices will get the patch.</p>

It&apos;s not that difficult once you know how, but you&apos;ll need a guide to start you off.Â </p><p>Your first step will also vary based on which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> you own, specifically how many buttons your model has. Unlike most smartwatches, you can&apos;t simply hold down on the main watch face to start customizing.Â </p><p>Below, we&apos;ll explain how to change your Garmin watch face, the best data fields we recommend using, and some of our favorite Connect IQ custom watch faces.Â </p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-your-garmin-watch-face-2">How to change your Garmin watch face</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings menu</strong>: On a 5-button watch like a Forerunner or Instinct, hold the middle-left button, aka the <strong>Up/Menu button</strong>.</p><p>1a. On a two or three-button watch like a Venu or VÃ­voactive, hold down the bottom-right button or the <strong>Back/Lap button</strong>.</p><p>1b. On a <strong>single-button model</strong> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivosmart-5-review">Vivosmart 5</a>, tap the <strong>main button</strong>, then <strong>tap the clock icon</strong> on the touch display.</p>

<p>2. Your first option in this menu should be <strong>Watch Face</strong>; select it with the top-right <strong>Start</strong> button.Â </p><p>3. Use the <strong>Page Up/Down buttons</strong> or swipe on your touchscreen to choose one of the pre-installed watch faces. Hit <strong>Start</strong>.</p>

<p>4. You should see three options: Apply, Customize, and Delete. Choose <strong>Apply</strong> to use the watch face as is, or <strong>Customize</strong> to change the layout and types of <strong>data fields</strong>, as well as the <strong>Accent Color</strong>.Â </p><p>5. Once you&apos;re finished, select <strong>Done</strong> to apply these changes.Â </p>

<p>As you can see, changing your Garmin watch face only requires a few button presses or taps once you know where to start. But <em>customizing</em> a watch face is a bit more complicated because Garmin assumes you know what its data fields â and their vague, unlabeled icons â mean.</p><p>In lieu of a drawn-out list, we&apos;ll link to this Garmin Support page showing key examples for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=agZJiZRjhX2adgWkBVOHI9&identifier=886725&tab=topics" target="_blank"><strong>Garmin Forerunner 965 icons</strong></a>, covering most of the main options available.Â </p><p>A full-sized Garmin watch face can fit about six data fields, plus the main clock field. It&apos;s subjective which data fields pertain to your training or preferences, but we&apos;ll point you to our personal favorites:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Steps (footsteps icon): </strong>An obvious choice for anyone trying to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a>.</li><li><strong>Acute Load (target icon with a triangle) or Earned Intensity Minutes (zooming stopwatch):</strong> For active athletes, it's a great way to confirm quickly how much activity you've completed this week, and if you're on track. You could also do <strong>calories burned (fire icon)</strong> if you prefer a daily number.Â </li><li><strong>Remaining recovery time: (+ sign surrounded by circular arrow): </strong>Quickly check pre-workout whether Garmin's algorithm thinks you're ready (or how long to wait).</li><li><strong>Heart rate (heart icon) </strong>or <strong>Stress (Bolt in figure's head):</strong> If you want a real-time look at your health metrics, elevated data can help you catch moments to do breathing exercises.</li><li><strong>Body Battery (Blue person next to circle with bolt): </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> is one of Garmin's most popular features for measuring your energy level for the day, making it clear how your sleep or activities are affecting you.Â </li><li>You can also choose <strong>Battery level</strong>, but that data is the first thing you see if you scroll down towards the widgets. I prefer seeing the <strong>weather</strong> (<strong>clouds icon</strong>) or the <strong>sunrise/sunset times</strong> (<strong>an arrow pointing at sun</strong>).</li></ul>

<p>Besides the pre-installed watch faces and default data fields, the Garmin Connect IQ app gives you access to community-made watch faces, new data fields, and an option to use personal photos as your watch face.Â </p><p>1. <strong>Install the Connect IQ app</strong> from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garmin.connectiq&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Play Store</a> (Android) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/connect-iq-store/id1317652970" target="_blank">App Store</a> (iOS).</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Search</strong>, then <strong>Watch Faces</strong> to see all the most popular options.</p><p>3. Choose your favorites, then tap <strong>Install > Allow permissions</strong>. You can check the download progress and remaining watch face space available in the <strong>My Device</strong> tab.</p>
<p>4. Next, if you want, tap the<strong> Face It tab</strong> to create a custom watch face using a personal photo.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>+ button</strong>, then <strong>Photos </strong>or <strong>Camera</strong>. Choose <strong>Limit Access</strong> and select the individual photo or photos you&apos;d like to see on your watch.Â </p><p>6. Choose a <strong>Layout</strong>, then tap <strong>+Add </strong>under Complications to add specific data fields besides the default options. You can then <strong>drag</strong> these data fields anywhere on the watch face.Â </p><p>7. Hit <strong>Save</strong>, name the watch face if you want, then hit <strong>Install</strong>.Â </p>

<p>While this article is about Garmin watch faces, take some time in the Connect IQ app to look at any custom, community-made apps or data fields that you may want on your watch. You&apos;ll find them in the <strong>Search </strong>tab as well.Â </p><p>For example, when we tested this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">CORE temperature sensor</a> for thermal training, you could install an "official" Connect IQ data field to show your body temp on the watch during a workout.Â </p><p>Once you&apos;re done, look back at your Garmin watch. You&apos;ll find your newly installed watch faces at the bottom when scrolling past the pre-installed options. As for new data fields, you can add them by going back to the <strong>Settings menu</strong>, then scrolling to <strong>Activities & Apps > Sport > Sport settings > Data screens</strong>, then finding it under <strong>Connect IQ fields</strong> when adding a new screen.Â </p>

<p>Now that you know how to change your Garmin watch face, you can see how Garmin makes a bunch of data available for you to see at a glance. We do wish you could tap the data fields on your watch face to pull up a more detailed widget, as you can with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, though.Â </p><p>Newer watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> introduced a slightly revamped Garmin UI, and we can hope that more traditional smartwatch features will make their way to newer models over time now that more and more are adding AMOLED touch displays.Â </p>

<ul><li>After shutting down Google Podcasts for good, Google shared an interview with YouTube's chief product officer to discuss the future of podcasts on YouTube Music.</li><li>YouTube Music wants to become the "ultimate destination" for podcasts, both for creators and listeners.Â </li><li>Unfortunately, the interview did not include much to address concerns podcast users have with YouTube Music, such as the absence of core features like new episode notifications.Â </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Whether we like it or not, YouTube Music is the future of podcast hosting at Google. With the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shuts-down">shutting down Google Podcasts</a> once and for all earlier this month, YouTube Music is Google&apos;s focus moving forward. In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/shaping-the-future-of-podcasts/" target="_blank">interview</a> published by YouTube, the platform&apos;s Chief Product Officer Johanna Voolich explained the plan "to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> the ultimate destination for podcasters and fans alike."</p><p>Despite podcasts being an audio-first medium, YouTube wants to lean into what it does best: video. YouTube says it has made changes to the YouTube Music app to better support audio-centric content, but it adds that video can provide extra value to a podcast. "The second way we think about podcasts is [as an] eyes-optional experience," Voolich said. "So, stuff that&apos;s great to hear and listen to, but also can be great to watch as well."</p><p>Voolich emphasized the possibility for users to start listening to a podcast and finish it by watching the video version or vice versa.</p><p>Again, leaning into its strengths, YouTube thinks the platform&apos;s experience in building algorithms will come in handy when serving suggested podcasts to users. "YouTube&apos;s secret sauce is our recommendations," said YouTube Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/shaping-the-future-of-podcasts/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "They help people discover something new or go deeper on what they love, while helping podcasters reach new audiences only found on YouTube."</p><p>Aside from the typical features offered by YouTube, Voolich emphasized the changes that have been made to YouTube Music specifically for the benefit of podcasters and listeners. "We&apos;ve rolled out several new features including support for third-party RSS podcasts, updates to the Android Auto experience for easy in-car listening, enhanced download options, and customizable playlist sorting," the blog post added.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idkTKYAdeV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>However, the interview didn&apos;t address some of the major concerns that YouTube Music users have had with enjoying podcasts on the platform. There were few clear mentions of the platform&apos;s future plans, with the only notable one being that YouTube Music is not planning to support RSS out feeds anytime soon.</p><p>"Over the past year, we&apos;ve been working to build in all of the traditional podcasting features to YouTube Music," Voolich said. "The first thing we did was actually just pull in podcast content, but then also traditional things like being able to play in a series, continue watching, [and] have a shelf for discovery."</p><p>There appears to still be a long way to go for YouTube Music. The platform still lacks essential podcast features, such as new episode notifications and mark-as-played indicators. Presumably, those features are coming, but this interview doesn&apos;t give us much in terms of a concrete roadmap as to when we can expect them.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Nothing rolls out Nothing OS 2.5.5 and OS 2.5.5.a to Phone 1 and Phone 2a, respectively.</li><li>Both bring ChatGPT integration to the devices, which require Ear and Ear a products to use new gestures.</li><li>The integration also brings new ChatGPT widgets for the home screen.</li><li>Several new features, improvements, and bug fixes come with these new firmware releases.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing rolled out a new update to the Phone 2 last week, bringing ChatGPT integration to the device. This week, the company&apos;s other two phones received the same update with Nothing OS 2.5.5.</p><p>The integration on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> is similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-chatgpt-integration-camera-update">we have seen</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>. Users still have to install ChatGPT from the Google Play Store, after which Phone 1 and 2a users would then head to the Nothing X app to find the new gesture option to start a voice conversation with ChatGPT. The feature currently works with the Nothing Ear and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review">Ear (a)</a> that were recently launched.Â </p><p>In the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/9447-nothing-os-255-rolling-out-for-phone-1">community post</a>, Nothing indicates that previous audio products from the company would also incorporate the functionality soon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ykJkoWbJqk4wvouwFsrDJR" name="Nothing-phone-1-display-01.jpg" alt="The front of the Nothing phone (1)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykJkoWbJqk4wvouwFsrDJR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moreover, new ChatGPT widgets can be added to the home screen for easier access to the AI assistant. Nothing is further adding a new button on the screenshot and clipboard pop-up that allows users to paste content to start a conversation in the ChatGPT directly.</p><p>Aside from the ChatGPT integration, the <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5</strong> update for the Phone 1 is significant as it brings several new features, improvements, and general fixes. The features comprise a new option to apply the Nothing Icon pack only to the Home Screen "to improve accessibility in the App Drawer."Â </p><p>Further, users can hold app icons while scrolling through pages on the Home Screen if they choose to reorganize icons. Phone 1 users also choose to allow Quick Settings to show up on the Lock Screen. Additionally, they can customize icons on the status bar through Display settings.</p><p>The company is also adding a RAM booster feature, although our Jerry Hildenbrand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">doesn&apos;t recommend using these</a>.</p>
<p>The other improvements with the <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5</strong> update on the Phone 1 include the integration of an AI-powered algorithm for auto brightness. Quick Settings tiles have also been reordered as part of accessibility improvements, and the Bluetooth and volume settings experience have also been optimized for a smoother experience.</p><p>The other general fixes, per the changelog on the Phone 1 include:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where Wi-Fi would automatically disconnect.</li><li>Resolved a problem causing earbud volume to not sync with the phone's volume.</li><li>Resolved an issue where audio would not switch to a connected watch during calls when also connected to an earbud.</li><li>Fixed an issue where screenshots did not display the frame or allow entry into the editor.</li><li>Resolved a rare problem causing a lack of vibration feedback when swiping sideways to go back on the screen.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BtTNm49uwYhiYGgSDi63ZU" name="nothing-phone-2a-18.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BtTNm49uwYhiYGgSDi63ZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 2a, on the other hand, receives an incremental <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.5.a</strong> build, which follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-receives-april-2024-security-patch">OS 2.5.5 update</a> that was rolled out last week.Â </p><p>Next to the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, the latest update brings improvements to the camera, including color consistency for the primary wide-angle camera and portrait brightness in HDR scenes that are based on user skin tones.Â </p><p>An abnormal noise issue in portrait mode has been fixed, and the camera app&apos;s starting performance also sees improvements, as Nothing says it had adjusted CPU scheduling strategies.</p>
<p>The other notable changes with the update to Phone 2a comprise optimizations to the visual display of battery levels in the Battery widget for the home screen. There is an enhanced power-saving mode that will keep vibrations for calls and notifications active. The AI-powered algorithm for auto-brightness is also seen on the Phone 2a.</p><p>You can read the full details about the Nothing Phone 2a update on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/9497-nothing-os-255a-rolling-out-for-phone-2a">Nothing&apos;s community forum</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Ayaneo has finally shared more details regarding its next Android gaming handheld.Â </li><li>The Pocket S is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, featuring up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.Â </li><li>There are two versions available, with the Pocket S 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition.</li><li>Ayaneo's Indiegogo campaign is underway, with "Early Bird" prices starting at either $399 or $439.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Before the calendar flipped into 2024, Qualcomm and Ayaneo surprised us all with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-reveal-teaser">Pocket S</a>. After a few teasers here and there, but nothing substantial being shared, that&apos;s all changed. Ayaneo has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/828">officially shared</a> the full spec sheet, along with pricing.</p><p>Nothing has changed in that the Pocket S will still be powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. However, it turns out that there Ayaneo is planning to launch two versions, the 1080P Edition and 1440P Advance Edition. The only difference between the two will be the screen resolution, but everything else remains the same.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-breakdown.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S highlighted specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khd8uAnLAYQKaxjAr8smTh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you might suspect, the 1080P Edition features a 6-inch "Borderless" IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. The Advance Edition includes the same screen size but with an increased resolution of 2560 x 1440 for a higher pixel density and clearer picture. Surprisingly, there was no mention made of whether either model will offer refresh rates above 60Hz.Â </p>

<p>Paired with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, Ayaneo is offering either 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of expandable storage. If you opt for the 512GB or 1TB model, the Pocket S utilizes UFS 4.0, while the 128GB version relies on the older UFS 3.1 standard.Â </p>

<p>What all this means in terms of performance is kind of subjective. According to Ayaneo, the G3x Gen 2 offers 30% more CPU performance, while "GPU performance is doubled" compared to the G3x Gen 1. Ayaneo also claims that this chip will allow the Pocket S to "achieve a maximum continuous performance output of 15W."</p><p>Moving onto the design, it&apos;s about what you might expect, basically offering an Android-powered Nintendo Switch without removable controllers. The Pocket S has a few extra features that might surprise you, as it includes Hall Sensing Joysticks and Linear Hall Triggers. These are preferred amongst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> owners, as they are magnetic and reduce the likelihood of dealing with stick drift.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-white-product-render.jpeg" alt="Ayaneo Pocket S product lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLYBgxvcTJzSgqWFncizni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ayaneo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s pretty obvious that Ayaneo is going for elegance with the Pocket S, a far cry from the "retro" theme that was offered with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocked-air-android-handheld-gaming">Pocket AIR</a>. Instead of relying on a plastic shell on the front and back, the Pocket S is made from a "CNC aluminum alloy mid-frame" along with 2.5D glass on the front panel. Â </p><p>Ergonomics might be a concern for some, and Ayaneo has also thought of that. The company includes a "protective shell ... incorporating ergonomic grips." And when your gaming session is done, there&apos;s a Magnetic Detachable Flip Cover that keeps the screen looking nice.Â </p>

<p>Now for the big question â price. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-s-snapdragon-g3x-gen2-new-android-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a> is already underway, with IGG Early Bird pricing starting at either $399 for the 1080P Edition or $439 for the 1440P Advance Edition. This is for the base configuration, which includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. And if you want the "best of the best," you&apos;re looking at either $559 or $589, respectively.</p><p>Once the Indiegogo campaign comes to a conclusion, the retail price jumps up quite a bit for both models. With the same base configuration, the Pocket S 1080P Edition will set you back $559, while the 1440P Advance Edition comes in at $589. At the time of this writing, Ayaneo has already blown past its Indiegogo goal, and you can still get your hands on those Early Bird models.Â </p>

<p>Lastly, we will have to wait just a little bit longer before the Pocket S makes its way to the masses. According to Ayaneo, the 1440P Advance Edition will begin shipping sometime in the "middle of May." Meanwhile, the 1080P Edition arrives at the "end of June."Â </p>

<ul><li>Google's upcoming "Cubes" feature was spotted early on the Play Store and its highlight card spills what users can expect on its full arrival.</li><li>The card suggests Cubes will be the "one place" for users to interact with shows, shopping apps, food, music, and more.</li><li>The background of the card showcases its potential UI alongside "continue watching" and "continue playing" so users can get back into their activities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seemed to accidentally show off its upcoming "Cubes" feature on the Play Store, giving us a good idea of what to expect.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/25/google-play-store-cubes/">9to5Google</a>, heading into the Apps tab of the Play Store held an interesting animated card with a "continue watching" banner. Its early appearance is furthered by a paw icon, which Google typically uses to represent features in testing, and it has shown up on at least one of our devices.</p><p>The card is described as "a shortcut to what matters," alluding to a place users could enter to "watch, shop, and more in one place."</p><p>Curiously, tapping the card sends users to a page dedicated to the coming Cubes feature. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial?id=mc_apps_cube_launch_fcp_updated">it&apos;s completely blank</a>. It&apos;s speculated that the page could hold Google&apos;s official reveal and details about Cubes whenever the feature rolls out.</p><p>The card cycled through examples of where users could "watch" and "shop" in Cubes. The former highlighted streaming services like Hulu, Max, and Amazon Prime, while the latter showcased shopping sites and restaurants like McDonald&apos;s.</p><p>You can see the card at the top of the screenshots below:</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance.jpg" alt="A snapshot of Google's "Cubes" card making an early appearance on the Play Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88jYxyMAn82NvkNeTz7aij.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:259px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:231.66%;"><img id="VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3" name="google-play-store-cubes-early-appearance-shoppinng-teaser.jpg" alt="The "Cubes" card on the Play Store showing food and shopping examples." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VD4sJNotUMo8mrjqg4LFB3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="259" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Further examination of the card&apos;s background revealed what the Cubes UI will likely look like upon launch. Users may find a row of options along the top, such as "Watch, Listen, Read, Games, and Shop." Imaging suggests "Listen" will throw users into podcast recommendations and even some info pulled from Spotify&apos;s "New Music Friday."</p><p>"Continue watching" and "continue playing" sections were spotted in their respective tabs, which should help users get back into what they were doing previously.</p><p>Aside from the slip-up, it&apos;s unclear when Google plans to debut Cubes officially on the Play Store.</p><p>One thing this early preview of Cubes seems to suggest is that it may not remove users from the Play Store as originally theorized. Cubes was first spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-cubes-app-play-store-code">last November</a>, and it seemed like a new app provided by the Play Store rather than an experience within the app store. While it looks like users may be able to decide which apps cooperate with Cubes for content recommendations, Google might also include a selection of "pre-selected" ones just as an introduction.</p><p>That early preview also seemingly teased the possibility of a "Social" and a more specific "Food" tab. For now, it&apos;s not clear when Cubes will officially launch, but its appearance suggests it may not be long.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube TV is offering a new deal for new users who bundle it with the NFL Sunday Ticker.</li><li>Users can save $170 on the Sunday Ticket and see their monthly bill drop by $15 for the first three months.</li><li>The NFL Sunday Ticket rewarded subscribers with unlimited simultaneous streams while at home in 2023 and introduced a monthly payment option for "most states."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV is kickstarting a new deal (until May 16) for those interested in grabbing an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription before the 2024 season begins.</p><p>The streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">announced</a> its "lowest price of the year" via the YouTube TV account on X. In celebration of the NFL Draft, the company states new users can bundle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/?utm_campaign=ytnflst_social_nflst_amplification_q1_2024&utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_content=cta">NFL Sunday Ticket</a> <em>with </em>YouTube TV to save up to $215 until May 16.</p><p>Bundling the NFL Sunday Ticket will save new users $170. After purchasing, YouTube states users&apos; monthly payments will be reduced by $15. The monthly reduction will last for the first three months.</p><p>This means users will pay around $57 for three months before YouTube TV kicks it back up to its standard $72 per month.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our best offer of the year! Save $215 when you bundle @NFL Sunday Ticket and @YouTubeTV https://t.co/Aan8KBV5XX<a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1783556636671414605">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The YouTube team took to X to answer some user questions regarding how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1783581748841808344">last year&apos;s subscribers could get in</a> on the deal. The post states NFL Sunday Ticket holders from 2023, who also enabled auto-renew, must cancel the auto-renewed purchase. After, users must re-purchase the subscription to take part in the deal before the May 16 cut-off.</p><p>YouTube&apos;s deal card reiterates that the Sunday Ticket is what gives users access to over 160 out-of-market games "per season." The YouTube TV side is how football lovers can get locally televised games every Sunday. Moreover, viewers can watch every Sunday and Monday night game, the 2024 preseason, playoffs, and Super Bowl.</p><p>Before 2023&apos;s kickoff, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-unlimited-nfl-streaming">YouTube highlighted</a> the addition of unlimited simultaneous streams for NFL Sunday Ticket holders. The ability to do so pertained to those watching games from home. However, those on the go gained two additional streams to tack onto their Sunday content.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth remembering that, due to user feedback, YouTube TV subscribers can set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-teases-nfl-sunday-ticket-features">monthly payment plan</a> for the NFL subscription. This allows folks to pay at their own cadence and hop out if the price becomes overbearing. Unfortunately, the company rolled out support for monthly payments in "most states," which left a few others out of the useful option.</p>
