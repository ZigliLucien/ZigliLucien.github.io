<p>I didn&apos;t buy much this Prime Day as some of the things I was looking at weren&apos;t on sale. However, we did need a new air fryer, our old one is a bit janky. We opted for this Cosori in white and I&apos;m pretty excited about getting it. Getting an air fryer is actually incredibly great for your kitchen and you can make a lot of great meals. I think it looks especially clean and classy, too.</p><p><strong>* COSORI Pro Gen 2 Air Fryer</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Performance-Functions-Dishwasher-Safe-Detachable/dp/B0BD4BYR11?th=1"><del>$119</del> <strong>$99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The other thing I got wasn&apos;t on sale, unfortunately. I have been wanting one of these SpinWave mops because I&apos;ve heard some really good things. I&apos;ve also heard the cordless version isn&apos;t very good when it comes to battery life so I opted for the corded version even though it&apos;s not on sale. Since Bissell sends a portion of every sale to its pet foundation it&apos;s OK. I&apos;ll support any company that loves dogs as much as I do!</p><p><strong>* Bissell SpinWave PET Hard Floor Spin Mop: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-SpinWave-Hard-Floor-20399/dp/B08HZFVNS7?th=1"><strong>$108 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>I purchased this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/">Audio-Technica Bluetooth Turntable</a> as sort of an impulse buy. Ever since my friend got a turntable a year ago, I&apos;ve been wanting one myself, mostly for the nostalgia of it all. This looked like the best option as it supports Bluetooth 5, Qualcomm AptX, and Hi-Fi audio, meaning I finally have a reason to dust off my Marshall speaker. I don&apos;t own any vinyl records right now, but many of my favorite artists have released their albums on vinyl, and I plan to start a collection.</p><p><strong>* Audio-Technica Fully Automatic Stereo Turntable:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3RFXRL/"><del>$219</del> <strong>$149 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>I didn&apos;t have a PlayStation growing up, so I missed the train on Kojima&apos;s weird game series. I can&apos;t keep up with all the live-service crap and massive AAA open worlds anymore, so I&apos;m excited to dive into games that (from what I hear) have their issues but also have a ton of creativity, heart, and fun ideas.

I’ve had my eye on these smart TVs for a while but wasn’t sure if they were too gimmicky or not. The idea is simple: you take a Samsung smart TV and give it an anti-glare display with a matte finish alongside a super-lightweight construction that sits flat against the wall. Once it’s installed, The Frame TV is supposed to look indistinguishable from a framed painting (when you use Art Mode, of course). I love the idea of not having an ugly TV hanging in my bedroom, and since Amazon is dropping 15% off the 43-inch model, it seemed worth a shot!</p><p><strong>* Samsung 43-Inch The Frame Series Smart TV:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9HY4J9?th=1"><del>$997</del> <strong>$847 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<ul><li>Garmin watch face developers have spotted and leaked official references to new "Garmin fēnix 8 MicroLED" and "tactix 8 — AMOLED" watches.</li><li>A previous leak suggested Garmin was developing the Fenix 8 MicroLED and a new Fenix 8 Pro.</li><li>Garmin only recently launched the base Garmin Fenix 8 on August 27.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Leaks suggest that a surprise Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED edition might arrive relatively soon. We&apos;ve heard rumors for years that most major smartwatch makers want to replace OLED displays with MicroLEDs, so Garmin launching theirs before Apple and Samsung would be a major coup.</p><p>If this leak is accurate, the timing could royally piss off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Garmin Fenix 8</a> buyers. But the evidence suggests Garmin won&apos;t pull off this win so easily.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/10/07/garmin-tactix-8-fenix-8/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> posted a screenshot of a list of "compatible devices" for developers making new Garmin watch faces. The list includes all recent Garmin AMOLED watches, but it has one exception: the "Garmin fēnix 8 MicroLED." It also includes another unannounced watch, the Garmin Tactix 8 AMOLED, which would ship in 47mm and 51mm case sizes.</p><p>Last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2024/09/10/garmin-microled/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> posted another alleged leak, showing the Garmin Connect app page that appears when you add a new device. The list includes the Garmin Fenix 8 MicroLED and the Fenix 8 Pro 47mm / 51mm. Those devices don&apos;t appear in the current app version, but they may have been removed.</p>

<p>MicroLED supplier Vuzix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/2081/garmin-collaborates-with-vuzix-to-develop-next-generation">announced</a> a partnership with Garmin in May 2024 for a "next generation nano-imprinted waveguide-based display system" with MicroLED tech, but waveguide displays are specifically for transparent lenses like the ones in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vuzix.com/products/vuzix-shield-smart-glasses">Vuzix Shield AR glasses</a>. Garmin makes several products for truck drivers, and AR glasses with directional tech would fit that description better.</p><p>It&apos;s possible that Vuzix would pull double duty and make MicroLED display tech for Garmin watches. We simply have no evidence that&apos;s the company&apos;s area of expertise, or that Garmin has <em>another</em> MicroLED partner to use.</p><p>MicroLED display tech is meant to match or beat the visual quality and brightness of an AMOLED display without needing a backlight. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> are beloved for their long battery life, but the company&apos;s pivot from battery-saving MIP to brighter AMOLEDs is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">controversial</a> with long-time users. MicroLED probably wouldn&apos;t come close to MIP for efficiency, but it would bridge the longevity gap.</p>
<h2 id="an-incredible-microled-turnaround-if-true-2">An incredible MicroLED turnaround, if true</h2>
<p>First, the positives: If (and it&apos;s a big if) Garmin is selling a MicroLED watch this year or next, it would be at a pace that will make Apple and Samsung jealous.</p><p>Samsung allegedly "started to commercialize MicroLED technology for smartwatches" in 2023 according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-making-microled-displays-for-smartwatches/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, with "hopes to complete the development within this year." Then another report suggested Samsung wanted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">use a MicroLED display in the Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> in 2024. </p><p>Either the reports were false or Samsung realized it couldn&apos;t affordably insert the tech into its watches yet. It does sell MicroLED TVs...that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is already expensive enough with its current display, and the 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> should stick to AMOLED.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve also heard competing rumors for years about Apple&apos;s MicroLED plans. After analysts claimed it would arrive in 2024 or 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/apple-scraps-plan-to-design-display-for-watch-in-house-cuts-jobs">Bloomberg</a> reported that Apple gave up on its MicroLED plans for the Apple Watch in March 2024. Just this week, however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/10/06/apple-hasnt-abandoned-microled-tech-despite-recent-setbacks">Appleinsider</a> claimed that Apple intends to sell a microLED Ultra watch in 2026. The reports make Apple sound indecisive about the idea.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-reportedly-buying-microled-display-maker-raxium-for-its-ar-push">bought MicroLED supplier Raxium</a> in 2022, with the assumption that it would use the tech for AR glasses — possibly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra AR glasses</a> we saw at Google I/O 2024. But in theory, Google could follow in Samsung&apos;s footsteps and use MicroLED displays in a Pixel Watch.</p><p>The through line here is that big tech brands see MicroLED as the future of smartwatch and AR glasses display tech, but are having trouble implementing it quickly. If Vuzix had product-ready MicroLED tech for Garmin watches less than a year after its announced partnership, that would be unusually fast.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-just-released-the-fenix-8-2">Garmin JUST released the Fenix 8</h2>
<p>Let&apos;s ignore the industry evidence that MicroLED probably isn&apos;t ready for any smartwatch, and that if Garmin were to sell a Fenix 8 MicroLED, it would probably be prohibitively expensive, maybe on par with its luxury MARQ watches that cost $2–3,000.</p><p>Suppose Garmin really did pull off a coup and sells a new Fenix 8 MicroLED soon. The timing would be brutal to everyone who spent anywhere from $999 to $1,199 on a brand-new AMOLED watch, not realizing there&apos;d be an even better option a few months away. (I assume the Fenix 8 MIP Solar buyers won&apos;t mind as much.)</p><p>This would also apply if the leaked Fenix 8 Pro arrives soon, since Garmin usually waits a year between a base Fenix and its mid-cycle refresh. If you&apos;re spending that much on a watch, you want to feel like you have the best possible option with every new software feature for a year or more, not a few months.</p><p>Aside from a few minor launches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-lily-2-active-launch-details">Lily 2 Active</a>, we probably won&apos;t see any more major Garmin launches in 2024. But a spring 2025 launch of any new Garmin Fenix 8 would raise eyebrows and generate FOMO in Garmin&apos;s biggest spenders.</p><p>But I&apos;ll return to my original point: Whether or not Garmin plans to sell a Fenix 8 MicroLED, I&apos;m skeptical it can pull it off quickly. And as a Fenix 8 owner, I&apos;d have some complicated emotions if Garmin bucks expectations.</p>

Despite the convincing evidence, there's reasons to doubt whether Garmin can pull this off, based on Apple and Samsung's struggles with the technology. ]]>

<hr>
<p>Android devices run a specific aesthetic that the software can deploy automatically, but one app never adhered to those rules.</p><p>Google was spotted rolling out an update for the Pixel Buds app that brings a closer pairing between it and Android 13&apos;s (and higher) Material You. Known Android deep diver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1843582603988697190">AssembleDebug</a> posted on X that the app is picking up a themed icon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-buds-app-material-you-dynamically-themed-icon/?taid=670638217aa340000121a69c&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>).</p><p>In version 1.0.680489030, users will notice that, if "themed icons" are enabled, the Pixel Buds app will take on whatever color is selected. The Pixel Buds app is a huge part of its Pixel ecosystem and has only recently fallen in line with Google&apos;s classic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> design language.</p><p>Users can hop into their "personalization" settings on their Android device to enable/disable themed icons. Additionally, users have begun listing the other apps Google has yet to give the same treatment. Play Games, Opinion Rewards, and Google Translate were among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/buttermilkoreo/status/1843623053701333085">those mentioned</a>.</p><p>We have yet to notice the update appear on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a>, so it&apos;s likely still making its rounds to Android devices. Continue to check and update your apps as not every device will see simultaneously.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pixel Buds app finally gets a themed icon ☠️Version • 1.0.680489030 Apkmirror - https://t.co/PSZx1oOzJW pic.twitter.com/PH6pyN9LAg<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1843582603988697190">October 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Despite this minimalistic design update for the Pixel Buds app, Google is seemingly preparing more for earbud enjoyers. A report from September showed that Google is working to bring the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-noise-control-option-audio-mode-return">Noise Control</a>" panel back to Android 15. This redesigned panel would let users swap quickly between ANC (active noise cancelation) and transparency mode on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> or O.G. Buds Pro.</p><p>The panel will merge a convenient floating menu with the Pixel Buds app&apos;s capabilities. The early discovery shows that users will (likely) have to tap the "Spatial Audio" option in the panel, which will bring up a smaller Noise Control panel provided by the Buds app.</p><p>This information was highlighted based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-2-bluetooth-fixes-features-rollout">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2</a>. Google is still working on Android 15; however, rumor has it October is the month we might see it.</p>

<p>Honor and Google teamed up to bring Circle Search to the Magic V3 and Honor 200 series, making searching quicker and easier on these devices.</p><p>Honor calls the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> the world’s thinnest inward-foldable phone, and it made its global debut last month at IFA in Berlin. It first launched in China back in August, where Honor hinted at new AI features like AI Eraser, Face-to-Face Translation, and Notes Live Translation for the foldable.</p><p>Today&apos;s announcement means the Honor Magic V3 is ready to throw down against Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> with the addition of Circle to Search. The AI search feature is also coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200</a> series later this year.</p><p>Honor sees AI as a key part of future living and is committed to its development through continuous research and teamwork in the industry, as per the company&apos;s press release. To help get AI into more hands, the company introduced its Four-layer AI Architecture, which combines on-device AI with cloud capabilities to enhance security through the company&apos;s Personal Cloud Compute.</p><p>Google first rolled out its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January, followed by the Pixel 8 lineup in February. By August, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-affordable-phones-and-tablets-are-picking-up-circle-to-search">expanded to mid-range Samsung devices too</a>.</p><p>Circle to Search makes finding info on your device super easy. Just draw a circle around an object in a photo or a word in text with your finger, and it instantly identifies it, bringing up relevant search results.</p><p>Our own Nicholas Sutrich recently revealed that Circle to Search is also heading to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">Tecno Phantom V Fold 2</a>, which might mean other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> from more OEMs could get in on this awesome search tool soon too.</p><p>Adding Circle to Search definitely boosts the appeal of the new Honor device. But we&apos;ll have to wait and see if it can live up to all the hype it’s been getting.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Parallels for ChromeOS, which lets Chromebooks run Windows apps, might soon be shutting down.</li><li>A new report highlights that there haven't been major updates for about 18 months, hinting at dwindling interest from Google.</li><li>After a promising start, the project has been stagnant, with the last significant update in mid-2022 for lower-end Intel and AMD chipsets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Parallels for ChromeOS, the service that enables Chromebooks to run Windows apps, is on the verge of closing up shop.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/leaks-confirm-parallels-on-chromebooks-is-dead-in-the-water/" target="_blank">Chrome Unboxed</a>, there haven&apos;t been any major updates to Parallels on Chromebooks for about eighteen months. This points to a possible decrease in the company&apos;s interest in the project.</p><p>Once just a pipe dream, running Windows on a Chromebook became a reality in 2020 when Google teamed up with Parallels to bring both Android and Windows apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Parallels Desktop is a virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer. Mac users often use it to run Windows applications on their Apple devices.</p><p>While the project had a strong start, it’s been stuck in a lull for quite some time. The latest noteworthy update came in mid-2022, when Parallels was improved to work with budget-friendly Intel and AMD chipsets.</p><p>The long stretch without updates, along with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/cameyo-virtual-app-delivery-windows-apps">Google’s recent purchase of Cameyo</a>, which mentioned bringing virtual Windows apps to ChromeOS as a key reason, foreshadowed a potential change in direction for the project.</p><p>With the limited focus and various challenges it&apos;s facing, it’s no shock that Parallels Desktop could be heading for the chopping block soon.</p><p>While Parallels-on-Chromebook provides a practical way to run legacy apps on ChromeOS, it comes with some ironic challenges. One major issue is that you need a high-performance Chromebook to make the virtual desktop work, which kind of goes against the budget-friendly appeal that Chromebooks are known for.</p><p>Rumor has it that Google has decided to shut down the Parallels-on-Chromebook initiative. Users can expect to get official word on this soon, with a formal announcement likely coming before the end of the year.</p><p>Additionally, it seems that Parallels for ChromeOS will also be phased out by year&apos;s end, although a specific date hasn’t been revealed yet.</p>

<p>I&apos;m extremely fortunate in that I&apos;m able to work from home, without needing to traverse through hordes of traffic to an office every day. This also gives me the freedom of being able to work from anywhere, but I don&apos;t always have a laptop or tablet with me. What I do have with me is at least one phone, and with the TouchPad Fusion, I don&apos;t have to worry about packing up my laptop just to head to the store. </p>

<p>As someone who has long been on the lookout for the perfect portable Bluetooth keyboard, the Mokibo Touchpad Fusion checks all of the boxes. Its built-in stand accommodates different types of devices, and the built-in touchpad is simply divine to use. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/MOKIBO-Touchpad-Bluetooth-Keyboard-12-9-inch/dp/B0C5WF5J3Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4e52fd24-58b8-48f6-a939-a132da363d3d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Mokibo Touchpad Fusion: $99" data-dimension48="Mokibo Touchpad Fusion: $99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You want a Bluetooth keyboard that offers a built-in trackpad, along with a way to prop up your phone or tablet from anywhere. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need something that&apos;s a bit more wallet-friendly.  </p>
<p>I&apos;ve adopted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSOpcUkE-is7u7c4AkLgqTw">Mr. Mobile</a> lifestyle, relying on an iPhone for family communications and a foldable phone for practically everything else. However, trying to write longer-form articles isn&apos;t exactly comfortable, even on larger screens like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, I was ecstatic after hearing about the Touchpad Fusion. First, there are two different options available, as you can get one for devices up to either 11-inches or 12.9-inches. There&apos;s no real difference in the keyboard itself, just with the built-in stand that you prop up your device with.</p><p>After getting it paired with your device, the real magic begins. You can just start typing, using it just as you would any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-bluetooth-keyboard-for-android">Bluetooth keyboard</a>. But there&apos;s also an invisible touchpad built into the surface of the Fusion Touchpad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2AwmqRKJbwQjAQ5FNZGeq5" name="mokibo-touchpad-fusion-touchpad-area-graphic.jpg" alt="Touchpad area on the Mokibo Touchpad Fusion" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2AwmqRKJbwQjAQ5FNZGeq5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mokibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It vertically spans from the top of the space bar to the bottom of the function row and horizontally spans from the middle of the Caps Lock key to the middle of the Return key.</p><p>I will admit that there is a bit of a learning curve to using the TouchPad Fusion, but once it clicks, you&apos;ll never want to use anything else. Plus, it can be paired with up to three devices at once and has corresponding OS modes that you can switch between.</p><p>So why did I buy another one? Simply because it&apos;s a great deal, and I want to make sure that I have a backup in case something happens to the first one. If you&apos;re still not convinced, I&apos;ve included a few alternatives below for you to consider. </p>

<p>The ProtoArc XK01 TP offers much of the same versatility as the Fusion Touchpad, with one major difference. There's a more traditional touchpad built in, to the right of the keyboard. This also has the added benefit of being a tri-fold, making it much more portable. </p>

<p>Another option if you prefer a more traditional touchpad is the iClever BK08. Like the ProtoArc, the touchpad is to the right, but it features physical buttons, as opposed to the all-in-one approach of the XK01 TP.  <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-iClever-Pocket-Sized-Tri-Folding-Smartphones/dp/B01MTVC775" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5740b9ca-fa57-4234-90c2-3b4067deebe5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$52.99" data-dimension48="$52.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>This Bluetooth keyboard won't exactly offer a more comfortable typing experience, but it sure is convenient. I already own the Rii K06 Mini, and it's paired to three different streaming devices. This makes it so I can type and control my TV, regardless of where the remote might have ended up. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rii-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Lightweight-Compatible/dp/B0BML42L6X/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ac8d8b89-f1cd-4184-91c3-ef5b4d91e73f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Rii K06 Mini Bluetooth Keyboard: $26.99" data-dimension48="Rii K06 Mini Bluetooth Keyboard: $26.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<hr>
<p>Google could soon face regulatory action as the DOJ considers antitrust measures to rein in the company’s grip on online search, which could involve splitting off Android, Chrome, and related assets.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department has unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle Google’s monopoly as part of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1052.0.pdf" target="_blank">antitrust lawsuit</a> against the company, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/doj-indicates-its-considering-google-breakup-following-monopoly-ruling.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>. This comes on the heels of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">DOJ&apos;s legal victory in August</a> when a U.S. District Court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pulse-google-is-now-a-monopoly-but-nothing-will-really-change">labeled Google a “monopolist” for breaking antitrust laws</a> in its efforts to stay the default search engine on devices and browsers.</p><p>The U.S. government has spotted a potential anticompetitive network connecting Android devices, the Google Play Store, Chrome, and Search.</p><p>To tackle these anticompetitive issues, the U.S. might push Google to be more transparent about alternative search options and let websites choose whether they want to be part of AI training. The Justice Department is also weighing more extreme steps, like making Google share search data with competitors or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">separating Chrome and Android</a>.</p><p>The DOJ also wants to restrict Google&apos;s ability to form exclusive deals with companies like Apple and Samsung to maintain its search engine as the default. Google currently has partnerships with Samsung to share revenue from the Play Store and with Apple for search traffic on Safari.</p><p>Another bold option being considered would limit Google’s ability to use its products—such as Chrome, Play, and Android—to give Google Search and related services an edge in the market.</p><p>The proposed framework aims to address the issues caused by Google’s control over search distribution, revenue sharing, search result presentation, ad reach and monetization, as well as its extensive data collection and usage practices.</p><p>As expected, Google has pushed back against the proposed antitrust actions, claiming they would undermine user privacy and drastically reshape the company. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s VP of Regulatory Affairs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-framework/" target="_blank">voiced worries</a> about forced data sharing, the possible separation of Chrome or Android, and the challenges of regulating AI tools.</p><p>Google argues that the DOJ’s proposed remedies could hurt consumers, businesses, and developers. The company claims that the demands are overly harsh and extend beyond the scope of the antitrust case.</p><p>The search giant has highlighted its major investments in Chrome and Android, claiming these products offer consumers free access to the web and Google services. The company warns that splitting up Chrome or Android could disrupt their business models, raise device costs, and weaken their ability to compete with Apple.</p><p>The recommendations are still up in the air. Judge Amit Mehta plans to rule on the remedies by August 2025, but if Google appeals, it could delay any lasting impact for several more years.</p>

And while you could go for the arguably better (and more expensive) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/listen-up-the-uber-premium-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-is-25-percent-off-during-prime-big-deal-days">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, your money is probably better spent on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDR2X3M">this Prime Day deal</a> instead.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> normally retails for $999, which is fairly standard for a flagship of this caliber. Not everyone is willing to drop a note on the phone, so this 25% discount should make it a little easier to consider this powerhouse of a phone, bringing the phone down to $749.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S24 Plus is a great all-around phone with a large display, superb 50MP camera, and all-day battery life. At 25% off, you can spend less on this phone than you normally would on the smallest Galaxy 24, but the deal won't last long.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDR2X3M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9a408edd-4ff0-4327-957c-96dda40ba0fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Why do I like the Galaxy S24 Plus so much? The design is giving iPhone, the cameras are giving Pixel, and the battery life is giving Energizer. Many people consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> to be a bit overkill, while the Galaxy S24 is too small and features some fairly low-end specs. The Galaxy S24 Plus is the Goldilocks flagship.</p><p>It comes with a great 50MP triple camera system, and the display is large and vibrant, which is ideal for content. It comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of RAM, so you have plenty of storage for content and memory for juggling apps and utilizing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> features à la <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. And with a nearly 5,000mAh battery and 45W charging support, battery life will rarely be an issue.</p><p>All this is normally less than the surprisingly more expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, and even now, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-galaxy-z-flip-6-prime-day-deal-makes-it-much-easier-for-me-to-recommend">Z Flip 6 Prime Day discount</a>, the Galaxy S24 Plus is still the better deal.</p>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a flagship phone with a large display, great battery life, and access to the latest AI features from Google and Samsung.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don&apos;t like large phones or you want a built-in stylus pen.</p>
<p>Amazon&apos;s October Prime Day is still going strong, but the deals won&apos;t last much longer. There are also plenty of other deals on Android phones that you should also check out before you hit "check out."</p>

Sure, the Fire 7 is not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a> and it certainly isn't going to win any awards for power or innovation, but if you want a simple, portable device for fun or travel, it's an unbeatable pick at this price. </p>

<p>Of course, the Amazon Fire 7 is only a little bit bigger than most Android phones nowadays, so if you need a bigger screen (or you simply <em>must </em>have HD), consider spending a little more to get the premium Fire Max 11 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6"><strong>currently $159.99</strong></a>)</p><p>It's also worth noting that this particular version of the Fire 7 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-are-kindle-and-fire-tablet-special-offers">lockscreen ads</a>, which means Amazon is going to bug you with the occasional banner or ad-supported wallpaper — but only when the device isn't in use. The rest of the time you'll be free to stream content or read an e-book with zero interruptions. </p><p>It's up to you whether these small concessions are worth it, but for me, they're a small price to pay when I'm getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best value Fire tablet</a> for only $50 for the next few days.</p>
