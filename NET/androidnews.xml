<ul><li>Google is revamping Chrome for businesses with Chrome Enterprise Premium, offering advanced security features for a monthly fee.</li><li>Chrome Enterprise Premium offers both a paid and free version. The paid version emphasizes enhanced security features such as data loss prevention and deep malware scans.</li><li>Chrome Enterprise Premium employs context-aware access controls to identify and mitigate potential data leaks, even from unauthorized apps.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> a security makeover for businesses. Called Chrome Enterprise Premium, it adds a bunch of advanced security features for those willing to pay monthly.</p><p>Google has been using enterprise Chrome for a while, allowing IT admins to control things like browser settings and the apps enterprise users use. Chrome Enterprise also offers data protection, malware guards, and phishing protection.</p><p>At $6 a month per user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeenterprise.google/products/chrome-enterprise-premium/" target="_blank">Chrome Enterprise Premium</a> beefs up security even more, recognizing that browsers are now where the big work goes down.</p><p>As users worldwide tap into Chrome on their phones and work devices and deal with various software versions and platforms, Google&apos;s got their back. Chrome Enterprise Premium offers a bunch of tools to keep things locked down tight at every step.</p><p>Chrome Enterprise Premium comes in two flavors: Core, which is free, and Premium. Google is pitching this version as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> that doubles down on online safety, performing deep malware scanning, stopping data leaks in their tracks, and even letting you filter URLs based on what kind of websites they are.</p><p>However, the paid and free Chrome Enterprise versions have some big differences. The Premium tier provides data loss prevention and deep malware scans, but the Core (free) doesn&apos;t. But even with Core, you still get basic stuff like phishing and malware protection.</p><p>There&apos;s some sort of AI magic in there, too, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-chrome-enterprise-premium" target="_blank">Google saying</a> it&apos;s using artificial intelligence to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-remove-malware-from-phone">tackle malware</a> and phishing head-on.</p><p>Chrome Enterprise Premium doesn&apos;t stop there—it kicks Zero Trust up a notch with context-aware access controls. This means it can sniff out potential data leaks, whether from approved apps or ones that IT didn&apos;t give the green light to.</p><p>Google is adding even more controls, too, giving admins the power to implement policies and keep software up-to-date through automatic updates to squash any new bugs that pop up.</p><p>This Chrome edition is also built to stop shady add-ons, making sure hackers can&apos;t sneak in through any cracks. Plus, it plays nice with other Google and third-party security tools to cover all your bases.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirmed that even more of its past-gen devices will receive One UI 6.1 in "early May" with Galaxy AI features.</li><li>The Galaxy S22, Flip 4, Fold 4, and Tab S8 series will gain every Galaxy AI feature aside from Instant Slow-mo for videos.</li><li>The Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3 are only eligible for two Galaxy AI features as those devices' hardware capabilities likely cannot handle much more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has confirmed that several of its older devices from 2021 and 2022 will receive Galaxy AI features in "early May."</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/s22-one-ui-6-1-5%EC%9B%94%EC%B4%88%EC%98%88%EC%A0%95/td-p/26442659">community post</a>, Samsung is preparing to roll out its One UI 6.1 update, packed with Galaxy AI a few devices launched between 2021 and 2022. The company states that while these devices will receive AI tools, some items will be missing.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> series, Flip 4, Fold 4, and the Tab S8 series will receive the same Galaxy AI features as the S23 FE. This means that the devices will gain everything <em>except </em>for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-ai-slow-mo-feature-past-gen">Instant Slow-mo</a> as Samsung notably left the recent FE series out during its confirmation in February.</p><p>The Galaxy S21 series, the Flip 3, and Fold 3 are in the crosshairs of only two Galaxy AI features: Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>" and Chat Assist.</p><p>Aside from the "early May" rollout window, Samsung did not give a more concrete date. However, One UI 6.1 on these older devices may arrive alongside the company&apos;s typical monthly security patch.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s confirmation of Galaxy AI&apos;s arrival on several more past-gen devices comes a day after it revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-language-support-announced">more language support</a> for the software. Samsung teased that more devices would pick up its AI, and the Galaxy S22 was one of the series on our minds. The company&apos;s head of mobile, TM Roh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">stated in March</a> that Samsung was exploring the possibility of Galaxy AI on the two-year-old series.</p><p>The primary issue was hardware, as Galaxy AI heavily relies on that area. That reason alone is likely the reason behind the lack of Instant Slow-mo and the missing features of the Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3.</p><p>More recent phones, like the Galaxy S23 series and last year&apos;s foldables, picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-6-1-galaxy-ai-announcement">One UI 6.1 update</a> at the end of March. The patch brought Live Translate, Samsung&apos;s Generative Edit, and more to owners of eligible devices.</p>

<ul><li>The colors—Mint, Porcelain, Obsidian, and Bay—are similar to those seen in the Pixel 8 series.</li><li>The renders provide a detailed view of the Pixel 8a's design, highlighting its bezels and rounder form factor.</li><li>All color variants of the Pixel 8a are expected to feature a matte texture on the back and side rails.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a"><u>Google Pixel 8a</u></a> just showed up in what seems to be some official renders of the phone, showing it off in four different colors.</p><p>According to the renders shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-8a-colors-leak" target="_blank"><u>AndroidHeadlines</u></a>, the phone will come in Mint, Porcelain, Obsidian, and Bay. We&apos;ve already seen these colors in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review"><u>Pixel 8</u></a> series, and now they&apos;re showing up in the cheaper version too.</p><p>The images also let us see the Pixel 8a from every angle, giving us a good look at the bezels. We saw the front of the phone in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-live-photos-leaked"><u>some real-life pictures a few days ago</u></a>, and the bottom edge looked a bit thicker in those photos.</p><p>Now that the screen is more visible, it&apos;s clear that the bezels are quite a bit larger than those on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, but they&apos;re not much bigger than the ones on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review"><u>Pixel 7a</u></a>.</p><p>All four colors of the Pixel 8a are supposed to have a matte texture on both the back and the side rails, just like previous leaks hinted at.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8a shares a lot of similarities with its flagship siblings, but the main difference you can spot here is the rounded design, which isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. This should make the phone feel more comfortable to hold.</p><p>As for specs, the phone is supposed to pack a 6.1-inch screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, although some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-display-upgrade">rumors are saying it might have a 120Hz display</a>.</p><p>Under the hood, it is likely to draw its power from a Tensor G3 chipset, and a 4,500mAh battery could be keeping the lights on.</p><p>On the back, there&apos;s talk of a 64MP main camera along with a 13MP ultra-wide sensor. While it might not be a huge camera upgrade, the performance should be up there with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">top budget phones</a> money can buy.</p><p>The Pixel 8a might make its debut at Google I/O in May, but there&apos;s no leaked information yet on the exact launch date. As for the price, rumors suggest it might be a bit higher than last year&apos;s model.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music wants to show what your subscribed artists are up to.</li><li>The app is rolling out a new Activity feed, which shows new singles and albums from subscribed artists.</li><li>The feature is currently rolling out for Android and iOS users, but web users have to wait.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music for Android and iOS is getting a new feed dubbed "Activity" that shows up when users hit the notifications bell icon in the music app.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/09/youtube-music-notifications-bell/">9to5Google</a>, it was spotted in the YouTube Music app last month. However, it appears to be rolling out widely to all the app users on both iOS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="D2SrGftM9eyVHWVuEMjzC5" name="Youtube-music-activity-feed-01.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Activity feed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D2SrGftM9eyVHWVuEMjzC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Currently, the YouTube Music app has a notification bell icon, which can be viewed at the top when users are in the "Home" tab. This icon was generally used to roll out app notifications like every other app. However, users would see the new "Activity" feed after the latest update rollout, which shows "updates from artists you subscribe to and other activity will be shown here."</p><p>As 9to5 points out, the Activity feed is showing new singles and albums from the artists that users are subscribed to in reverse chronological order for now. When the rollout becomes more widely available to users, we might see more features added to it, like the ability to see new podcasts from their subscribed channels.</p><p>Also, the feed is likely to be grouped weekly or monthly as it currently shows some of the artists&apos; work under the "This week" section. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="PTR3ohTaqQ5itxm7eA95K5" name="Youtube-music-activity-feed.jpg" alt="YouTube Music Activity feed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTR3ohTaqQ5itxm7eA95K5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right under the new Activity feed, YouTube Music app users can also find the "Suggested for you" feed, where they can subscribe to their favorite artists for whom they haven&apos;t subscribed. As 9to5 notes, this feed is presumably based on their music listening history.</p><p>Artist activity is a familiar feature. Spotify and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> provide a similar feed highlighting the music artists enjoy, particularly the musicians they have followed.</p><p>As for the rollout, it is currently appearing on the YouTube Music app as aforementioned, and it is nowhere to be seen on the YouTube Music for web just yet.</p>

The stylus here is also pretty basic, there&apos;s no IP rating, and we weren&apos;t particularly impressed by the phone&apos;s selfie camera. Lastly, it&apos;s worth remembering that Motorola will probably drop the Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) at some point later this year (probably late summer), so if you can wait, that phone is likely to be superior to this model.</p><p>Still, if you want a great stylus phone experience today and you don&apos;t want to deal with Samsung&apos;s hefty price tags, this Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) deal might be the perfect choice.</p>

<p><em>As we mentioned above, the Moto 5G Stylus doesn&apos;t come with an IP rating, so if you want to keep your new phone extra safe, consider buying one of the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-cases-for-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023"><em>best Moto G Stylus 5G cases</em></a><em> before your package arrives. </em></p>

I was addicted, and the only cure was one more round. C-Smash VRS is the epitome of an arcade classic, redesigned and reformulated for at-home VR systems after decades of relegation to now-defunct arcades.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a Sega classic from the instant you start it up, with music by Rez veterans and addictive, high-score-based gameplay to match. But this isn&apos;t the only time I&apos;ve found myself practically addicted to a VR game where I smash a ball with some kind of racket.</p><p>Before C-Smash, it was Racket Club, a social Squash/Pickleball hybrid with a community that&apos;s as friendly as it is competitive and immediately landed on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/12">best Meta Quest games</a> when it debuted last Fall. Beyond these two titles, there&apos;s a notable enthusiast community that loves playing other racket games like Eleven Table Tennis, Pickleball One, Cybrix, Racket Fury, and several others.</p><p>Like Wii Sports, games that revolve around existing sports tend to be the most accessible experiences because you don&apos;t have to re-teach gamers what to do. People already know how to hit a ball with a tennis racket or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">a golf club</a>, and like the Wii, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> enhance the experience and make it feel even more real.</p>

<p>C-Smash VRS originally launched as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> exclusive game last Spring. It&apos;s a complete reimagining of the classic Dreamcast game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfnCyHqbc4Y">Cosmic Smash</a>, which puts players on one side of a Squash-sized court while blocks are placed on the other side.</p><p>If you&apos;ve ever played the classic Atari game Breakout — or one of its many clones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=breakout.brick.breaker.classic">on the Google Play store</a> — you&apos;ll immediately understand the concept. It&apos;s your job to lob the ball across the court and take out the targets as fast as possible. C-Smash is a classic arcade game through and through, awarding high scores and worldwide leaderboard placement for the best players.</p><p>The single-player campaign sees you making your way through the stars with its quirky Space Channel 5-esque sci-fi theme that feels a bit like it came out of the 1960s. Before the rounds begin, you&apos;ll choose your pathway through a randomized solar system that&apos;s filled with power-up planets, each of which will present a different challenge to clear out bricks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4fGRewk5zgcosJPreaJoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the soundtrack is superb, ushering in a wave of catchy tunes and funky beats by the ever-amazing DJ Ken Ishii. If you don&apos;t immediately recognize the name, know that he was behind the soundtracks for Sega classics like Lumines and Rez. The game feels Sega through and through, and for a guy who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I&apos;m all here for it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As a kid who grew up as a Sega Genesis fanboy, I'm all here for C-Smash's incredible soundtrack and arcade gameplay.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each planet features a different court theme and power-ups like multiball will no doubt excite pinball fans as they watch dozens of balls explode from those special bricks and clear out the entire court in seconds. I managed to get a top-5 high score worldwide in one of these multiball rounds before C-Smash VRS went public on Quest last Friday, although I doubt I&apos;m still on the leaderboard at this point.</p><p>Because each court is wider than you&apos;ll likely be able to move in your home space, you&apos;ll use the left controller stick to slide your character left and right to help yourself reach even the widest shots from the backplane.</p><p>I played the game on the PSVR 2 when it came out but decided I wasn&apos;t a fan of games that make you move around as much, given that the PSVR 2 has a cable I tend to trip over. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> is completely wireless, I never once felt like I was being pulled out of the experience just to remember not to trip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV" name="c-smash-vrs-official-screenshot-02.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of C-Smash VRS on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygMYy3ScxjgRRJcQ8M5WeV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RapidEyeMovers)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But C-Smash isn&apos;t just a single-player experience, and for me, that&apos;s where the real longevity comes into play. C-Smash VRS features several different multiplayer modes that put players on courts that face each other, tasking them with clearing or claiming all the bricks before the other player.</p><p>The mode&apos;s one weakness is that there&apos;s no cross-play at the moment, but the team confirmed that it&apos;s something they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/1bg5b9o/comment/kv6d814">looking at implementing</a> in the future. In fact, that very Reddit thread outlines a new C-Smash Saturday meetup program the team at RapidEyeMovers holds every Saturday at 1pm PT / 4pm ET / 8pm GMT. It&apos;s perfect if you&apos;re looking for a little mid-day breakup of a lazy Saturday and it&apos;s sure to get your heart pumping.</p>
<h2 id="the-wii-sports-effect-2">The Wii Sports effect</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1847px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.82%;"><img id="qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6" name="wii-sports-tennis.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Wii Sports tennis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qwC7ppPkU4DrsAEPbYnFF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1847" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screenshot by Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that Wii Sports sold more Wii consoles than any other game. The game was a free pack-in with every Wii sold in the West, proving the importance of including an accessible, killer app with every system.</p><p>Everyone loved Wii Sports. Gamers, non-gamers, young people, old people, etc. It was a game that brought people together for some fun physical activity in the living room and was instantly playable no matter your skill level. The game felt like pure magic and its influence can be spotted in many VR games to date.</p><p>In the same way, many VR sports games can offer extremely accessible gameplay by keeping things simple. C-Smash VRS is slightly more complicated than something like Wii Sports because it&apos;s more "video gamey," but that&apos;s why there are games like Racket Club.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHwNrFR2Fiw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>When you start up Racket Club, you&apos;re not greeted with a complicated menu system or a lot of nonsense hoops to run through. You can immediately head out the door and be placed into a public lobby filled with players ready to show you the ropes. The game instantly makes sense and it only takes a few seconds to understand the nuances that make it different from other racket games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Racket Club's friendly community is as good as the game itself.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just like C-Smash, you&apos;ll be hitting a ball with a racket and bouncing it off a wall, but unlike C-Smash, your opponents will hit the ball right back at you. Each court is only as big as the play space you&apos;re standing in which means you won&apos;t need to virtually move your character around with a joystick.</p><p>The latest update lets you customize and adjust the racket itself, too, helping players of all kinds feel comfortable holding the virtual racket the way they want to. I always take some time to adjust to each racket game&apos;s holding angle, so this was a particularly refreshing update for me.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZu-TcE4JDQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Racket Club&apos;s endearing fan base ensures you&apos;ll always have a good time. Players have always been super friendly and talkative, willing to play a few practice rounds to warm you up, and even gracious when they lose.</p><p>Unironically, it comes from the same developers that put together Demeo, a game that boasts one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">friendliest online communities</a> I&apos;ve ever experienced. The internet is filled to the brim with jerks and trolls, but I have yet to have a bad experience with either of these titles from Resolution Games.</p><p>But while Wii Sports&apos; gameplay largely plateaus after a short time, Racket Club&apos;s simple-to-learn mechanics are more rewarding the more time you put into the game. The game has a true experience curve that feels realistic in both single-player and multiplayer modes, thanks to the company&apos;s unique use of deep learning AI for its computer-controlled players.</p><p>That means no matter if you want to play through the game&apos;s deep single-player campaign mode or head straight online and play against real human players, you&apos;re bound to have a rewarding experience. Couple that with the safety that mixed-reality gameplay delivers — you can play far better when you&apos;re not worried about smashing your TV — and it&apos;s clear that Racket Club is the Wii Sports Tennis successor we&apos;ve been looking for.</p>

<p>Google bundles a few virtual private network (VPN) services with its other offerings, but one of those is going away soon. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-and-use-your-google-one-vpn">Google One VPN</a>, the VPN service included with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription tiers, will shut down in the coming months. Luckily, the company will not make any changes to the other VPNs it offers through other programs, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Pixel phone</a> purchases or Google Fi cellular plans. </p><p>The move was communicated to Google One subscribers Thursday, April 11 in an email viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. "With a focus on providing the most in-demand features and benefits, we&apos;re discontinuing free shipping for select print orders from Google Photos starting on May 15 and VPN by Google One later this year," the email said. </p><p>Google&apos;s idea with the Google One VPN was to bolster its subscription offerings while fulfilling a need for privacy on the web. The feature was first a perk of the Google One Premium plan, but it has been available on all Google One plans since early last year. However, the feature wasn&apos;t all that popular, at least according to Google.</p><p>The company is "discontinuing the VPN feature as [it] found people simply weren&apos;t using it," according to a statement provided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. </p><p>Again, Google reiterated the need to shift focus toward features that Google One subscribers make the most out of. This is the same reason the company gave when it decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">cut 17 features from Google Assistant</a> in January.</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Google is keeping its original promise to owners of Pixel 7 series phones and newer. A separate VPN service, called Pixel VPN, is included on those devices for five years. Even with the discontinuation of the Google One VPN, the Pixel VPN will still be available. In fact, Google is expanding Pixel VPN to run on the Pixel 7 series and Pixel Fold without needing the Google One app. This functionality first appeared on the Pixel 8 series and is making its way to older devices in June. </p><p>The VPN included with Google Fi cellular plans is also unaffected, meaning that there are still a few ways to get VPN service through Google. However, anyone reliant on the Google One VPN who doesn&apos;t have a new Pixel or Google Fi service will need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn-apps-android">switch to another provider</a>. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube is testing a redesigned video player on the web that moves the title and comments to the sidebar. </li><li>A social media account for the site confirmed that this new view is only a test for now. </li><li>Users expressed disdain for the feature, and YouTube suggested they submit feedback through its website. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is experimenting with new ways to show video players on the web, and the latest one could represent one of the biggest UI changes in years. Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-show-you-shorts-in-more-places-on-the-web">YouTube Shorts</a> started appearing in the recommended videos sidebar for some users. Now, an even more drastic change is showing up for a limited number of users. The latest redesign test moves the title, description, and comments to the sidebar and shifts recommended videos under the currently playing one.</p><p>Though this user-interface change is indeed only a test, users aren&apos;t thrilled about it for now. The redesign drew the attention of all the major social media sites, including X (formerly Twitter), Threads, and Reddit. One user on Threads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@_brianhamilton/post/C5lsnJMJbVN/?xmt=AQGzVSzhTSKNliKn4PQrXcdcKf5YRpgXU_JyW9a9yL3KYg" target="_blank">Brian Hamilton</a>, shared a screenshot of the visual overhaul, and over 100 mostly negative replies ensued. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.19%;"><img id="A4ZdkP7yqezwgGJtVAvFXi" name="YouTube-Sidebar-Redesign-Test.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a YouTube redesign test." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4ZdkP7yqezwgGJtVAvFXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="1408" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: _brianhamilton / Threads)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The benefit of this change appears to be that you get to see more of the video title, comments, and description. Meanwhile, less recommended videos appear on the same page as your now-playing content. Instead of a long list of recommended videos with smaller thumbnails and titles, YouTube shows three recommended videos with larger thumbnails and titles in this test.</p><p>However, users responded to this change in a similar way to YouTube&apos;s last test with YouTube Shorts. In both cases, the bigger thumbnails for recommended videos were found to be distracting from the main content. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">jumping in! it sounds like you’re seeing an experiment/test feature. diff teams at YouTube often test new ways to improve features & experiences. you can share your feedback here: https://t.co/NnQpe4fbHH also, you can check out recent experiments here: https://t.co/p3uu6MOOr2<a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1778196636113531115">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The Team YouTube account on X clarified that this is an experimental test feature that isn&apos;t rolling out for everyone yet. The account advises users to submit their feedback through their YouTube account. To do so, users can click on their profile picture on the YouTube site and select <strong>Send feedback</strong>. After writing feedback or including a screenshot, you can hit <strong>Send</strong> to submit your thoughts to Google. </p><p>Although the redesigned YouTube video player isn&apos;t available to all users and Google accounts on the web, the social media buzz around the change suggests that it is somewhat widespread. Currently, it looks like YouTube is testing a few new ways to improve the web video player, so we&apos;ll be curious to see which—if any—of these tests survive. </p>

<p>Those numbers might not mean a lot on their own, but when we stack them up against last year&apos;s Xperia 1 V, things start to get interesting. Compared to its predecessor, the new Xperia 1 VI looks like it&apos;ll be a tad thicker, but it&apos;ll also be a bit shorter and wider. So, we&apos;re looking at a more compact and conventional setup this time around.</p><p>With this slight size tweak, there&apos;s a chance the phone&apos;s aspect ratio could shift to 19.5:9. Now, there&apos;s been chatter that Sony might ditch the beloved 21:9 display for the first time since it introduced the Xperia 1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sony-xperia-5">Xperia 5</a> series back in 2019. If that turns out to be true, fans who dig that 21:9 aspect ratio might feel a bit let down by Sony&apos;s call.</p><p>Xperia phones have been rocking a 21:9 ratio for a while. But, with leaks hinting that Sony might be switching things up to a more standard 19.5:9 screen, like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, it&apos;s starting to look like this change is pretty much locked in.</p><p>The new Xperia phone is also rumored to come with a 2K+ or Quad HD+ display, rocking around 3200 x 1440 pixels. That&apos;s a step down from the 4K panels we&apos;ve seen in previous models.</p><p>The upcoming phone is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors" target="_blank">pack a 2K+ or Quad HD+ panel instead of a 4K panel</a> in the previous models.</p><p>Pinning down the exact resolution just from a render might be a bit of a stretch. And as for that aspect ratio change we&apos;re speculating about based on the leaked Sony Xperia 1 VI render, well, only time will tell if it&apos;s the real deal.</p>

<p>When it comes to tablets and foldables, it&apos;s tough to argue against the idea that Samsung is offering the best experience. Samsung&apos;s "everything but the kitchen sink" approach is finally paying off in a big way now that we&apos;re out of the dark days of TouchWiz. And while the company continues to improve the software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> remains a key selling point for those who want a truly "all-in-one" device, which is why I think it should be the default on tablets.</p><p>DeX flies under the radar, as it&apos;s almost never mentioned whenever a new flagship device is unveiled. However, changes and improvements are regularly made in an effort to let you turn your device into a portable computer.</p><p>The most recent overhaul came with the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a>, which introduced the "New DeX" interface. Instead of being provided with a completely different Home Screen and interface, New DeX basically feels like a super-charged version of what you get out of the box on something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You might even have a hard time noticing that you're even using "New DeX."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When activated, your Home Screen remains the same, including your app layout and any widgets that you might have added. But, as soon as you open an app, you&apos;ll immediately notice something different. Instead of the app taking up your entire screen, as it did before, it opens up in an app window, like it would if you were using "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Classic DeX</a>."</p><p>This is great for those who want to open multiple apps at the same time without dealing with the annoyances of split-screen. You still have access to those capabilities, but essentially, you&apos;re given much more flexibility than the traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> experience. The taskbar also remains persistent, but even your notifications and Quick Settings toggles are available just by swiping down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-desktop.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra on desk in DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oZ6tHCLzssh9ruJPDDVYfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m hoping for is that Samsung will introduce this "New DeX" as the default interface on new tablets and maybe even foldables like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It combines the best of both worlds, giving us the ability to use widgets on the Home Screen while making it easy to open multiple apps in their own separate windows. Then, Samsung can ditch the "New" and "Classic" monikers while still giving us access to both.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think this is what&apos;s actually going to happen. Instead, I&apos;m of the mindset that Samsung is going to end up ditching the DeX that we&apos;ve all come to know and love over the years. The "New DeX" will just become "DeX," while the stock launcher experience will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a fan of the "Classic DeX" interface, then you might be a bit concerned that it&apos;s going away. Thankfully, that&apos;s not the case, at least for the time being. Samsung makes it possible to switch from "New" to "Classic," but you&apos;ll have to do a little bit of digging.</p><p>This New DeX experience also doesn&apos;t replicate a desktop experience as well, especially if you connect your tablet to an external monitor. For one, the only display settings option is to choose between "Mirror tablet screen" or "Use screens separately." Even if you choose the latter, New DeX doesn&apos;t scale the display properly, meaning that you&apos;re often left with black bars on either side.</p>

<p>By in large, this just automatically enables the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/use-multi-window-mode-samsung-galaxy-tab-s8">Multi window for all apps</a>" feature that&apos;s already available in the Labs section of the Settings app. There are a few other minor differences, such as the taskbar being able to hold more than four recently used apps. But, it&apos;s not really something that I would describe as being part of the "DeX" experience.</p><p>You might be asking yourself, "Would Samsung actually ditch "Classic DeX?" Well, the answer is quite simple. Yes, because it likes to make money. Samsung already sells its own lineup of laptops, and if you buy a tablet that basically does the same thing as a laptop but has better battery life, it loses out on potential sales. This is especially true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a> with its 14.6-inch AMOLED display, and when paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-book-cover-keyboard-dont-buy">Book Cover Keyboard</a>, it is about as close as it gets to having an Android-powered Surface competitor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Book 4 360</a> is probably the closest comparison to make, as it&apos;s a 2-in-1 laptop with a touchscreen display. Pricing starts at $1,099 for the Intel Core 5 model, paired with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. There&apos;s also the Core 7 variant, priced at $1,349, but that bumps the RAM up to 16GB and comes with either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn" name="samsung-galaxy-book-4-series-press-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book 4 series lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pcrz2V9WKUi8wPCqaJueMn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1392" height="783" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, on the other hand, starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage, maxing out with 1TB for $1,619. Then, you&apos;re looking at another $350 for the Book Cover Keyboard, so on the surface, the Book 4 360 is a better deal. But that&apos;s only part of the story, as the Book 4 360 falls short of the Tab S9 Ultra in a few ways.</p><p>For one, while the screen is larger, it&apos;s also limited to a 1080p resolution and is capped at a 60Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the Tab S9 Ultra is equipped with a smaller display, making it better for portability, along with offering a better viewing and gaming experience thanks to the AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Not to mention that the battery on your Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra will last for days, whereas the Book 4 360 <em>might</em> make it through a day, maybe two.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra might be expensive, but it's still a better value than some of Samsung's best laptops.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I wish I could tell you what the future holds and that Samsung will leave Classic DeX alone, aside from introducing new features. Sadly, I don&apos;t have a crystal ball and have no clue what Samsung&apos;s long-term plans are with New DeX.</p><p>But there&apos;s a reason why I barely ever recommend anything other than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a> to those who don&apos;t want an iPad. That&apos;s because the majority of Android tablets are a mixed bag of disappointment. Whether it&apos;s because they lack polish, aren&apos;t updated very often, or are just downright bad. Unless something dramatic happens, Galaxy Tabs will remain my go-to recommendation, even if "Classic DeX" is removed, but it will be much tougher.</p><p>Samsung, please don&apos;t ruin a good thing, even if your analytics show that DeX isn&apos;t used by the vast majority of the user base.</p>
