                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It feels like Vivo can do no wrong in 2024; the brand consistently delivered great products throughout the course of the year, offering meaningful upgrades and much-needed software tweaks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> continues to be one of the strongest camera packages available today, and thanks to Zeiss integration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a> is one of the best shooters in the mid-range segment.</p><p>While Vivo made foldables in the past, they&apos;ve been limited to its home market — until now. The X Fold3 Pro is now available in select regions in Southeast Asia, and as a result, it now comes with the global Funtouch OS instead of the China-focused Origin OS.</p><p>There&apos;s clearly a lot to like with the device; it has the biggest and brightest panels of any foldable, ultrasonic modules embedded inside the inner and outer display, one of the best cameras in this category, and the largest battery with the best charging tech. I used the X Fold3 Pro for just over a month, and here&apos;s why I think it is the foldable to beat.</p>

<p>Vivo unveiled the X Fold3 and X Fold3 Pro in China back in Q1 2024, and the Pro variant made its global debut in June. It is now available in India and Indonesia in addition to China. While the X Fold3 Pro is available in three configurations in China — 12GB/256GB, 16GB/512GB, and 16GB/1TB — Vivo is just bringing the middle variant to global markets.</p><p>That&apos;s understandable, as the 16GB/512GB edition hits the sweet spot in terms of storage, and coming in at ₹1,59,999 ($1,910), the foldable manages to undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which retails in the country for ₹1,76,999 ($2,112). I received the Indian variant of the X Fold3 Pro, and while there is a white variant on sale in China, the brand is selling the Celestial Black model as standard in global markets.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold3-pro-design"><span>Vivo X Fold3 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kaqHmpQPfRif2R2PXyxfWe" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-1.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kaqHmpQPfRif2R2PXyxfWe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the third iteration of Vivo&apos;s foldable efforts, and it shows. The X Fold3 Pro is considerably thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and what I like best about the design is that Vivo somehow managed to cram sizeable panels both inside and out while still maintaining a svelte overall profile.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7zHaguMB7eFtDMrq794VUm" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zHaguMB7eFtDMrq794VUm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With an unfolded thickness of 5.2mm and 11.2mm when folded, the X Fold3 Pro handily beats the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> in this area (5.6mm and 12.1mm). It is 3g lighter as well while offering a 5700mAh battery — the largest in this segment yet. Honor&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> is still the thinnest foldable I used this year, coming in at 4.8mm, but it doesn&apos;t have as large a battery.</p>

<p>The weight savings are down to a redesigned hinge that has much smoother articulation — and is much more durable. It is rated at 500,000 unlocks, and stays semi-folded at any angle between 30 to 165 degrees, giving you the ability to take interesting photos and videos. What I like most is that you get a feature similar to Standby Mode when the panel is at a semi-folded angle. Oh, and the hinge closes fully flat with no visible gap.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LKaPdMseyFwXEWzrwPkCkf" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-7.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LKaPdMseyFwXEWzrwPkCkf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo mostly kept things simple with the back design, and the foldable gets the usual glass pane. The only point of differentiation is the oversized camera module that&apos;s in line with the designs of the X100 Ultra and Pro. Like other Vivo phones, you get the Xtreme Imagination tagline etched at the back; this time, it&apos;s on the aluminum edge and not quite as noticeable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZfM4tSC9JC9vyjgjYhDrTi" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-21.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZfM4tSC9JC9vyjgjYhDrTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The large camera island has a gold accent, and it juts out considerably. While this isn&apos;t an issue when the device is folded, it leads to a wobble when using the inner panel against a table. The bundled case mitigates this issue to an extent, but it is still irksome.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> has a flashier design at the back thanks to the distinctive camera housing and generous use of leather, but of the two, I&apos;m partial to the X Fold3 Pro; it delivers larger displays inside and out, and that&apos;s the whole point of a foldable. Vivo didn&apos;t omit the essentials either; the X Fold3 Pro includes IPX8 ingress protection as standard, and that allows it to weather the elements that much better.</p><p>Rounding out the design, there&apos;s a slider on the left that allows you to toggle silent mode. It&apos;s not as useful as the alert slider, but it isn&apos;t hard to imagine Vivo phones getting the feature in subsequent releases.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold3-pro-displays"><span>Vivo X Fold3 Pro: Displays</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7zHaguMB7eFtDMrq794VUm" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zHaguMB7eFtDMrq794VUm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X Fold3 Pro has a 6.53-inch outer display that folds out to an 8.03-inch inner panel, and that&apos;s noticeably bigger than what you get with the Z Fold 6 (7.6 inches). The outer panel has Armor Glass coating, and thanks to a 21:9 ration and resolution of 2748 x 1172, it is similar to using a regular phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LeSDhR734KFACRzFcZ7UPh" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-15.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeSDhR734KFACRzFcZ7UPh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inner panel gets a resolution of 2480 x 2200, and both the inner and outer screens go up to 120Hz. But the defining point is the brightness; the X Fold3 Pro gets noticeably brighter than any other foldable I used, and this is true for both the inner and outer panels. While they go up to 4,500 nits in HDR content, it&apos;s in auto mode where I clearly saw the difference next to the Magic V2 and other 2024 releases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rRZKrDzsCxouvVQfGwPkhi" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-19.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRZKrDzsCxouvVQfGwPkhi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a crease on the inner 8.03-inch panel, but it isn&apos;t particularly noticeable, and I ignored it after three days of use. While you can make out the crease, it is shallower than that on the Z Fold 6, and doesn&apos;t affect usability in any meaningful way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zm6umM28pbLnrkD3bdiL4k" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-28.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zm6umM28pbLnrkD3bdiL4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s Dolby Vision as well, and I didn&apos;t see any issues streaming HDR content in Netflix. Vivo absolutely nailed the brief in this regard, and the X Fold3 Pro has the best color accuracy and brightness of any foldable today. The onboard sound is pretty decent, and it holds up well enough in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NDRoyDz52ha89fJUnEoGYj" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-29.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NDRoyDz52ha89fJUnEoGYj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite feature is the inclusion of ultrasonic fingerprint sensors. While I don&apos;t usually like ultrasonic modules, Vivo uses Goodix sensors in its devices, and they&apos;re just as fast and reliable as optical modules while having a larger recognition area. What&apos;s noteworthy is that Vivo used two sensors — underneath each panel — and that gives the X Fold3 Pro a distinct edge over most of its rivals. The Z Fold 6 still has a side-mounted sensor, and it looks archaic.</p><p>There&apos;s plenty of customizability when it comes to colors and always-on styles, and Vivo&apos;s custom lighting effects are intact here, giving you extensive options to tailor the device to your preferences.</p>

<p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables of 2024</a>, the X Fold3 Pro is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. Vivo is launching a single variant globally, and the unit has 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a known quantity at this point, and having used it on over a dozen devices, I can safely say that it is one of Qualcomm&apos;s best chipsets to date. It has noticeable performance gains over last year, and the best part is that it has terrific efficiency.</p><p>The reason I delayed this review is that the device had buggy software out of the box; it was prone to freezing and random glitches, but a subsequent software update rolled out at the start of July sorted out the issues. Following that, I didn&apos;t notice any lag or slowdowns in daily use, and it has been just as reliable as other Vivo devices I used this year.</p>

<p>Even though they share the same Qualcomm silicon, most foldables aren&apos;t set up for extended gaming sessions, and that&apos;s down to thermal management and throttling. Astonishingly, it wasn&apos;t an issue on the X Fold3 Pro, and it held up incredibly well even in marathon gaming sessions. There was no overheating, I got consistent framerates, and there wasn&apos;t any noticeable jitter.</p><p>In fact, its stability score of 89.9% in 3DMark&apos;s latest Steel Nomad Light test is one of the highest of any phones I tested, foldable or otherwise. Similarly impressive is the fact that it didn&apos;t cross 40 degrees Celsius; most devices with the 8 Gen 3 hit the 46-degree mark in this test.</p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing elsewhere; the device gets a Wi-Fi 7 modem, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, dual-band GPS, global Sub-6 5G bands, USB-C 3.2, and the entire suite of AptX codecs. The vibration motor is one of the best on a foldable, and it has exquisite feedback when navigating the interface and using the keyboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsrdw7aw9BgXiq3oSjhZqg" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-14.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsrdw7aw9BgXiq3oSjhZqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the rest of the hardware is noteworthy in its own right, where the X Fold3 Pro truly shines is the battery life. Thanks to a massive 5700mAh battery, the foldable manages to easily last a day and a half between charges, and even with heavy use, I didn&apos;t feel the need to plug in the device before the end of the day. That&apos;s a huge achievement, and no other foldable measures up to the X Fold3 Pro in this regard.</p><p>When you need to charge the device, there&apos;s 100W charging, with Vivo bundling its 120W FlashCharge charger in the box. It takes just over 35 minutes to fully charge the battery on the device, and that&apos;s a feat in and of itself. Like Honor, Vivo is using  silicon-carbide tech to prolong battery longevity, so there shouldn&apos;t be any noticeable degradation even after several years of use.</p><p>Of course, you get 50W wireless charging as well, but I wasn&apos;t able to test that out as I didn&apos;t have the requisite charger. That said, the device went up to 10W over a standard Qi mat, and it has reverse charging — ideal if you need to charge accessories on the go.</p>

<p>Vivo went with what is arguably one of the best camera packages on a foldable yet, with the X Fold3 Pro featuring a 50MP OmniVision OV50H main camera, a 50MP wide-angle lens, and a 64MP zoom camera with 3x optical zoom. There are two 32MP cameras underneath each panel, and just like the X100 Pro, all the modules are tuned by Zeiss.</p><p>The camera interface itself will be familiar if you&apos;ve used a Vivo phone in the past, with the shooting modes at the bottom and all the requisite toggles and filters scattered around the viewfinder. You can easily change between the lenses, and there are three distinct color modes available: Vivid, Textured, and Zeiss Natural. Vivid is selected by default, and it produces saturated shots that look great. If you want life-like colors, the Zeiss Natural mode is the one to choose.</p><p>When it comes to video, you get 4K60 on all the cameras at the back, and the Cinematic Portrait mode does a great job when it comes to blurring the background on the go. There&apos;s an Ultra Stabilization mode that minimizes motion when shooting handheld, but it&apos;s limited to 1080p.</p>

<p>The X Fold3 Pro is among the best in this category at daylight photos. Resultant shots have plenty of detail and dynamic range, and while colors tend to be overly saturated, they look great. The wide-angle lens is decent enough, but it just isn&apos;t as good as the X100 Ultra or even the X100 Pro in this regard. It still measures up to other foldables, but Vivo should have used the same module as the X100 Pro.</p><p>Thankfully, the telephoto lens has no shortcomings. It takes fantastic photos at 3x and 6x, and I got usable shots up to 10x without any issues. While it&apos;s great to be able to shoot at 3x and 6x, what I like about the camera is its ability to take stellar portrait shots. While it isn&apos;t on quite on the same level as the Find X7 Ultra or the Magic 6 Pro, the X Fold3 Pro does a better job in this area than any other foldable I used.</p><p>The trio of cameras does a standout job even in low-light situations, and while the wide-angle lens has visible noise, the shots are still usable. I still prefer the X100 Ultra overall, but when it comes to foldables, the X Fold3 Pro has a distinct lead over the Z Fold 6 and Magic V2. </p>

<p>The X Fold3 Pro runs Funtouch OS 14 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and the software itself is nearly identical to what you get on the X100 Pro or V30 series. Vivo polished the interface in the last 12 months, and the UI feels modern and elegant as a result. There is plenty of customizability, and while I like the interface as a whole, there are a few legacy features that are irksome.</p><p>Memory management is usually on the aggressive side, so anything running in the background is usually restricted after an hour or two, and you&apos;ll need to re-launch it. I didn&apos;t see any issues with notifications, and I like that there&apos;s a unified notification pane that also includes the quick toggles. Other Chinese brands are switching to a split pane, but Vivo thankfully hasn&apos;t followed suit — yet.</p>

<p>There are several foldable-focused features on the device that allow you to take advantage of the tablet-sized panel. The dock sits at the bottom of the screen and is great at switching between apps, and you can easily launch split-screen multitasking. The ability to have the device in a semi-folded state and run two utilities side-by-side is great, and it is handy when taking photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QUgJSM4ES5whybQa7BxYQo" name="vivo-x-fold-3-pro-30.jpg" alt="Vivo X Fold3 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUgJSM4ES5whybQa7BxYQo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the month I used the X Fold3 Pro, Vivo rolled out two software updates; one was to address system stability issues, and the second was aimed at camera tweaks. Vivo in general is doing a much better job with software updates, and my X100 Pro unit has consistently picked up security patches and camera updates over the course of 2024.</p><p>The biggest issue in this area is that the X Fold3 Pro will receive just three years of Android updates and four years of security patches, and that just isn&apos;t enough for a foldable. Samsung offers more than double the number of updates on the Z Fold 6, and most other Chinese manufacturers are now rolling out at least four Android OS updates and six years of security updates, so Vivo needs to change its stance.</p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the 800-pound gorilla in this segment, and while the brand has the overwhelming majority of the market share, the device itself isn&apos;t quite as good as other foldables. Vivo&apos;s offering has much better battery life and cameras, bigger panels that get brighter, and a lighter design. The biggest issue is that Vivo doesn&apos;t sell the X Fold3 Pro in the U.S. or most western markets, and as a result, the Z Fold 6 becomes the default choice.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in seeing what Honor does with the Magic V3. The Magic V2 is still one of my favorite foldables of 2024, and the V3 is thinner, lighter, and has better cameras at the back.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a foldable that's thin and light</li><li>You need all the extras</li><li>You need standout cameras with versatile lenses</li><li>You want the largest displays in this segment</li><li>You need the best battery life</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want stylus integration</li><li>You need seven years of updates</li></ul>
<p>The X Fold3 Pro showcases what&apos;s possible with foldables; the svelte design means it isn&apos;t that much larger than a regular phone, but you still get two usable screens, and the panels are among the best in this segment. The same is true of the cameras, and they manage to take outstanding photos and videos in just about any situation. With most other foldables I&apos;ve used in 2024, there&apos;s the distinct feeling that the cameras aren&apos;t quite on par with flagships, but that isn&apos;t the case here.</p><p>There isn&apos;t anything missing on the hardware front either, and the X Fold3 Pro manages to do a standout job during extended gaming sessions. Battery life is another area where there are no problems, with the device easily lasting over a day even with heavy use — I can&apos;t say the same for any other foldable.</p><p>In fact, the only point of contention is the software update guarantee; with Google and Samsung offering seven years of updates, three years is no longer enough in this category. Vivo has to do better if it wants to measure up against Samsung in this regard, because from a hardware point of view, the X Fold3 Pro has considerable upgrades over just about every foldable available today.</p><p>The software is decent enough in its own right, and the only limitation is the update guarantee — if Vivo is able to make amends in that area, the X Fold3 Pro has what it takes to beat the best in this segment.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's new charger for the Pixel 9 series may feature a vertical design, which could save space and avoid cable tripping hazards.</li><li>The European version has extending prongs, while the US model is expected to be smaller with fixed prongs.</li><li>The new charger could also cost more than the current $25 30W model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> event just around the corner, the leaks are flowing nonstop. While the Pixel 9 models are grabbing the headlines, a new leak uncovers the upcoming 45W USB-C charger in the flesh.</p><p>Leaker @MysteryLupin on X (formerly Twitter) has shared some images of the new 45W charging brick, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/31/pixel-9-battery-life-charging/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Unlike the usual horizontal design of charger bricks, this new one looks to be vertical when plugged in. This could mean better space-saving compared to the current 30W model.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this design means your charging cable won’t stick out from the back of the plug, so it won’t be a tripping hazard for anyone walking by.</p><p>However, the charging cable for your Pixel 9 might not have the longest reach. Nevertheless, the new charger’s compact and stylish design is a step up from the old 30W brick, which was pretty much just a clunky block.</p><p>This follows a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-ncc-3461263/" target="_blank">leak of the charger&apos;s U.S. variant</a> from Taiwan’s NCC over a month ago, which also features a vertical design. The key difference is that the prongs on the European model extend out from the charger’s body.</p><p>The charger swaps out the classic square look for a sleeker, oval shape, matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-pixel-9-leak-ruins-the-suspense-ahead-of-googles-big-event">design cues of the upcoming Pixel phones</a>.</p>

<p>The leaked image reveals the European version of the charger, but the US variant is likely to be smaller and sport fixed prongs rather than the foldable design.</p><p>Recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-storage" target="_blank">leaks</a> hint at impressive charging speeds for the Pixel 9 series. The standard models could hit 55% charge in just 30 minutes with the new 45W adapter, while the Pro XL might even reach 70%.</p><p>Google’s current 30W USB-C charger goes for $25, so with the boost to 45W, the new model will likely cost a bit more. We’ll get the exact price at Google’s event on August 13.</p><p>Before jumping on Google&apos;s new 45W USB-C charger, check out other high-powered options. Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">third-party chargers</a> offer similar or higher wattage and often come with multiple USB-C ports for charging more devices at once.</p>

<p>Judge Amit P. Mehta has decided that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">Google is a monopoly</a> when it comes to the search and advertising markets. If you use a phone or a computer, you probably agree with that. This is big news and is the first of the Department of Justice&apos;s big tech anti-trust trials. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-faces-another-antitrust-lawsuit-illegal-monolopy-targeted-ads">Google has another one coming</a>, as does Apple, Amazon, and Meta. </p><p>A Google spokesperson <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">gave Android Central the following statement</a> from Kent Walker, Google&apos;s president of Global Affairs, in response to the ruling:<br>
<br>
"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court&apos;s finding that Google is &apos;the industry&apos;s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,&apos; that Google &apos;has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,&apos; &apos;has continued to innovate in search&apos; and that &apos;Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google&apos;s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google&apos;s to be superior.&apos;"</p><p>Reading this, I think Google is right, and its search product is the best. I&apos;m not sure if hundreds of millions of people use it because they trust Google or because it&apos;s the default, which supports the court&apos;s findings. A lot of people don&apos;t know if Google Search is the best because they haven&apos;t been exposed to alternative options.</p>
<p>Each company has its own set of online fans and detractors. As I type this, people are busy in online comments and on social media arguing why this is unfair and why it&apos;s not. </p><p>I&apos;m not a lawyer, not even close. That means much of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896">286-page-long court decision</a> reads like it&apos;s in another language to me. I get the gist of some of it and think some of the findings are valid, and some may not be. </p><p>Then again, I&apos;m not a lawyer. I&apos;m a cowboy who wrangles words instead of steers.</p>
<p>Some people are lawyers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">have a handle on what all those pages mean</a> and if you are curious about what Google has done and how it broke the law, you should read what they have to say about it. Feel free to ignore the tech-bro Xitter crowd though unless you want to watch the bonfire. </p><p>One thing I do understand is that this will have almost no effect on me. I <em>want</em> the DoJ to go after these tech companies and the billions and billions of dollars to make sure they are dotting every i and crossing every t. No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in any market and be able to leverage it to drive competition out of business. Investigate them as much as you can.</p><p>I just want it all to actually matter once the dust settles even though I know it won&apos;t.</p>
<p>It&apos;s important and it <em>does</em> matter for a lot of companies and the whole business around search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-bipartisan-bill-targeting-googles-digital-ads-business-may-arrive-this-week">online ads</a>. It should matter more and be an effective path toward changes that trickle down to consumers like you and me, but I&apos;m not going to hold my breath. If anything, the price we pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a new phone</a> will climb a few dollars.</p><p>The big tech shakeup is probably going to have the same effect on us regular folks as Microsoft&apos;s antitrust trial years ago did. Some words on some pages will change, deals will be renegotiated, and money will change hands. So much money will change hands. For us though? Imagine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-launcher-default-search-engine-picker-spotted">a new check box</a> when you first sign into an iPhone and you&apos;ve got the picture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.16%;"><img id="qdDEmgtD6aUSTTMRMy9BtT" name="google-eu-antitrust-adx-ad-exchange.jpg" alt="The European Commission's example of the buying and selling side in the ad industry." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdDEmgtD6aUSTTMRMy9BtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="353" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: European Commission)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rules always favor the players that know how to exploit them. When it comes to search and online ads, that&apos;s Google. They&apos;re the New England Patriots of internet search. Google will weather this storm through years of appeals, meanwhile shifting its strategies and ways of making money to better comply in case it doesn&apos;t get away with it in the end. </p><p>In a perfect world, the penalty phase of these tech antitrust trials would be held back and kept secret until all the guilty parties are ferreted out. then swing it down in one big blow of the hammer and shake everything and everyone up.</p><p>In the real world, Google will keep on being Google and finding ways to try and make all the money from all the things. The same goes for the rest of the big tech companies that seem to want to set their own rules and policies until they get caught.</p>
<p>One day a company will dethrone google when it comes to search and ads. It ain&apos;t today.</p>

<hr>
<p>Leaks surrounding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series are heating up ahead of a Made by Google event that&apos;s less than two weeks away. We expect to see a whopping four phones debut there, including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. They&apos;ll all presumably be powered by the Tensor G4 chip, which will be Google&apos;s next in-house mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, if recent reports are to be believed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-minimalistic-upgrade-report">Google might not be planning a massive performance increase</a> over the current Tensor G3 chip. </p><p>The news comes via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-tensor-g4-small-upgrade-3466398/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which says an unnamed source at Google revealed the Tensor G4 isn&apos;t going to be a considerable upgrade over the Tensor G3. There is a new architecture for the chipset, which uses a 4+3+1 layout with Cortex-A520 (1.9GHz), Cortex-A720 (2.6GHz), and Cortex-X4 (3.1GHz). This will reportedly lead to "slightly higher" clock speeds compared to the Tensor G3.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s much of the same for the Tensor G4. According to the report, the Mali-G715 will be used for graphics, just like the Tensor G3. Although it is said to be clocked higher this time, at 940MHz instead of 890MHz, it&apos;s unclear how much of a difference that will make in everyday usage. The biggest upgrade might come from the inclusion of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Samsung Exynos 5400</a> modem that&apos;s reported to reduce power consumption by as much as half.</p><p>Sometimes, chip progress stalls and it&apos;s just part of the ebbs and flows of processor design and fabrication. However, slow development will impact Google more than it would, say, Apple and Qualcomm. The latter two companies are at the top of their game, with the A17 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoCs both representing the best mobile processing has to offer.</p>

<p>The same can&apos;t be said for Google. The company fixed the glaring problems with the Tensor G2 platform last year, solving the overheating issues and the disastrous performance. Still, it&apos;s hard to describe the current Tensor G3 as <em>great</em>. It&apos;s passable, but performance lags behind the likes of Apple and Qualcomm even still. Another year of middling performance with the Tensor G4 wouldn&apos;t do anything to quell concerns that Pixels don&apos;t have the performance to keep up with other flagships nowadays.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are now marketed as long-term buys, with Google and Samsung touting seven years of software support across their current crop of flagship devices. And yet, if the Tensor G3 and G4 lag behind the competition today, how will these chips fare seven years from now? We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">called these OS update promises into question</a> before, but the guarantees are more concerning if the Tensor G4 isn&apos;t a notable improvement. To run Android in the 2030s, these chips will almost assuredly need more power. </p><p>So, it all comes down to this: are you willing to invest in a Pixel that isn&apos;t even performance-competitive today, especially when reports indicate that the following Tensor G5 upgrade could represent the biggest year-to-year performance upgrade we&apos;ve seen from Google? If I&apos;m considering spending my hard-earned cash, I&apos;m waiting for the Pixel 10.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tricky to understate how big of a performance leap we&apos;re expecting from the Tensor G5 platform, which could launch in 2025 with the Pixel 10 series. The Tensor G5 is said to be the first Google chip made using a fully custom design. If you recall, custom designs are what helped Qualcomm and Apple both deliver excellent performance and optimization from their chipsets. It&apos;s also rumored to be produced by TSMC, which is clearly the leader in chip fabrication at the moment, trouncing Intel and Samsung.</p><p>According to a recent report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20240629700043-430501" target="_blank">Taiwan Commercial Times</a>, Google is at the "tapeout" step in the chip design and fabrication process. This is a big moment where the company will decide whether to move forward with mass production of the Tensor G5. It&apos;s a lengthy process to make a smartphone chip, but the fact that this stage is occurring now could indicate that the TSMC-made Tensor G5 chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">will be ready for the Pixel 10 series</a>.</p><p>To date, every Tensor chip was based on a Samsung Exynos design, and is fabricated by Samsung. However, reports say that the switch to TSMC for the Tensor G5 platform will utilize the company&apos;s 3nm process node. For perspective, Apple was the first to use TSMC&apos;s 3nm process in the mobile sector with the A17 Pro, which is the leader in mobile performance. Qualcomm is actually a step behind with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform</a>, which uses the 4nm process.</p><p>All together, it looks more and more like the Pixel 10 and its Tensor G5 chip will be the one to wait for. Tensor G4 is reportedly nothing special, meanwhile the Tensor G5 made by TSMC could be groundbreaking. If you&apos;re considering investing in a Pixel, perhaps think about waiting a year to get the best value for your money. </p>

<ul><li>It seems that Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold appeared for its Camera FV-5 certification, which offered a look at its primary and front-facing camera specs.</li><li>The database suggests that the device won't offer much of an improvement as it still features a 48MP primary lens with a slightly higher 10MP front camera.</li><li>A user spotted the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in Taiwan, giving us a good look at its revamped camera array and design in a new case.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Among the rumors of the Pixel Fold successor, its supposed camera specifications have been absent — until now.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-camera-fv-5-certification/">91Mobiles</a> states that Google&apos;s upcoming foldable device appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.camerafv5.com/devices/">Camera FV-5 database</a>, spilling a few camera specifications. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.camerafv5.com/devices/manufacturers/google/pixel_9_pro_fold_comet_0/">listing</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold may arrive sporting a pixel-binned 48MP primary lens with an f/1.7 aperture.</p><p>The database suggests the camera will feature OIS (optical image stabilization) and EIS (electronic image stabilization). What&apos;s odd is that the Camera FV-5 listing doesn&apos;t expand on the rear camera array, leaving just the primary camera open for discussion.</p><p>The listing shifts to the selfie camera, stating it will arrive at 10MP alongside EIS. That camera will supposedly reach a f/2.2 aperture with a larger 77.8-degree FOV over the rumored primary camera&apos;s 55.8-degree gaze.</p><p>Interestingly, the camera specifications we can dissect don&apos;t appear wildly different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. The original model offers a 48MP with f/1.7 aperture similar to what&apos;s been discovered for the 9 Pro Fold. The internal display offers an 8MP selfie lens while the cover display features a 9.5MP. It remains to be seen which "front" camera the listing is referring to; but either way, it&apos;s a minimal upgrade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i" name="Pixel-9-Pro-Fold.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgwCNBLT2zkiKn6VrnzE9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Made by Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the rest of the rear array&apos;s absence, the publication adds that the 9 Pro Fold is rumored to feature a 10.5MP ultrawide lens and a 10.8MP telephoto. These are numbers incredibly close to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2#section-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cameras">the original model already provides</a>, so it seems Google isn&apos;t prioritizing the foldable&apos;s camera this year.</p><p>Regardless, the company recently confirmed the existence of a Pixel Fold successor after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">releasing a quick teaser</a>. Google gave us a look at the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in a champagne gold/cream colorway. The standout of the teaser was confirmation of its redesigned camera array, as the device drops the classic Pixel visor for a square array.</p><p>Earlier today (August 5), a photo of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/check-out-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-flaunting-its-official-case-in-the-wild">9 Pro Fold in the wild</a> surfaced, showing the device in a new Google case. It seems the device was sporting an Obsidian colorway within the Porcelain colored case, featuring the typical Google "G" in the center. The case offers a sleek, streamlined cutout for the new squared camera array at the top left of the device&apos;s back panel.</p><p>More importantly, the live photo doesn&apos;t suggest that the Fold&apos;s camera bump will be too awkward — which might help consumers breathe easily. Nevertheless, Google is preparing to host an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event on August 13</a> where we&apos;ll learn all about the 9 Pro Fold in full detail.</p>

<ul><li>A discovery in Android 15 Beta 4 showed that Google plans to bring a "compact" version of the software's notifications to users.</li><li>The "compact" layout displays an app's logo, a single line of text, and a quick "REPLY" button, leaving the rest in its dropdown expansion menu.</li><li>Android 15 Beta 4 launched in mid-July and marches Google toward a (hopeful) August release if testing goes swimmingly.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems Google plans to rework the pop-up notifications that appear when using your device or watching videos.</p><p>The discovery was made by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-compact-heads-up-notifications-3468061/">Android Authority</a>) when searching through the depths of Android 15 Beta 4. To make them intrusive and disruptive, Rahman found mention of a "compact" notification layout. Getting it to work showed Google plans to have notifications displayed smaller and as a single line of text, accompanied by the app&apos;s logo.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> still plans to give users a quick and easy way to reply instantly. The upcoming compact form factor features a "REPLY" option beside an arrow, indicating an expansion of the notification.</p><p>It seems that tapping the arrow will open the notification to what users are currently used to seeing on Android. In doing so, users will find an extensive look at the received message alongside a small snapshot of any included photos. The "mark as read" option should be visible after expanding the compact view, as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1302px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.08%;"><img id="Zm6ZY7HLAGmwJFafjtudoA" name="google-android-15-compact-notification-layout.jpg" alt="An early look at Google's planned "compact" notification layout for notifications." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zm6ZY7HLAGmwJFafjtudoA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1302" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s some uncertainty regarding Google&apos;s intended debut of this "compact" notification variant. Rahman suggests it may not roll out during Android 15&apos;s official debut, considering the option isn&apos;t readily available for beta testers in Beta 4. Moreover, he states there&apos;s no option to set your notifications to abide by the compact view or the regular expanded version.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-4-is-here-as-the-stable-release-gets-closer">Android 15 Beta 4</a> started arriving for enrolled Pixel testers in the middle of July. The update marked quite a significant step for the next major OS release as Google marches toward a stable launch. Users downloaded a patch rife with productivity, security, and privacy improvements.</p><p>Among them was the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> feature, which helps users hide and secure sensitive information like photos, emails, and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-spaces-revamp-features-added">with various tools</a>. Early findings show that Google will inform users that their Private Space <em>cannot </em>be transferred to another device due to the nature of creation.</p><p>As developers put the final touches on their apps ahead of Android 15, its launch date isn&apos;t set in stone. If all goes well, it&apos;s speculated that Google could begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">rolling it out in August</a> to coincide with the Pixel 9 reveal. The upcoming series is expected to arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-satellite-sos-consumer-charge-potential">with satellite connectivity</a>, but it might cost you if you really like it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has been embroiled in a case over its power in online search and advertising.</li><li>On Monday, a judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain its search monopoly by securing itself as a default on devices.</li><li>Google has a separate trial over its advertising technology set for later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A major blow was struck against Google on Monday after a judge ruled that the company illegally maintained a monopoly in search, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html">The New York Times</a>. The ruling comes years after the Justice Department and U.S. states sued Google over its search dominance back in 2020. The ruling could have far-reaching consequences for Alphabet and Big Tech.</p><p>Judge Amit P. Mehta made the ruling after closing arguments were made in May. He acknowledges in the ruling that Google has hired skilled employees and continues to innovate its product while making "shrewd business decisions" to maintain its market dominance.</p><p>However, the problem lies in how Google has positioned itself as the default search engine across various products. Judge Mehta has determined that Google has violated section 2 of the Sherman Act, which promotes competition and prohibits "monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to monopolize."</p><p>"For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts," Judge Mehta states in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896">289-page ruling</a> obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">The Verge</a>. It explains how this is achieved through advertising revenue share, which it pays to companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/doj-sues-google-for-anti-competitive-practices">in exchange for making Google Search the default</a> on products like Safari.</p><p>"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only received placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google."</p><p>Because users generally stick to the default search engine on their devices, this is seen as extremely valuable real estate, forcing competitors to find other avenues to get consumers to use their search engines. To put into perspective, Google had nearly 95% of search market share on mobile phones by 2020, with Microsoft&apos;s Bing making up the rest.</p><p>The ruling goes on to note how Google has become synonymous with search, going largely unchallenged by the competition.</p><p>Yet, there was some reprieve. While the court found Google held a monopoly in search and text advertising, it was also determined that Google does not hold monopoly power in general search advertising and that there is no market for search advertising. The court also declined to sanction Google for not preserving employee chat messages.</p><p>"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn&apos;t be allowed to make it easily available," says Kent Walker, Google&apos;s president of Global Affairs, in response to the ruling.</p><p>"We appreciate the Court&apos;s finding that Google is &apos;the industry&apos;s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,&apos; that Google &apos;has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,&apos; &apos;has continued to innovate in search&apos; and that &apos;Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google&apos;s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google&apos;s to be superior.&apos;</p><p>Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use."</p><p>However, Google&apos;s woes are just beginning. The company still faces a separate trial later this year over its advertising technology.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims that Samsung plans on bringing a few Galaxy AI features to the Galaxy A35 and the Galaxy A55 midrange phones.</li><li>This will reportedly occur during the rollout of One UI 6.1.1, but the AI's arrival will not include "everything."</li><li>One UI 6.1.1 is still under development and has supposedly further delayed the start of Samsung's One UI 7 (Android 15) beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amid Samsung&apos;s rapid push for its AI software, rumors swirl about its next potential expansion to another range of phones.</p><p>A few unnamed sources have reportedly informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ai-select-2024-galaxy-a-phones/">SamMobile</a> that Samsung will bring Galaxy AI to its Galaxy A series. Although the information given was limited, there&apos;s a chance the company will roll out its AI software on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A35 and the Galaxy A55</a> mid-range phones. The publication could "confirm" as much, though it&apos;s stated that there&apos;s no chance of it coming to any older A-series devices.</p><p>It was then rumored that "not every" Galaxy AI feature would be featured on the A35 and the A55. This is likely due to the lack of some internal hardware components as Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI heavily relies on the NPU and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a>. A more concrete answer to which features we could see was left unanswered.</p><p>With the hardware limitations in mind, it would come as little surprise if the Galaxy A35 and A55 received Galaxy AI features that rely on the cloud. This means that we could see the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">Generative Wallpaper</a>, and others. </p><p>This move isn&apos;t entirely unprecedented, as the Galaxy S24 series&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-galaxy-ai-pure-magic">Instant Slow-Mo</a> feature was mentioned as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">S23 FE</a> lacks it. That trend may continue with the A series devices as that feature may require a processing power they don&apos;t have.</p><p>When it could land is reportedly up to Samsung&apos;s planned release of the One UI 6.1.1 update. The post claims that this could take place "this month or the next."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Samsung rolled out its One UI 6.1 update to a few devices, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-midranges-may-rumor">couple of A series phones</a>. The patch notably lacked any Galaxy AI upgrades for the devices and their hardware capabilities were the culprit. However, with the latest round of rumors, it seems that Samsung has found a way to implement Galaxy AI into its mid-range devices to some capacity.</p><p>The Galaxy S22 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">went through a similar issue</a> and the Korean brand found a way to patch in <em>some </em>AI features despite the limited hardware.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh, discussed the company&apos;s newfound <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">R&D focus on AI</a> following Unpacked. In the future, Roh stated that AI will become "multi-modal" and that the "AI Phone" will become Samsung&apos;s main business since the introduction of the Galaxy S24. Additionally, this new era will require the company to invest in new hardware to meet the software&apos;s requirements.</p><p>We&apos;re still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">waiting on One UI 6.1.1</a>, which seems to have delayed the originally planned start of the One UI 7 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) beta. So, those with a Galaxy A35 or Galaxy A55 will have to wait a little longer to see if these rumors pan out.</p>

<p>After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">OnePlus Pad</a> was released with stylus support, complete with the OnePlus Stylo, it would have come as a bit of a shock to see a new tablet arrive without it. Thankfully, that&apos;s not something we need to worry about as the OnePlus Pad 2 features stylus support.</p><p>In addition to the OnePlus Pad 2 and Smart Keyboard, the Stylo 2 was also introduced. Currently, this is the only stylus that works with OnePlus&apos; latest tablet. We tried using an array of USI stylus options, such as those that work with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/best-stylus-pixel-tablet">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, but none of those worked with the Pad 2.</p><p>There was a bit of hope that this might not be the case after noticing that the "eraser" on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/penoval-usi-2-pen">Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus</a> was able to interact with the display. However, it was extremely inconsistent and isn&apos;t something that we recommend trying to use.</p><p>Nevertheless, the OnePlus Stylo 2 was released alongside the Pad 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/product/product/oneplus-stylo-2">retailing for $99</a>, and is available directly from the company. The Stylo 2, too has been slightly redesigned, as it ditches the matte white finish from its predecessor in favor of a leather-like texture for improved grip.</p>

<p>Other features of the Stylo 2 include 16,000 levels of pressure, while OnePlus claims it offers "near-instant response." When used with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-just-launched-but-it-might-be-the-best-prime-day-tablet-deal">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, the Stylo 2 also provides "subtle feedback" by interacting with the display using the stylus. This also applies when jotting down notes, attempting to replicate the feeling when writing with pen and paper.</p><p>Pushing the boundaries even further, the Stylo 2 can double as a laser pointer for presentations. All you&apos;ll need to do is press and hold on to the built-in touchpad, and the Stylo 2 will spring into action, removing any headaches that might&apos;ve occurred if you didn&apos;t have the Pad 2 and Stylo 2. Plus, the aforementioned touchpad can even be used to scroll through documents without needing to touch the screen or the Smart Keyboard&apos;s trackpad.</p><p>Additionally, those worried about the potential of losing the Stylo 2 can rest easy. Thanks to the series of magnets built into both the tablet and stylus, just place the Stylo 2 along the top and it will snap into place. This is how you pair the two devices together, and while the Stylo 2 is attached, it will also be wirelessly charged until you remove it or the battery is full.</p><p>Although we wish the OnePlus Pad 2 featured USI 2.0 support, at least the Stylo 2 is here to prevent any additional frustrations.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 could end up offering the best value of the year, as it's the first Android tablet to launch with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and is priced less than the Galaxy Tab S9. Plus, you can pair it with the OnePlus Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard for the ultimate portable workstation.</p></p>

It&apos;ll only take you a minute, assuming you have a Galaxy phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> has no built-in GPS or UWB. The Galaxy Wearable app will save the last <em>known</em> location based on your phone&apos;s GPS data, but if you leave your Galaxy Ring in a public bathroom and someone takes it, you&apos;ll have no way of finding it.</p><p>Worse, if you connect your Galaxy Ring to a non-Samsung phone, you have no way of tracking it, because the system uses the Samsung Find app only available through the Galaxy Store. All you can do is light up the ring&apos;s LEDs to make it more visible, which won&apos;t help if the tiny wearable falls into a couch cushion.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring reviewer</a> has middling impressions of it thus far, and his inability to track it with a non-Samsung phone is a big knock against it. Still, for Samsung phone owners, here&apos;s how to find your lost Galaxy Ring!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring-2">How to find your lost Samsung Galaxy Ring</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As mentioned above, most of the steps below only work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>. </p><p>1. On your Galaxy phone, open <strong>Settings > Security and privacy > Lost device protection</strong>. </p><p>2. Toggle <strong>Offline finding</strong> and hit <strong>Turn on</strong> on the subsequent pop-up screen.</p><p>3. Open the <strong>Galaxy Wearable app</strong>. If you have multiple devices connected — like the Galaxy Ring and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> — and the Galaxy Ring isn&apos;t immediately visible, tap the <strong>devices button</strong> (a hovering circle with two squares and circles) and switch to it.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Find My Ring</strong> at the bottom of the app menu.</p><p>5. Samsung will tell you to <strong>enable location permissions</strong>. Be sure to enable these to <strong>allow devices to be found</strong>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXKx6YkTg2wbAgkh9bppea" name="how-to-find-lost-samsung-galaxy-ring-screenshots.jpg" alt="Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Find screenshots showing how the Lost Ring feature works for the Galaxy Ring." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXKx6YkTg2wbAgkh9bppea.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, Samsung will track the Galaxy Ring&apos;s location by default in the <strong>Samsung Find app</strong>, which Samsung uses instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Google&apos;s Find My network</a>. </p><p>With a Samsung phone, you open Samsung Find and tap your ring under <strong>Devices</strong>. A Galaxy Ring icon will appear wherever it was last detected, whether online or offline.</p><p>You&apos;ll see the <strong>Blink light</strong> option, as well as a <strong>Refresh</strong> button to update its last known location. Under <strong>More</strong>, you can toggle <strong>Notify me when it&apos;s found</strong> or <strong>Notify when left behind</strong>. The latter is especially useful for warning you immediately if your phone detects it disconnecting.</p><p>With a non-Samsung phone, your process is simpler (and less useful). Open the Galaxy Wearable app and tap Find My Ring. You&apos;ll find a threadbare menu with only one option: <strong>Tap Start</strong> to make the Galaxy Ring LEDs blink.</p>
<h2 id="finding-your-galaxy-ring-shouldn-apos-t-be-a-samsung-exclusive-2">Finding your Galaxy Ring shouldn&apos;t be a Samsung exclusive</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C36SKfEDC3XzvmGDA4crLM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-02.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring showing battery percentage on the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C36SKfEDC3XzvmGDA4crLM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s a common trend for Samsung to make vital tools exclusive to push you to buy all of their devices, like making life-saving AFib detection on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> restricted to the Health Monitor app.</p><p>In this case, Samsung made a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-samsung-galaxy-ring-features-are-exclusive-to-samsung-phones">Galaxy Ring features exclusive to Samsung phones</a>, including the Energy Score, Wellness Tips, and gesture controls. But making the Find My Ring feature Galaxy exclusive, with no alternative option like Google&apos;s network, is borderline inexcusable for a device this small and expensive.</p><p>Our Galaxy Ring tester tried connecting it to Google&apos;s Find My Network, but it wasn&apos;t visible. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/rings/galaxy-ring/" target="_blank">official Samsung Galaxy Ring page</a> claims that the lost ring feature "requires a smartphone with the SmartThings app," but he couldn&apos;t make the Galaxy Ring appear there, either. He even tried a third-party Bluetooth finder app to see if he could use it to hunt it down locally; again, it wasn&apos;t visible in the devices list. </p><p>We&apos;ve emailed Samsung to ask whether they have any plans to add lost-ring tracking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> besides Samsung&apos;s own. They responded that "Android phone users will see blinking lights when prompted to locate their ring," and didn&apos;t provide further details. As it is, it&apos;s extremely easy to lose track of a smart ring unless it&apos;s left in plain sight, and you should be careful whenever you take it off to note where you&apos;ve left it.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring lasts up to a week per charge, 10ATM and IP68 protection via the titanium frame, an ultra-lightweight design, and a complimentary charging cradle for on-the-go charging. It tracks a bunch of heart rate and sleep data passively, while being much more comfortable than a smartwatch.</p></p>
