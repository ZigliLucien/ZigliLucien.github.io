                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Nothing Phone (2a) is turning out to be one of the best options if you want a budget phone in 2024. The phone has the same bold styling as the Phone (1) and Phone (2), and it even includes LED lighting at the back that&apos;s mated to the Glyph interface. Having used the phone for just under a week now, it&apos;s clear that Nothing wanted to deliver a similar level of experience as its costlier phones, but in the budget segment.</p><p>There&apos;s just one problem: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone (2a)</a> isn&apos;t launching in the U.S. Nothing made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone (2)</a> available to purchase via its U.S. website last year, but the Phone (2a) is being sold in limited quantities in the region, and you have to sign up as a developer to be eligible to pick up the device. Even then, there&apos;s no official warranty.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-co-founder-akis-evangelidis-phone-2a-interview">asked Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis</a> the reason for not launching the Phone (2a) Stateside, and he said that it isn&apos;t the "right time to go all-in" in the U.S. just yet. "We&apos;re still just a three-year-old brand, so we have to be strategic about our efforts. While we need to maintain a level of presence in the U.S., it isn&apos;t the right time to go all-in just yet considering the size of the market."</p><p>As for the limited presence, Nothing sells its audio products in the U.S., and Evangelidis confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear (2)</a> sold really well in the region. But when it comes to the phone segment, there&apos;s a similar refrain that I&apos;ve heard from just about every phone manufacturer that doesn&apos;t have a major presence in the country: dealing with carriers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most global markets, Nothing can&apos;t just sell the phone via its website and hope to make any sort of dent in the budget segment. Carriers control the U.S. smartphone industry, and Evangelidis noted that the brand isn&apos;t "in a rush," and that it is looking to secure the right carrier partnership before making a full-fledged debut in the country. "The unlocked market is quite limited, so there&apos;s only so much you can do as a standalone brand. We need to find the right partner that understands our strategy and believes in the brand. You can only enter the market once, and we want to get that right — we&apos;re not in a rush."</p><p>Regarding the Phone (2), which was available unlocked on Nothing&apos;s website, Evangelidis said that as the device was aimed at early adopters, it was a straightforward decision to sell it directly. But the Phone (2a) is intended as a mass-market device, and without a carrier partnership, it didn&apos;t make sense for the brand to launch it in the country.</p><p>There&apos;s good reason for Evangelidis to be wary when it comes to partnering with a U.S. carrier. Evangelidis and Carl Pei were at OnePlus when the Chinese manufacturer teamed up with T-Mobile to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6t-review">OnePlus 6T</a> in the country, and what was lauded as a major win for the company turned sour as T-Mobile&apos;s requirements didn&apos;t line up with OnePlus&apos;s strategy at the time.</p><p>The way I understood it, T-Mobile wanted phones to be available for at least 12 months after month, and OnePlus would only sell its devices for six months — this was during the T series refresh. The result was that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-review">OnePlus 7T</a> was available on T-Mobile well after stock ran out just about everywhere else in the world, and these days, OnePlus only sells its entry-level Nord N series with the carrier, with its flagships like the OnePlus 12 sold unlocked on its website and Amazon.</p><p>As for Nothing, Evangelidis said the brand would take its time choosing a carrier partner before selling its phones in the region. He talked about how the partnership works in other regions, hailing India&apos;s Flipkart as the "benchmark" in this regard. Ultimately, the Phone (2a) is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phones of 2024</a>, but U.S. users miss out on the device — like dozens of other phones — because of the unique carrier-dominated ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xiaomi may be gearing up to disrupt the foldable smartphone market with its upcoming flagship, the MIX Fold 4.</li><li>A new rumor points to significant upgrades in build quality, particularly a sturdier body and hinge design, which could minimize creasing on the folding screen.</li><li>The MIX Fold 4 is expected to offer top-notch performance with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, along with a massive 16GB RAM and 1TB storage.</li></ul>

<p>Xiaomi is preparing to shake things up in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable smartphone race</a> with its upcoming flagship, the MIX Fold 4. While it might still be a while before it hits store shelves, some juicy details about what to expect from the device are starting to surface.</p><p>According to a scoop shared by Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/O4FnHhgwX?pagetype=groupfeed" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, the Xiaomi MIX Fold 4 might be a huge upgrade with a sturdier body and hinge (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-leaked-specs_id156192" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>). The tipster says this new hinge will mean less creasing on the folding screen.</p><p>Under the hood, the MIX Fold 4 could be rocking Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, which makes sense since it&apos;s going to be another flagship from Xiaomi. Plus, rumor has it that the foldable phone will pack a whopping 16GB of RAM and a massive 1TB of storage.</p><p>The battery on board is rumored to be 5000mAh, with support for 100W charging. To put things in perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-mix-fold-3-launch">MIX Fold 3</a> had a 4800mAh battery with 67W charging.</p><p>According to DCS, the phone might sport a 50MP main camera with a fixed, wide aperture. There&apos;s also talk about a new periscope camera that could potentially replace its predecessor&apos;s 5x 10MP sensor with a higher-resolution shooter, promising better long-range zoom capabilities.</p><p>Xiaomi may also have new tricks up its sleeve. As per the tipster, the upcoming foldable phone could come equipped with two-way satellite communications and even water resistance. If that turns out to be true, it looks like Samsung might have some serious competition to deal with.</p><p>However, Xiaomi might decide to reserve some of these features exclusively for the domestic market.</p><p>The Xiaomi MIX Fold series has traditionally been limited to the Chinese market, but according to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gsmchina.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-4-will-be-the-first-global-mix-fold-device-ever-4628/" target="_blank">leak</a>, the MIX Fold 4 might just break that trend and see a global release.</p><p>The foldable phone race continues to become more intense than we expected, with companies rolling out some seriously impressive models, and Xiaomi seems poised to raise the bar even further.</p>

It also came a couple of weeks after Samsung rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/first-major-galaxy-s24-patch">very first update</a> for the S24, which was to offer relief for users unhappy with the Vivid display changes.</p><p>The most notable part of this March patch for the S23 is its lack of Galaxy AI features.  The Korean OEM plans to bring a few of its latest on-device and cloud-based AI tools to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-coming-to-older-galaxy-phones">past-gen devices</a>. The Galaxy S23 series is among those eligible, however, we haven&apos;t gotten that yet.</p><p>It looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-one-ui-61-update-and-ai-features-incoming">we aren&apos;t far from it</a>, as it&apos;s expected that the S24&apos;s Galaxy AI features should arrive via a One UI 6.1 patch later in March.</p>

<ul><li>During Google's Game Developer Summit, the company detailed new additions arriving for users on the Play Store.</li><li>Users will begin noticing YouTube videos on the Play Store today about its most popular games, alongside some more game content visibility.</li><li>Google Play Games is adding more native PC gaming support for additional titles and more in-game rewards for Play Pass subscribers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Game Developer Summit started today, and the company is highlighting a few new updates for Android gaming that are arriving today.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-for-games-developer-summit-2024/">Keyword</a> post, the Play Store is rolling out "new ways to engage" with your mobile games. The company states users should begin noticing YouTube videos about some of the Play Store&apos;s most popular games in the "Games" tab. Additionally, these videos will appear on listing pages.</p><p>Google stated in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html">Android Developers</a> blog post that store listings will now "more prominently" display game updates, new content, and ongoing gaming promotions. However, these changes will not affect everyone, as Google states that they will apply to English-language users and "select titles" in its program.</p><p>Developers are also gaining new tools for in-game ads, as the company states users may find them seamlessly integrated with the game they&apos;re playing. This applies to pop-up ads and video ad breaks, as mobile gaming developers can now run the ad without removing the player from their experience.</p><p>Alongside these Play Store updates, users should begin noticing Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-ai-generated-faqs-features-leak">AI-generated FAQ section</a> appearing on an app&apos;s details page.</p>

<p>PC enjoyers are receiving additional Google Play Games support for native desktop gaming. Users will soon have access to a more expansive library of supported mobile games on PC. Google states Solo Leveling: Aris is preparing to join the likes of Genshin Impact, Odin: Valhalla, and Lineage2M through its Play Games desktop launcher.</p><p>Play Pass subscribers are in for a treat. Starting today (Mar.12), they are receiving extra bonuses for in-game goodies. The post states that these extra in-game items and discounts are on their way for EA SPORTS FC Mobile, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, MONOPOLY GO!, and Roblox.</p><p>Google&apos;s Play Pass has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/03/key-product-updates-from-2024-google-for-games-developer-summit.html#:~:text=Expanded%20programs%20to%20accelerate%20growth">reportedly grown by 120%</a> in the past year. The company states it will roll out the subscription service&apos;s in-game rewards in 21 markets in 2024, including Japan. Additionally, it will bring Play Pass to South Korea "later this year."</p><p>The company has turned to its loyalty rewards program, "Play Points," stating that it has achieved over 220 million members and will soon launch in Brazil.</p><p>Lastly, Google is giving developers additional tools to give users more sign-in options for Play Games services. The company doesn&apos;t expand on what these extra options could look like; however, it states that your earned achievements and game progress will follow you no matter the method you prefer.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit has launched the "Walk Mate" program, which will last two months as the company is eager to learn how to better encourage users to "stay active."</li><li>Users will be given personalized notifications daily to help them plan their daily walks.</li><li>Fitbit and Google recently participated in a study to help understand how to facilitate better metabolic health in users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fitbit has been spotted starting a new study that brings "personalized" notifications to users daily.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/11/fitbit-walkmate/">9to5Google</a>, "Walk Mate" is a two-month study the company is kickstarting to encourage users to walk more and "stay active." Fitbit lets users join the program with the app&apos;s "Step" card, which then offers a survey. Users with an average of 8,000 steps per day or less will see this appear in their Steps card.</p><p>The company appears curious about "what general situations might affect your physical activity." Users will find questions asking if they are beneath the average steps per day threshold if they&apos;ve been advised against exercising by a doctor, and if they are in the U.S.</p><p>Some additional program details state users enrolled in the Walkmate program will receive one notification daily to "reflect on so you can plan your walk for the day." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-fitbit-premium">Fitbit</a> has also opened the floodgates for user feedback moving forward. Additionally, users will find a "Walk Mate" card on the Fitbit app&apos;s home screen (the Today tab).</p><p>The publication adds these personalized notifications through Walk Mate will appear in the same fashion as Fitibit&apos;s hourly reminders to get moving.</p><p>Considering Google Health and Studies is behind this program, the company will take in your data to see different "get active" strategies folks prefer, how long users stick with such strategies, and more.</p>

<p>Fitbit&apos;s shift to help understand how to get people walking comes two months after it began a study on users&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-fitbit-wear-me-study">metabolic health</a>. Google was eager to understand what factors contribute to good metabolic health, as it was discovered that only 12% of adults in America fit that category. Fitbit wearables and Google&apos;s Pixel Watch are outfitted with sensors to help capture data about a user&apos;s metabolism.</p><p>However, Google wanted to go deeper, requiring users to submit a blood sample to measure cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.</p><p>Fitbit submitted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-patent-shows-plans-to-monitor-mental-health">discovery of a patent</a> regarding a device that could monitor a user&apos;s mental health back in January. The patent was originally filed in 2021 but recently received approval in January 2024. Such a device is said to use machine learning to assess if the wearer has a mental disorder, like depression.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing Phone 2a receives its first update after its launch on March 5.</li><li>The update introduces new widgets, cameras, and performance improvements to the company's first budget phone.</li><li>There are system-wide stability improvements and also the addition of new ringtones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing just unveiled the Phone 2a early this month, and the company is already rolling out its first update to the device, bringing several performance and camera improvements.</p><p>The latest release is dubbed Nothing OS 2.5.3 and is rolling out to the Phone 2a, which is bringing three new widgets to the home screen: camera, recorders, and battery. The camera improvements with the firmware release include support for Ultra XDR, multiple enhancements for HDR, color saturation, and the selfie camera. The respective native camera app will also see some enhancements.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the performance improvements include enhancements to background app performance; the touchscreen experience will also see some improvements. Haptic feedback has new nifty adjustments with the addition of new levels. Nothing says users should also experience overall refinements across the user interface and animations in the Nothing OS 2.5.3.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/6368-nothing-os-253-rolling-out-for-phone-2a">full changelog</a> further showcases the bug fixes with the latest release, which includes the reset issue on the Pedometer widget, which apparently was reset after a change in time zones. In certain scenarios, app icons seem to have been missing while unlocking the screen, which is fixed with the latest release. </p><p>Similarly, an occasional black screen issue on the lock screen interface and fingerprint unlock issue (while the screen is off) is also addressed.</p>

<ul><li>Mishaal Rahman spotted a new feature, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 1, that could be a Pixel 9 exclusive.</li><li>The "Adaptive Touch" feature, which adjusts the screen's touch sensitivity based on environmental conditions, has been spotted.</li><li>The feature will likely be an exclusive for Pixel phones set to release this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9 is the highly anticipated series launch from Google, which is months away. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-render-leak">leaks</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-renders-leak">renders</a> keep us glued to what to expect, and one such information comes from Mishaal Rahman.</p><p>To tackle touch sensitivity issues more effectively, Google might finally introduce its "Adaptive Touch" feature on the Pixel 9 series, notes Rahman (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-9-adaptive-touch-3424475/">Android Authority</a>). The relevant evidence was found in the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-1-is-here">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 1</a>, where we are likely to see a new "Adaptive Touch" setting. It will be buried under <strong>Settings> Display> Touch Sensitivity</strong> — where we usually see the "Screen Protector mode "on Pixel devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QQSCgce2H2FkvYLcyQ3YG5" name="google-pixel-8-pro-display-settings.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8 Pro's display settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QQSCgce2H2FkvYLcyQ3YG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman notes that he had dug into the code to spot the "Adaptive Touch," which, when enabled, "will automatically adjust to your environment activities and screen protector." The factors here still need to be determined, but having wet fingers, having a damp screen, or highly harsh hot/cold conditions could be a possibility. </p><p>If it sounds familiar, the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> has a similar Aqua Touch feature that allows you to use it effortlessly, even in rainy situations.</p><p>Users often protect their precious screens with screen protectors, which could also be an issue. While the current screen protector mode helps with screen touch, the "Adaptive Touch" is said to automatically adjust the touch sensitivity without the need to enable it manually, like in the current scenario.</p><p>Rahman indicates the code further suggests that the "Adaptive Touch" will likely come to this year&apos;s Pixel devices first, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2-renders">Pixel Fold 2</a>. We can expect it to venture to Pixel 9 as an exclusive. Like previous exclusive features, the "Adaptive Touch" feature might eventually trickle down to older Pixel handsets. </p>

<ul><li>Motorola has announced two new phones - the Moto G 5G and the Moto G Power 5G.</li><li>The Moto G is set to cost $199, while the Moto G Power costs $299.</li><li>Both devices will be on sale later this month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has unveiled two new handsets that look like they could force their way into the conversation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> of 2024. The Moto G 5G 2024 and the Moto G Power 5G 2024 both offer pretty impressive specs at very affordable prices. Both devices run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box and offer improved displays, cameras, and processors compared with their predecessors.</p><p>Of the two devices, the Moto G Power 2024 is the slightly more expensive model, with a price tag of $299. For that, you’ll get a 6.7-inch FHD+ LCD display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. That screen is supported by a 5,000mAh battery that supports 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, which is fairly impressive for any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">Android phone under $300</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="My6tBMbzBoY659LaAEKr8L" name="Moto-G-Power-2024.jpg" alt="Rear view of Moto G Power in Pale Lilac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/My6tBMbzBoY659LaAEKr8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7020 processor, which features a 2.2 GHz octa-core CPU. You also get 8GB of RAM that is expandable to 16GB using Motorola’s RAM Boost feature, which borrows from the phone’s 128GB internal storage to provide additional virtual memory. It also supports a microSD expansion of up to 1TB if you need more storage for your photos and everything else.</p><p>There are two rear cameras on the G Power 5G 2024 — a 50MP main camera with optical image stabilization and an 8MP ultrawide lens with a 118-degree angle and macro support. On the front is a 16MP selfie camera. Video capture is available in 60 or 30fps on the main rear camera, and 30fps on the wide-angle lens, but limited to FHD.</p>

<p>The Moto G 5G 2024 is slightly smaller and offers a 6.6-inch HD LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It also uses a 5,000mAh battery and supports 18W charging but no wireless charging capability. It is also cheaper at $199, a big drop in price compared to last year’s model, which cost $249.</p><p>Rather than the Dimensity chip of the G Power, the new Moto G uses a Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chip with a 2GHz octa-core CPU. The handset has 4GB of RAM, that can also use RAM Boost to double that to 8GB. As with its bigger sibling, the phone comes with 128GB of internal storage, with support for up to a 1TB microSD card.</p><p>The cameras are also slightly weaker than on the Moto G Power. The main camera is still 50MP, but the secondary rear camera is a 2MP macro unit with no ultrawide angle. The selfie camera is 8MP.</p><p>Motorola does claim that “better light sensitivity” will result in better photos no matter the time of day.  </p>

<p>Both devices are described as “water-repellant,” but this isn’t quite the same as having an official IP rating for water resistance, so you&apos;ll wanna be careful near water. They each come with an audio jack for wired headphones and Dolby Atmos support when you’re using the phone’s speakers. And unlike last year’s models, both offer NFC, which enables access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060043?hl=en-GB">Google Wallet</a> for contactless payments, for example. </p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 will be available in the US at Cricket from March 22 before becoming available from other carriers at a later (unspecified) date. If you want an unlocked version, you can pick one up from Amazon, Best Buy, or Motorola.com from March 29. You’ll be able to choose from Midnight Blue or Pale Lilac options.</p><p>The Moto G 5G 2024 will be available from March 21 at Metro and T-Mobile (again, other carriers will start offering this phone later). Unlocked handsets will become available at Motorola.com, Amazon, and Best Buy from May 2. You can buy the phone in any color you like, as long as it’s Sage Green.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My first smartwatch was the original Samsung Galaxy Gear. I have fond memories of feeling like I was Dick Tracy, capturing Instagram photos from my wrist, or even taking a call while I was driving. It felt like the future had just wrapped itself around my wrist in every way but one: the square design.</p><p>Fast forward to just a few months later and Motorola blew everyone&apos;s minds with the Moto 360, a <em>round</em> smartwatch that looked like a <strong>real watch</strong> and, yet, still packed in smart features. Instead of the stop-gap square watch — which looked like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">phone strapped to my wrist</a> — Motorola delivered what felt like the actual future in such a short amount of time.</p><p>Now, after a decade of using the beautiful round form factor, rumor says that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">Samsung wants to go back to square one</a>, and that&apos;s the biggest mistake the company could ever make with its smartwatch brand.</p>
<h2 id="rectangles-aren-apos-t-for-your-wrist-2">Rectangles aren&apos;t for your wrist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9QSzDsikrSZhbkh6KrFgbg" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-versus-apple-watch-ultra-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Pro (left) and Apple Watch Ultra (right) side-by-side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9QSzDsikrSZhbkh6KrFgbg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The first Galaxy Gear — and the rest of the Android Wear lineup — were all square because they had to be. No company had yet mass-manufactured a round display yet, so putting a square on your wrist was a stop-gap measure until someone did.</p><p>However, when the original Apple Watch launched, the response from the Apple fanboy press was all too predictable. While Android watches were already on their way to moving to a circular design en masse, Apple&apos;s new square was suddenly "beautiful and elegant," mainly because it curved the glass around the edges.</p><p>But it still had one big design flaw: it was square, and that made it look like a computer on your wrist, not a watch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Square watches look like computers on your wrist, not watches.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all of the good-looking watch faces were round, fitting awkwardly on the watch&apos;s square display. Some will say this is an advantage because you can put complications in each corner — the term for small widgets that let you quickly access information like heart rate or the weather — but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> over the years have proven that those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">fit just fine</a> in a circular watch face, too.</p><p>Many have pointed out that most of the information presented on a smartwatch comes in the form of squares — messages and keyboards, mainly — but, again, circular smartwatches have proven over the years that this isn&apos;t an issue and have designed around this potential pitfall in clever ways.</p><p>In fact, none other than Samsung came up with <em>the</em><strong> </strong>most brilliant way to navigate on a circular smartwatch: the rotating bezel. Samsung&apos;s entire UI was designed around using this bezel, and it felt as natural to navigate with as the touch wheel did on the original iPod.</p>

<p>But, for some strange reason, Samsung seems to like getting rid of the things people enjoy most about their smartwatches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> introduced the first mainline model without this rotating bezel, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> did away with it completely.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise that Samsung brought it back with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> after much backlash from fans, but only on the larger classic model. Now, with the company apparently "enthusiastically" considering a square watch, I wonder why the company would want to relive history and anger its fans all over again.</p><p>Samsung users don&apos;t want to look or feel like Apple users, and I highly doubt most Samsung fans would be happy with an all-square Galaxy Watch future.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung took heat for killing the rotating bezel, and now it wants to anger its fans all over again.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The shape of what&apos;s on your wrist is, obviously, a personal choice. Watches and the myriad of different styles available are all designed to help uniquely represent you and your personality. The problem is that smartwatch manufacturers haven&apos;t historically offered much in the way of different design choices.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> are almost all circular, a design choice that&apos;s as much about providing something "real" or "futuristic" as it is to look exactly the opposite of the only shape Apple provides its users. A scant few fitness-focused watches from Fitbit, Amazfit, and some other smaller brands are square, but Android customers have spoken loud and clear: round is right.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Apple Watch isn't good because of its form, it's good because of its function.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If Samsung wants to add a square smartwatch to its lineup — perhaps a Galaxy Watch 8 Square Edition or something equally terribly named — that would be just fine. But for Samsung to consider going back to a square watch when it abandoned that stopgap measure is madness.</p><p>If the company is serious about listening to its users and not repeating mistakes of the past, it&apos;ll offer more than just one design. Round and square would be great and would offer users a real choice.</p><p>To completely abandon a design trait that has made its products the most popular Android smartwatches for a decade is a foolish mistake that Samsung simply shouldn&apos;t make.</p><p>The Apple Watch isn&apos;t good because of its shape; it&apos;s good because of its function. If Samsung wants to blindly copy Apple for any reason, it should start there.</p>
