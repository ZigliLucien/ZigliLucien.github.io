                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>POCO&apos;s F series has always been about delivering the best hardware in the mid-range segment, and while last year&apos;s F5 had a lot to offer in this area, the brand is taking things to a whole new level with the introduction of the F6 and F6 Pro. The F6 marks the debut of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 in most global markets, delivering flagship-tier performance.</p><p>That&apos;s just the start; the device also gets a new 120Hz AMOLED panel with increased resolution that now goes up to 2400 nits in HDR content, IP64 ingress protection, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4, and a new camera at the back that&apos;s significantly better than what I&apos;ve seen on a POCO phone thus far.</p><p>Xiaomi tends to rebrand existing devices and launch them under the POCO label, and that&apos;s no different with the F6 — the phone is identical to the Redmi Turbo 3 that debuted in April, but seeing as how that device isn&apos;t launching globally, there isn&apos;t going to be any overlap between the two.</p><p>What makes the F6 even better is the value; it manages to deliver better hardware than most of the options in this category, and does so for a lot less. That alone makes the phone worthy of a recommendation.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-pricing-and-availability"><span>POCO F6: Pricing and availability</span></h2>

<p>POCO unveiled the F6 and F6 Pro at a launch event in Dubai on May 23, and the devices are set to go on sale globally in the coming weeks. Both the F6 and F6 Pro are debuting in the U.K. and other western markets, and India is getting the standard F6 and not the Pro variant.</p><p>The POCO F6 is available in 8GB/256GB and 12GB/512GB storage variants, and there is also a 16GB/512GB model that will be available in select regions — this is the version I&apos;m using. All variants of the F6 come with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage modules.</p><p>What&apos;s notable is the pricing; the 8GB/256GB model of the F6 starts off at just $339, while the 12GB/512GB model is $379. The POCO F6 Pro, meanwhile, costs $449 for the 12GB/256GB model, $499 for the 16GB/512GB edition, and $579 for the 16GB/1TB version. </p><p>POCO introduced the POCO Pad alongside the two phones, and it is a rebranded version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-pro-review">Redmi Pad Pro</a> with the same 10000mAh battery, and at $299, it is also a great bargain.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-design"><span>POCO F6: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="f2iZhkRHSBpPuh2Bq7cfsc" name="poco-f6-review-7.jpg" alt="POCO F6 next to F6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2iZhkRHSBpPuh2Bq7cfsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO clearly likes to switch things up on the design front with every generation, and that&apos;s the case with the F6 as well. The brand hasn&apos;t overhauled the entire design, instead making a few tweaks that allows the F6 to differentiate itself from its predecessor. The biggest change is at the back, where the camera modules are now ensconced within massive rings, similar to that of ASUS&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">Zenfone 10</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RrhmdQebNDsz2ter5nD9ha" name="poco-f6-review-4.jpg" alt="Camera modules on the back of the POCO F6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrhmdQebNDsz2ter5nD9ha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The LED flash module sits to the right of the two modules, and it has been similarly enlarged. The design feels cohesive if you&apos;re getting the black color variant, but if you opt for the green or titanium colors, the black-accented cameras look out of place — POCO should have color-matched the modules to the back of the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cG48ioqFsxrbDsLA9XG3Zd" name="poco-f6-review-5.jpg" alt="POCO F6 regulatory labels at the back of the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cG48ioqFsxrbDsLA9XG3Zd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having said that, this isn&apos;t the ugliest design on a POCO phone — far from it. The brand has had its share of misses in the past (notably the F5 Pro), and although the F6 isn&apos;t elegant, it doesn&apos;t come across as ostentatious either. What I like about the new camera modules is that they don&apos;t protrude, so there isn&apos;t too much of a wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DuSYxvTCkfP7xogKn9ZWFa" name="poco-f6-review-9.jpg" alt="IR blaster and stereo sound of the POCO F6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuSYxvTCkfP7xogKn9ZWFa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO retained the same polycarbonate back and sides, and again, that isn&apos;t an issue at all. The back has a silky coat that minimizes smudging to an extent, and the matte texture on the sides makes it easy to hold and use the phone. The F6 is considerably light at 179g, and it has excellent weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nKUFd9x8qgDkYAKeuSeaTa" name="poco-f6-review-10.jpg" alt="Side view of POCO F6 with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nKUFd9x8qgDkYAKeuSeaTa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although it is using a plastic chassis, it doesn&apos;t feel that way when you use the device, and the build quality is outstanding. The back has a subtle curve along the sides where it meets the mid-frame, and that allows the F6 to nestle into your hand with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hLiHyNkMSHi5Tc5LrQrksa" name="poco-f6-review-11.jpg" alt="POCO F6 bottom view with USB-C and SIM tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLiHyNkMSHi5Tc5LrQrksa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much in the way of branding at the back either; other than the POCO logo and a 50MP OIS tagline to the right, the phone is devoid of overt branding. The rest of the design is pretty standard — the power and volume buttons are on the right, the SIM card tray is at the bottom next to the USB-C port, and you get stereo sound that&apos;s plenty decent.</p>
<p>POCO now offers IP64 dust and water resistance on the F6, and that allows the device to weather the elements much better. While you still can&apos;t submerge the phone under water — that&apos;s reserved for IP67 and IP68 — it can withstand splashes of water from any side.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-display"><span>POCO F6: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qtj7k2ug4pM6ZpZJ74LoQg" name="poco-f6-review-14.jpg" alt="POCO F6 home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qtj7k2ug4pM6ZpZJ74LoQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The F6 still has a 6.67-inch panel, but that&apos;s the only constant from last year. The AMOLED panel now has a higher resolution of 2712 x 1220, and it gets brighter — it is able to go up to 1200 nits in HBM mode, and 2400 nits in HDR content — and is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fsh98bvY4gSeYuUNiBmQDc" name="poco-f6-review-15.jpg" alt="POCO F6's selfie camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fsh98bvY4gSeYuUNiBmQDc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is set to the Original Colour Pro mode out of the box, and colors aren&apos;t noticeably vibrant — switching to the Vivid mode makes a big difference in daily use. As with all Xiaomi phones, the screen refresh is set to auto, and you&apos;ll need to go into the settings to manually toggle 120Hz. You can switch between 60Hz or 120Hz, and there&apos;s no option to choose 90Hz. The auto mode does a decent job switching between the two refresh rates, but I like to have 120Hz enabled all the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jf7rb38NLxQeA5bo5t6nBe" name="poco-f6-review-20.jpg" alt="POCO F6 video playing on the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jf7rb38NLxQeA5bo5t6nBe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s Widevine L1, and there are no issues playing 1080p content in streaming services. Xiaomi phones in general don&apos;t do a great job with Dolby Vision content, and that is the case with the POCO F6 as well. That said, the phone is terrific at gaming, and is able to play demanding titles at stable framerates. The stereo sound is good too; it isn&apos;t as detailed as high-end devices, but it is more than adequate when streaming content or casual gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qSzhkUVoLXeErLASBrrjHf" name="poco-f6-review-16.jpg" alt="POCO F6 icons on home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qSzhkUVoLXeErLASBrrjHf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the same set of customization options as other Xiaomi and POCO phones, including always-on styles, ability to tweak colors to your preferences, and extras like Reading mode. Like most Xiaomi phones, the F6 has 1920Hz PWM dimming, and there&apos;s an optical module this time. The only issue is that the module sits a little too low on the panel, making it awkward to access when using the phone one-handed. Other than that, the F6 nails the basics.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-performance-and-battery"><span>POCO F6: Performance and battery</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="agaXUxAjVSZMsNc9sPZJsd" name="poco-f6-review-17.jpg" alt="POCO F6 about section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/agaXUxAjVSZMsNc9sPZJsd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO is betting on the latest Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 to differentiate the F6 in the mid-range segment, and there is a lot to like with the platform. You get one Cortex X4 core that goes up to 3.0GHz, and it is joined by four 2.8GHz A720 cores that handle a bulk of the performance-related tasks, and three 2.0GHz A520 cores designed to deliver efficiency.</p><p>The Adreno 735 is interesting as well, and it allows the F6 to be a gaming powerhouse; it is one of the best devices in this category at gaming. The only downside is that it gets noticeably hot in marathon gaming sessions; the F6 went up to 46.2 degrees Celsius at the back, 45 degrees around the sides, and 49.2 degrees near the camera modules.</p>

<p>The upside is that with a stability score of 97.5% in 3DMark&apos;s Solar Bay stress test, the F6 is the best out of any mid-range phone I tested, and this is evident in real-world gaming scenarios as well. The phone doesn&apos;t throttle even with extended use, and you get steady framerates in visually demanding titles. It doesn&apos;t have the sheer power of the regular 8 Gen 3, but in the context of mid-range phones, it is a fantastic showing. </p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that there isn&apos;t much of a gulf between the F6 and the F6 Pro. The Pro model is powered by last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and is better at gaming, but in real-world usage scenarios, the F6 manages to hold its own even in demanding titles. </p><p>POCO isn&apos;t shortchanging users when it comes to the memory; all variants of the F6 feature LPDDR5X RAM modules as standard as well as UFS 4.0 storage, and that is a big deal in its own right. The base model has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&apos;s a 12GB/512GB edition that&apos;s available in most markets. POCO isn&apos;t bringing the 1TB variant outside China, and the 16GB/512GB model that I&apos;m using is similarly limited to select regions, but on the whole, the F6 has one of the best hardware packages in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xsAirScSK8eJJWKqeRW8Mb" name="poco-f6-review-12.jpg" alt="POCO F6 in-hand view showing biometric authentication" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xsAirScSK8eJJWKqeRW8Mb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That extends to connectivity as well, with the device offering Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and a good selection of AptX codecs, including AptX HD. It has dual-SIM connectivity and a decent set of 5G bands based on the region, and I didn&apos;t see any issues making calls or accessing cellular networks in the week I used the device.</p><p>The only quibble with the hardware is that the vibration motor isn&apos;t quite as good as the one on the F6 Pro; it is limited in its range, and doesn&apos;t deliver granular feedback. Outside of that, there are no problems with the F6 whatsoever.</p><p>Battery life has been terrific as well, and the phone manages to last a day and a half with ease. I didn&apos;t see the battery go below 15% even on days with heavy use, and like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-xiaomi-phones">best Xiaomi phones of 2024</a>, there is no battery anxiety whatsoever. And with the upgraded 90W charging now available, it takes just over 40 minutes to charge the F6. Thankfully, POCO continues to bundle a charger in the box.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-f6-cameras"><span>POCO F6: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rS9infDEr5BJycPLHey58b" name="poco-f6-review-8.jpg" alt="POCO F6 in-hand view highlighting camera modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rS9infDEr5BJycPLHey58b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cameras have never been the main focus for POCO, but that&apos;s changing with the F6; the device has a 50MP f/1.6 Sony IMX882 with OIS that takes decent photos in most situations. The main camera is joined by an 8MP Sony IMX355 wide-angle lens, and at the front you get a new 20MP f/2.2 camera that uses OmniVision&apos;s OV20B40.</p><p>POCO is finally being sensible about auxiliary cameras on the F6, and the phone doesn&apos;t get the 2MP macro module that&apos;s been a mainstay on most Xiaomi phones over the last three years. Considering the ineffectiveness of that sensor, it&apos;s good to see the brand not bundling it just for marketing reasons.</p><p>The camera interface itself hasn&apos;t changed, and you&apos;ll find all the usual toggles and settings in the same location. What is new, though, is the ability to shoot 4K video at 60fps; POCO hobbled this feature on its devices for the longest time, so it&apos;s great to see that video recording isn&apos;t a limitation now. You don&apos;t get much in the way of shooting modes or effects, but the F6 has all the basics available, and honestly, that&apos;s what you&apos;ll end up using anyway.</p>

<p>Coming to daylight shots, the F6 has good dynamic range and color rendition. You don&apos;t miss out on intricate details when it comes to clouds or foliage, and colors tend to be accurate. POCO&apos;s phones tend to boost the contrast a little, and it makes the resultant photos look great on social media.</p><p>Where the F6 shines over its predecessors is low-light imagery; the phone is able to take detailed shots at night, with little to no visible noise levels. Highlights and shadows are managed well, and while the exposure is on the conservative side, you can still make out a lot of minute detail. The phone does a much better job with portrait shots as well, including those of inanimate objects.</p><p>The wide-angle lens, on the other hand, is strictly average. It does a decent enough job in scenarios with good lighting, but it doesn&apos;t have the same color balance as the main lens, and it has issues with focusing and managing noise levels in low-light.</p><p>That said, the F6 is the best showing yet from POCO, and the phone manages to deliver a similar caliber of shots as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, and that&apos;s a huge deal in and of itself.</p>

<p>There isn&apos;t much to talk about when it comes to the software side of things. The device comes with HyperOS 1.0.3.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and while POCO uses a customized version of the interface with custom icons, there isn&apos;t much else that&apos;s different to what you get on Xiaomi phones.</p><p>In fact, the software is identical to MIUI 14, and other than the split notification pane and a few under-the-hood changes, you don&apos;t notice anything new. The quick toggles still don&apos;t have labels, and like all Xiaomi phones I&apos;ve used this year, it continues to be annoying. There is a lot of customizability on offer, and features like flexible windows allow you to make the most out of the interface.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ejoq6j9i3CWZQYudJKvEte" name="poco-f6-review-19.jpg" alt="POCO F6 notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejoq6j9i3CWZQYudJKvEte.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What is noticeable is the fluidity of the UI; it is better than the MIUI era, and it makes a difference in daily use. Outside of that, the interface has the same benefits — and foibles — as other Xiaomi phones, including annoying autostart issues and wonky push notifications. The most egregious issue is the sheer amount of bloatware on the device; most of it can be uninstalled, but the fact that Xiaomi continues to do this is plain frustrating.</p><p>As for software updates, the F6 and F6 Pro will get three updates as standard, and while that is less than the industry standard of four, it is better than what POCO guaranteed in the past. But as with other Xiaomi phones, there&apos;s no telling when you&apos;ll actually get the update; it&apos;s unlikely the phone will switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Nothing&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> continues to be a great choice in this category, particularly now that it is selling for just ₹40,999 ($492) in India. The Phone 2 also has a sublime OLED panel, powerful hardware, good battery life, and decent charging tech. Where it wins is the software; the clean interface with Nothing&apos;s extras give the phone a distinct edge, and you get two terrific cameras at the back. That said, the F6 has an advantage when it comes to value.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R is also a good recommendation; the phone is faster in daily use as well as gaming, and it has a better 50MP camera at the back along with 100W charging tech. I also like the design of the 12R quite a bit, and I prefer ColorOS to Xiaomi&apos;s software.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a mid-range gaming phone</li><li>You want a vibrant AMOLED</li><li>You need a good camera at the back</li><li>You want all-day battery with ultra-fast charging</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need clean software and timely updates</li><li>You want a good wide-angle lens</li></ul>
<p>POCO didn&apos;t put a foot wrong with the F6. The phone addresses the shortcomings of its predecessor on the hardware side of things, and it is close to the F6 Pro in a lot of areas — that&apos;s why POCO isn&apos;t launching the Pro variant in countries like India.</p><p>If anything, I think the standard model is a much better deal than the F6 Pro; you still get a lot of the same features, and it isn&apos;t short on power. The F6 Pro&apos;s main camera is noticeably better than the standard model, but that&apos;s the only area where it has a distinct advantage. Otherwise, the F6 is just as good, and the value you&apos;re getting with the device is unmatched. </p><p>Ultimately, that&apos;s what makes the F6 such a good option in this category. You&apos;re getting one of the best hardware packages around, the camera is a significant upgrade from the F5, and while the software needs another overhaul, it is fluid. If you need a value-focused gaming phone that takes good photos, the F6 is now my go-to recommendation in the mid-range segment.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon is reportedly stepping up to compete with OpenAI and Google by boosting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-alexa">Alexa</a> with generative AI features, but it’ll cost a monthly subscription fee to access.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/amazon-plans-to-give-alexa-an-ai-overhaul-monthly-subscription-price.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, Amazon is set to launch a new generative AI-powered Alexa this year that will require its own monthly subscription, separate from Amazon Prime. This move presumably aims to put Amazon in the ring with big players like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 Omni</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">Google’s Gemini 1.5</a>.</p><p>Alexa has been a handy tool for answering questions, setting reminders, and managing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a> for a long time. However, it&apos;s starting to show its age, especially compared to the latest breakthroughs in AI technology.</p><p>Ever since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, tech giants like Microsoft and Google have been hustling to upgrade their virtual assistants with generative AI. This new technology allows for more contextual interactions and smoother conversations. Google has even rolled out its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI assistant</a>, which users can swap for the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>.</p><p>CNBC reports that the upcoming Alexa update will make it more conversational, incorporating cutting-edge generative AI. While Amazon hasn&apos;t set a price yet, it looks like this enhanced Alexa will require a separate monthly subscription beyond the annual $139 Amazon Prime fee. An insider mentioned that each generative AI query could cost around 2 cents, and there&apos;s talk of a possible $20 monthly subscription that&apos;s been discussed internally.</p><p>OpenAI and Google both offer their premium AI subscriptions for $20 a month. However, Google’s package includes extra perks like additional storage that can be used across its various products.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first hint that Amazon is planning to charge for an AI-enhanced Alexa. Last year, Amazon’s then-senior vice president of devices and services, David Limp, mentioned to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23880764/amazon-ai-alexa-generative-llm-smart-home" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the retail giant would likely charge for a supercharged AI version of Alexa.</p><p>In his recent letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy also mentioned that an AI upgrade is on the horizon for Alexa.</p><p>The latest report aligns with what Business Insider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-working-on-premium-alexa">revealed earlier this year about Amazon&apos;s plans for Alexa</a>. The earlier report set a launch date of June 30 and dubbed the technology "Remarkable Alexa." If these details hold, Amazon&apos;s AI-powered Alexa announcement could coincide with Apple&apos;s expected reveal of an AI-enabled Siri in the same month.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Pay now lets you see your credit card benefits directly in the checkout process on Chrome, helping you choose the best card based on perks like cash back or travel points.</li><li>The service is also broadening its BNPL options with Affirm and Zip, allowing you to pay in installments on more websites.</li><li>Instead of typing in security codes, Chrome and Android users can confirm their card details using biometric methods like fingerprints or facial recognition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pay has rolled out a bunch of new features, like viewing card benefits at checkout, using "buy now, pay later" options on more websites, and securing card details with biometrics or a PIN instead of security codes.</p><p>Google mentioned in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-pay-online-checkout-features/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that it&apos;s easy to forget which credit card to use since different cards offer different perks. Some might give you benefits for travel, while others are better for dining or cash back.</p><p>Now, when you pick a payment method in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> on your desktop, a drop-down menu will pop up. It lists your cards and now includes a handy description of benefits, such as the cash back percentage or point multipliers for specific categories like travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.90%;"><img id="hhs32rSiTjYNCehAHJsUZF" name="Google-Pay-card-benefits.jpg" alt="Google Pay showing card benefits upon checkout" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhs32rSiTjYNCehAHJsUZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you check out, a card might show perks like "1.5% cash back on purchases" or "3x points on flights." For the time being, this feature is only available for American Express and Capital One cards and works exclusively on the Chrome desktop browser.</p><p>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> is extending its buy now, pay later (BNPL) feature to more websites. You can select a third-party provider like Affirm or Zip to split your payment into installments. But be cautious—missing payments can lead to collection actions or damage your credit score.</p><p>Lastly, Google is simplifying the process of confirming your card without needing the security code. Now, Chrome and Android users can verify their card details using the same method they use to unlock their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>—be it a fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock PIN. Users can also set up an option that requires them to unlock their device before their card details are displayed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:549px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:195.63%;"><img id="XoFanR65PmUkxuXiGUEJrV" name="Google-Pay-autofill-verification.gif" alt="Google Pay autofill verification" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoFanR65PmUkxuXiGUEJrV.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="549" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These updates aim to improve how consumers use Google Pay, making it a more appealing choice compared to other payment methods, like those built into retailers&apos; systems.</p>

<ul><li>Microsoft is launching a brand new mixed reality experience in Windows with Volumetric Apps on the Meta Quest platform.</li><li>Developers can sign up to preview the new development API, allowing them to bring their existing apps into 3D space.</li><li>Microsoft says that its example app, Creo, took only a single day to turn into a Volumetric App with the new API.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft may have pulled the plug on its Windows Mixed Reality VR platform at the end of 2023, but the company continues to invest in other VR platforms with yet another new announcement. The company says that Volumetric Apps, its answer to Apple&apos;s Spatial apps, will be coming to Meta Quest headsets via the Windows platform in the near future.</p><p>Developers can sign up for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.co/ru5kdOmtqW">Volumetric Apps API</a> and be among the first to migrate apps into a spatial environment, making it easier for customers to interface with them while wearing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> headset.</p><p>Microsoft showed off the new API at Build 2024, its annual developer conference, but kept the presentation short. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1792974464424317307">one-minute demo</a>, Microsoft showed off Creo, a CAD-based engineering software, along with the user manipulating and customizing an Xbox controller in 3D space.</p>

<p>Microsoft says that Volumetric Apps will be coming to the Meta Quest platform, suggesting that the company is further enhancing its relationship with Meta and potentially providing a Quest-exclusive way to run Windows.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft announced that Meta Quest 3 users will be able to use Windows 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-is-getting-windows-11-and-microsoft-office">from the headset</a> but has yet to reveal more specific plans. Presumably, Microsoft will utilize Meta&apos;s own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/">Quest Link</a> software so users can connect to their PCs either wirelessly or via a USB-C cable.</p><p>In addition to Volumetric Apps, Meta Quest owners can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">stream Xbox Game Pass</a> to their headsets and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-office-is-finally-available-on-meta-quest-headsets">use Microsoft Office</a>. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest headset</a> is also expected to arrive sometime later this year.</p>

<ul><li>More users are beginning to notice Google's new single-line text field redesign for Messages.</li><li>Previously, the field would contain various shortcuts but those will are now lessened and will disappear once a user begins typing.</li><li>Google started testing an edit button for texts in its Messages beta, giving users 15 minutes to go back and fix mistakes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Messages is starting to pick up its text field redesign as it rolls out "widely" to more users.</p><p>The redesign moves many of the icons that muddled the text field, bringing a cleaner single-line design, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/22/google-messages-single-line-text-field/">9to5Google</a>. The UI previously held icons for Magic Compose and Gallery, among others.</p><p>Now, what users should begin noticing is an emoji smile (icon) on the far left of the text box. The far right will now display a plus icon, opening the sub-menu for your gallery, GIF search, stickers, files, and more.</p><p>The redesign sees the text field go from the left side of your screen to the right before hitting the vocal moods icon by default. Inside, users will notice an emoji smile (icon) on the far left of the text box. The far right will now display a gallery and a plus icon, which opens the sub-menu for your gallery, GIF search, stickers, files, and more.</p><p>However, once you begin typing, the gallery icon disappears, leaving the plus icon ready to open up that secondary panel.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.49%;"><img id="tZcYab95bN3bAyoVG3xxsF" name="google-messages-single-line-text-field-default-redesign.jpg" alt="Google Messages is picking up a single-line text field redesign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZcYab95bN3bAyoVG3xxsF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="548" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.49%;"><img id="nJeqbFKQx9gXDqpJK3MLEL" name="google-messages-single-line-text-field-redesign.jpg" alt="When users start typing, Messages' single-line text field drops its gallery icon, leaving the emojis and plus symbol." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJeqbFKQx9gXDqpJK3MLEL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="548" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Curiously, 9to5 notes that while the update has been seen more widely, users on the stable version of Messages still have the old look. The previous single-line field design slid the box over to the right, giving ample space for auxiliary icons. Our internal tests with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> show that the right-aligned text field is still active in stable mode.</p><p>If you&apos;re also seeing this, continue to check for updates for Messages as we enter the later portion of the week.</p><p>With this slight redesign arriving for the stable app version, Google has started a test for beta testers, which involves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-text-editing-beta-changes-spotted">a text edit button</a>. Long-pressing a recently sent text will produce a pencil (edit) icon on the top bar. Users can quickly correct any mistakes, which will be reflected on the other parties&apos; devices. Note: users have a shorter 15-minute time limit to edit texts, instead of 30, as previously seen.</p><p>May also held the debut of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-starts-getting-voice-moods-and-recorder-redesign">Voice Moods</a>" in Messages. Users can access nine voice moods alongside relevant emojis to tack onto it. The cards users see in their messaging threads are colorful and fun, with emojis plastered all around them.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has reportedly decided to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC in the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 "exclusively" in 2024.</li><li>The report suggests that the company considered "cost control" and "efficiency" when making the decision.</li><li>It was previously rumored that Samsung would swap Qualcomm and its Exynos chip in the U.S. and other regions, as it did last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new report claims that Samsung is preparing to lean on Qualcomm&apos;s latest flagship chip only for its upcoming foldable phones.</p><p>The information stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4847">The Elec</a> (Korean), who states the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 will only feature the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/22/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-snapdragon-8-gen-3-report/">9to5Google</a>). The devices are expected to see the "For Galaxy" tag attached to the chipset, similar to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">flagship smartphones</a>, once they launch.</p><p>Additionally, the publications added that Samsung "considered cost control" when choosing Qualcomm&apos;s chip. The report states that Samsung based its creation of the Flip 6 and Fold 6 on Qualcomm&apos;s flagship chip.</p><p>The company would reportedly run the risk of driving up the cost of its devices if another processor was tossed into the mix.</p><p>The other processor this is referring to is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">Exynos 2400</a>. The publication states that Samsung did not snub its own SoC due to its performance. Rather, siding with Qualcomm throughout was made on the foundation of "efficiency."</p><p>Moreover, it seems that the company is waiting for its Z series foldables to reach the numbers of its S series phones "before adding another processor."</p>

<p>In March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-display-memory-rumors">it was speculated</a> that Samsung would follow a route similar to the Galaxy S24 series. The company packed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the devices for the U.S. but slid in the Exynos 2400 in other regions. The change in chip <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">didn&apos;t seem like a bad thing</a>, as Samsung boosted its in-house chip with a new CPU and NPU for speed and other enhancements.</p><p>However, Samsung reportedly plans to shift to Qualcomm exclusivity for its foldables in 2024, which could be a boon for consumers.</p><p>Those rumors suggested the Flip 6 could feature a 120Hz refresh rate cover display, an upgrade over last year&apos;s 60Hz. The clamshell could pick up an 8GB and a 12GB RAM variant alongside a 256GB and 512GB storage option. Its crease could also become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-display-crease-reduction-rumor">a little less visible</a> with a thicker UTG (ultra-thin glass).</p><p>On the other hand, the Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-z-fold-6-may-skip-a-key-upgrade-for-smartphones-in-2024">was rumored</a> to forgo any battery upgrades in 2024, as speculation stated it would stick with 25W charging speeds. This is likely to be paired with the same 4,400mAh battery.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut both devices for its summer Unpacked later this year. The event could occur even earlier this year on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors surface, regarding the Galaxy Ring's supposed $300 to $350 price range in the U.S.</li><li>The tipster on X then claimed that Samsung is looking at bringing a subscription service to the Samsung Health app for "under $10."</li><li>The Galaxy Ring is expected to come in a wide range of American ring sizes, potentially from 5 to 13 and with a rumored 10-day battery life.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Speculation suggests Samsung could price its smart ring similarly to Oura&apos;s, alongside a rumored subscription service.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1793155170093969897">Yogesh Brar</a> on X, Samsung may price the Galaxy Ring anywhere between $300 and $350 in the U.S. (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-subscription-price-leak-3445434/">Android Authority</a>). Notably, this supposed pricing range is similar to how Oura prices its smart ring. Brar adds that Samsung&apos;s version could see a ₹35,000 price tag in India.</p><p>However, a discussion between the tipster and the publication unearthed the possibility of a subscription service for the Ring. Citing unnamed sources, Brar reportedly stated that the Galaxy Ring "could" come with a monthly subscription service priced "under $10."</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that Oura&apos;s monthly plan for its app sits at $5.99.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Ring as of now is priced at Rs 35k in India.US price in the $300-350 rangePretty expensive piece of tech..<a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1793155170093969897">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The subscription service idea isn&apos;t entirely new, as the publication highlights an interview between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/samsung-galaxy-ring-specs-features-release-date.html#:~:text=The%20executive%20also%20said%20the%20company%20is%20%E2%80%9Cconsidering%E2%80%9D%20a%20subscription%20service%20for%20its%20Samsung%20Health%20app%2C%20but%20that%20the%20capabilities%20and%20insights%20it%20offers%20need%20to%20be%20improved%20before%20that%20can%20happen.%20AI%20assistants%20can%20help.">CNBC</a> and Samsung&apos;s Dr. Hon Pak. During the interview, the Korean OEM&apos;s Head of Digital Health mentioned there was "consideration" behind a service for the Samsung Health app.</p><p>Pak did not get into specifics but did mention that improvements to the app&apos;s insights and capabilities were needed before a service could occur.</p><p>There&apos;s a possibility that the supposed pricing "range" for the Galaxy Ring could involve a leak from April. Last month, the device&apos;s various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-model-number-sizes-leak">model identification numbers</a> appeared, pointing toward its many ring sizes. Eight identifiers were leaked alongside word that Samsung was basing its Galaxy Ring off American ring sizes. The device could launch with sizes ranging from 5 to 13.</p><p>The company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-showcase-at-mwc-2024">MWC 2024 appearance</a> highlighted the Galaxy Ring and its platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black finishes. There were also rumors that Samsung could pack enough battery into the device for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-may-last-almost-ten-days">nearly 10 days</a>. That would beat the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring 3</a>, which is estimated to last a week.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">summer Unpacked event</a> could occur even earlier this year on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">standalone Gemini app</a> in February 2024, but today — months later — it&apos;s still unavailable for some phones that meet the requirements like the Moto Razr. </p><p>Officially, the requirements for the app are very light. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14579026?hl=en">According to Google</a>&apos;s support page on Gemini, "the Gemini mobile app is available on Android phones, including many foldables, with 2 GB of RAM or more, running Android 10 and up." You also have to have your phone set to one of 19 supported languages and live in one of over 150 supported countries.</p>
<p>So yeah, these requirements are really easy to meet but don&apos;t tell the whole story. They never do.</p><p>We reached out to Google about this and they told us “<em>The Razr isn’t supported just yet but we are working on it and aim to have it available soon.</em>” This doesn&apos;t really answer the question of why. Everyone is sure that Google will make it available one day but there always seems to be some other hidden set of rules about which phones see which features, and when.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1162px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Vhqv3twceBdZgLJDHzxTQU" name="Gemini.png" alt="Google Gemini app availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vhqv3twceBdZgLJDHzxTQU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1162" height="654" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s not just the Razr, either. You would think Google wants Gemini available for all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, but it isn&apos;t. For example, the Gemini app is officially available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. Some carrier models, though, can&apos;t install it. That&apos;s the case with the AT&T version I have here on my desk. There seems to be no rhyme or reason and without a list of all supported devices — which Google does not provide — you have to try it yourself to know if you can get the app.</p><p>To make things even more confusing, the app was available for a short time for some phones that are no longer supported. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Moto Razr</a> you could install it from Google Play when it was first released but now it&apos;s gone and you&apos;re left with an unsupported app that could have security and functionality issues.</p>
<p>Since there is no obvious technical reason as to why, it has to be something else right? I mean if the Razr (which meets all the requirements) was on the initial rollout list and some Z Flip models can run it without any issues it can&apos;t be hardware limitations holding it back. </p><p>This isn&apos;t exactly a new phenomenon. It seems like every time Google has a new software product initial availability is limited in some way or another. Sometimes the reasons seem to make sense, like language or region support, but other times it feels like Google is simply playing favorites. And sometimes, like with the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">circle-to-search feature</a>, Google <em>is</em> playing favorites.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Su3LQaUCmh8Do3hZzcfaxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-comparison-3.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Razr Plus back panels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Su3LQaUCmh8Do3hZzcfaxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is an explanation that only really makes sense when you consider how many different Android phones are out there — Google is trying to control the experience and doesn&apos;t want to release anything that doesn&apos;t meet its performance expectations.</p><p>Admittedly, that feels like a low bar to set considering how ... goofy ... some Google products are at launch. Ultimately, Google just wants everything to work in a way that people don&apos;t complain about. I don&apos;t mean tech enthusiasts with high expectations, but the fabled "average consumer" that makes up the bulk of worldwide smartphone sales. They want to install the cool new thing and do cool new things with it.</p>
<p>There may be performance issues on some phones. The Moto Razr or certain software variants of the Flip 5 are very different under the hood when compared to something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. This is bound to happen when you allow different companies to build their own OS from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">your code base</a>. Since Gemini replaces Assistant in most cases, the software wasn&apos;t built with it in mind. </p><p>I don&apos;t have the answers here, nor does anyone else who isn&apos;t working on the Gemini team at Google. I do know how to "fix" it though: transparency.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.42%;"><img id="p257SEtNaBQcbGg2AYkYUb" name="IMG_6851.jpg" alt="Google Gemini availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p257SEtNaBQcbGg2AYkYUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1179" height="842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Google were to come out and say something like "There are issues with the always-listening component of Google Gemini on the Moto Razr and we&apos;re working with the team at Motorola to resolve them", nobody would hate them for it. (<em>Note that this is just an example and I have no idea what any issues may be</em>.) We all understand that writing complicated software isn&apos;t easy, and would probably appreciate that Google is trying to make sure everything works well before dumping another product on us all.</p><p>Being left in the dark is never a good look and a big reason why people think Apple does it better. Nothing is shipped until it&apos;s ready for every iPhone. Maybe those people are right and Google needs to change how it rolls out new software products.</p><p>Either way, it wouldn&apos;t hurt to let us know a bit about what&apos;s going on.</p>

<p>Humane, the company that owns the wearable AI pin, is now looking for a potential buyer, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/wearable-ai-startup-humane-is-said-to-explore-potential-sale">Bloomberg</a>. "People familiar with the matter" told the publication that Humane is seeking a price between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale. However, the process seems to be in its initial stages and may not result in a deal. </p><p>The same source told Bloomberg that "the company is working with a financial adviser to assist the potential sale." The Information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/has-humane-created-the-next-iphone-or-the-next-google-glass?rc=bdqvyp">reported</a> that investors valued Humane at $850 million last year. For now, the company has not publicly commented on the matter. </p><p>Humane was founded in 2018 by two ex-Apple designers, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno. By 2023, they secured a massive $230 million, with some of their investors being OpenAI and Microsoft. Humane announced their AI Pin, a minimalistic magnetic, voice-controlled device with AI assistance that allows users to do everything from making calls to controlling music with vocal commands.</p>

<p>After months of creating a buzz about the laser-projecting wearable pin, Humane started shipping its devices in April this year for $699 and an additional $24/month subscription + taxes and fees. </p><p>Following several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://autogpt.net/humane-ai-pin-is-seeking-a-buyer-after-facing-challenges/#:~:text=Struggles%20and%20Criticisms,concept%20behind%20the%20AI%20Pin.">complaints</a> about the pin&apos;s cost-effectiveness, slow response rate, and accuracy, the company took to X to inform users that they were bringing Ai Mic accuracy improvements across user support, video stabilization, and contacts experience improvements. </p><p>On May 15, following Open AI&apos;s multimodal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">GPT-4o launch</a>, Humane announced that it would integrate GPT-4o into the Ai Bus to help the pin understand and react to voice requests. This means that the AI pin will depend highly on OpenAI&apos;s software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">leaving it vulnerable</a> to the choice that users would eventually make, i.e., they might choose to get similar features on their phones rather than spending $700 on a dedicated AI pin. </p>
