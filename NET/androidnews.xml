<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google Phone app is set for a makeover, swapping out the single call button for a new look featuring dedicated buttons for accepting and rejecting calls.</li><li>The accept button will be on the right, and the reject button on the left, unlike Samsung’s layout, which is flipped.</li><li>This feature seems to be in limited testing, so not everyone will see it right away, even if they have the latest app version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Phone app on your Android devices could be getting a fresh look soon, replacing the single button that currently shows up when you get a call.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-incoming-call-ui-test-apk-teardown-3485981/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is testing a new incoming call screen in the latest Phone app update (version 145.0.672690850), and it looks a lot like the iPhone’s call interface.</p><p>Right now, the Google Phone app uses a swipe method to manage calls—swipe up to answer, swipe down to decline. This is different from iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, which have separate green and red buttons for answering or rejecting calls. People familiar with those setups will probably find Google’s upcoming interface change more user-friendly.</p><p>Sitting above the phone button is a "Message" option that makes it easy to fire off a quick text, letting the caller know you&apos;re tied up or can’t talk at the moment.</p><p>The report shows off a screenshot of the Phone app&apos;s refreshed incoming call screen, replacing the old swipe-to-accept button with dedicated buttons for answering and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-incoming-calls">rejecting calls</a>. This shift mirrors the iPhone’s dialer and the call screens on many other Android devices, like Samsung’s.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH" name="Google-Phone-app-New-incoming-call-UI.jpg" alt="New Google Phone app interface for incoming calls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="360" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iDeepak_Sharma / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The color-coded buttons make the interface easier to use, providing quick visual cues that help users respond faster, especially in busy situations.</p><p>To make things easier to reach, the accept button is on the right side of the interface, while the reject button is on the left. In contrast, Samsung takes a different approach, with the accept button on the left and the reject button on the right.</p><p>It’s hard to say how many people are seeing this feature since it looks like it’s just being tested with a small group of users who updated to the latest app version.</p><p>Google appears to be rolling out the new incoming call screen UI with a server-side toggle, so even if you’ve got the latest Phone app version, you might not spot this feature just yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many Quest 3S games will have graphical enhancements over the Quest 2?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>As of fall 2024, there are nearly 100 Meta Quest 2 games we know of with specific Quest 3 and 3S patches for improved performance and graphics, and the total number could be higher. Plus, there are dozens of Quest 3S games with mixed-reality modes that look much worse with Quest 2 passthrough.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, your games library will have faster loading times by default. However, some developers patch their games to fully exploit the extra power for higher refresh rates, new textures, better lighting and shadows, and other visual upgrades that the Quest 2 couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Meta confirmed in its <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-3s-announced-connect-2024" target="_blank">Connect 2024 blog post</a> that any "games ... that received Quest 3-specific performance updates will also work day one on Quest 3S, which means you’ll benefit from the same upgraded visuals and faster load times."</p>
<p>We also spoke with Meta VP Mark Rabkin at Meta Connect 2024 about this, and he confirmed that there is "100% compatibility between the 3S and the 3" in terms of game performance.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-meta-quest-3s-game-enhancements-can-you-expect-2">What Meta Quest 3S game enhancements can you expect?</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hgLkjfQ7oM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>By default, the Meta Quest 3S has better GPU performance than the Quest 2 thanks to its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. But otherwise, Quest 3S games will still <em>look</em> and <em>run</em> like Quest 2 games unless developers patch them to take greater advantage of the new hardware.</p><p>In the Quest 3 graphical showcases above and below, you can see how Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Chapter 2 and Red Matter 2 look dramatically better on the Quest 3 because of Quest 3-specific patches.</p><p>In Walking Dead, Skydance could only add a few zombies on screen at a time with the Quest 2, but can fit entire hordes onto the Quest 3 version, making it more challenging. Walls and buildings have much more detail, outdoor environments lose the obscuring fog and look more vibrant, and NPCs appear more real. This will also apply to the Quest 3S.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljehojScnCQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/red-matter-2-first-impressions">Red Matter 2</a>, developer Vertical Robot specifically pointed out how the Quest 3 patch added increased rendering resolution and 4K textures with 16X the pixel count in the environment, as well as dynamic shadows and high-quality shadow filtering.</p><p>There&apos;s no universal list of Quest 3S enhancements because developers use the extra power however they choose. But the most common enhancements are higher refresh rates, more detail at further distances, and better textures, shading, and reflections. </p><p>These updates originally targeted the Quest 3 and offered resolution boosts. The Meta Quest 3S can&apos;t take advantage of this because it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">loses to the Quest 3</a> for display resolution, FoV, and clarity. However, all of the other Quest 3 graphical and performance enhancements apply to the Quest 3S by default.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-games-with-meta-quest-3s-enhancements-will-there-be-2">How many games with Meta Quest 3S enhancements will there be?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GY2MCBVN7ebB4yC6waP4He" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-1.jpeg" alt="A man wearing the Meta Quest 3S playing an exercise game." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GY2MCBVN7ebB4yC6waP4He.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Meta doesn&apos;t have a specific Quest Store category for every Quest 3 game with enhancements that we could find. But it does have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/7552117818138723/">mixed-reality games section</a> that includes over 60 titles as of September 2024; some of these may technically work on Quest 2 with its black-and-white, 4 pixels-per-degree passthrough, but they look significantly better with full-color, 18 PPD passthrough.</p><p>Mixed reality aside, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAOsGIT1pZZssiyt-TjI-pAwCsEWCo3kCmqV7fmnG0s/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">unofficial spreadsheet</a> from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dkxc4c/list_of_quest_3_upgraded_games/?rdt=41740">Redditor FrancoisFromFrance</a> has a list of about 90 Quest 2 games that received Meta Quest 3 patches, and the total number may be higher. It should give you a general idea of which of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> will immediately look next-gen on Meta Quest 3S.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a>, most developers launch with a universal Quest version and then add a Quest 3 patch as a post-launch add-on. That&apos;s why we expect the total number of Quest 3S enhancements to balloon even higher now that Meta has two headsets with next-gen CPUs and no longer sells the Quest 2.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-meta-quest-3s-exclusives-2">What about Meta Quest 3S exclusives?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sVDfKfTJ2pRi4z7uAhfLDa" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-environment-still.jpeg" alt="A still from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing the game's environment, including the Bat Signal in the sky." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVDfKfTJ2pRi4z7uAhfLDa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we mentioned above, some mixed-reality Quest 3 games technically work on Quest 2, but not especially well. Others are VR games with mixed-reality modes that only work on the Quest 3. And a few MR games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/laser-dance/7209598115800315/">Laser Dance</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hello-dot/25825290007070369/">Hello Dot</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/living-room/7778145568911617/">Living Room</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/starship-home/5959677854068956/">Starship Home</a> will be Meta Quest 3S and 3 exclusives because full-color passthrough is essential to gameplay.</p><p>We expect most mixed-reality games in 2025 and beyond will be Quest 3S exclusives, while VR games with MR modes will still work on both headsets.</p><p>A second, much smaller category is AAA games that only work on the Quest 3 and 3S because the Quest 2 can&apos;t handle the graphics. So far, that only applies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hitman-3-vr-reloaded/8012387035448196/">Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded</a>, which has received middling reviews and still seems to struggle on newer hardware. </p><p>Two future games — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/alien-rogue-incursion/24882487241367228/">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> — are the only other Quest 3S exclusives we know of, though that list will likely grow over time. Of these, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">tried out Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> for ourselves and were blown away by its polish and scope. </p><p>If you want more information on the Meta Quest 3S hardware and whether you want to upgrade from the Quest 2, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S hands-on</a> from the Connect event!</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S has the same CPU, 8GB of RAM, full-color passthrough, weight, and accessories as the Quest 3 while costing $200 less. It gives you access to the same Quest game enhancements and exclusives, though not the same resolution.</p></p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at how these two phones compare in terms of design. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, the newest addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 line</a>, falls into its “Fan Edition” line. It has a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 3x FHD+ 1,080 x 2,340 display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60 to 120Hz, depending on the application at hand. The display also features Vision Booster, which helps boost the brightness in outdoor environments along with 1,900 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Available in fun colors like Blue, Graphite, Mint, or Yellow, it’s durable with an IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating. With an aluminum frame, the screen is also Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ for added durability. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">his initial Galaxy S24 FE hands-on review</a>, Android Central senior editor Andrew Myrick says the phone looks virtually identical to the previous generation Samsung Galaxy S23 FE and even to the Galaxy S24 Plus. </p><p>It comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage that isn’t expandable beyond cloud services. So, you’ll want to pay extra for the largest option if you tend to snap a lot of photos and videos, keep files, playing games, or download lots of apps. </p><p>Running Android 14 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">Samsung One UI 6.1</a>, you get the latest OS along with seven years of OS and security updates. So, you can be confident that this phone will last and be usable and relevant for many years to come, beyond just its physical durability. </p><p>In terms of battery life, the 4,700mAh battery promises “long-lasting” life of about up to 21 hours of Internet usage. It also includes fast charging that will get you back up to 50 percent after a half-hour charge using a separately purchased 25W adapter and 3A USB-C cable. It also boasts fast wireless charging with WPC chargers and Wireless PowerShare. </p><p>Other basics include Bluetooth 5.3, which includes Bluetooth hearing aid support, Samsung Knox security, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> support, SmartThings support, and, of course, 5G connectivity. The phone will be officially available for purchase at the beginning of October 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb" name="google-pixel-8a-lockscreen-green.jpg" alt="The lockscreen of the Google Pixel 8a with large, chunky clock numbers and a green theme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> compare? Announced in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a is the affordable alternative in the Pixel 8 line, which has since been followed up with by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> line. It surprisingly has many of the same features you’ll find in the Google Pixel 8, but with a smaller 6.1-inch Actua OLED screen with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,400 nits brightness or 2,000 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Its screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which also has a fingerprint-resistant coating. However, it has a lesser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-pixel-8a-waterproof">IP67 water and dust-resistant rating</a>, so it isn’t as durable as the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in that respect. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-8a-should-you-buy">Pixel 8a color options</a> include Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, or a limited-edition Aloe color, and the Google Pixel 8a is made of matte composite with a matte aluminum frame. Nicholas Sutrich said in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">his Pixel 8a review</a> that he likes the rounded corners and finds the phone comfortable to hold.  </p><p>It comes loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and the same seven years of OS and security updates along with Feature Drops that bring new functions to the phone on a consistent basis. So, both devices will hold their value. </p><p>You get only 128GB or 256GB storage options and no expandable memory card slot, so keep this in mind if you think you’ll need more space. There are always cloud services, but Samsung offers a 512GB option for a bit more money, which might be more palatable. However, keep in mind that the Google Pixel 8a comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> trial, though you’ll still need a long-term solution if you’re a digital packrat. </p><p>With a 4,492mAh battery, you get a rated more than a day per charge, though it’s still technically a smaller battery than what’s in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>. You can also extend battery life to up to 72 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode, which limits functions if you just need to make sure it doesn’t die on your before you can get to a power outlet. It also supports both fast and wireless charging. </p><p>There are also stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, and all the other expected inclusions.</p>

<p>Before diving into the operation and cameras, let’s take an at-a-glance look at the specs.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences between these two phones, including in the processor, cameras, and overall size.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-generative-edit-1.jpg" alt="Generative Edit on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNTdhCtKCibQXPvVFyJVaH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you find the other Samsung Galaxy S24 series phones too rich for your blood, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE was launched at the end of September 2024 to help bring a premium experience to the masses on a budget. </p><p>While the phone, which runs Android 14, includes all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI goodies</a> you would expect in a premium device, it’s also powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400 series chipset</a>, which means it might not run as efficiently as the higher-end models in the line. The processor is Samsung’s own, designed to compete against rivals (like Google’s Tensor G3). It’s used in variants of many Samsung phones in other countries. Samsung claims it offers increased CPU performance and particularly a boost in AI performance.</p><p>In his brief hands-on tests of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, Myrick found the processor fast and snappy. However, he notes that Samsung uses Snapdragon processors in the other Galaxy S24 devices, so the phone has a clear disadvantage with its underclocked Exynos chip.</p><p>Samsung says this processor enables a favorable gaming experience thanks to features like Ray Tracing and a larger vapor chamber to improve cooling. Features like the bigger battery and screen, refresh rate, and Vision Booster also presumably contribute to the mobile gaming experience. The phone has 8GB RAM, which is sufficient for multitasking, gaming, and more. </p><p>In terms of AI, you can access all the same AI features you can on other Galaxy S24 devices. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for searching or scribbling over an item on a web page or in a video, for example, to learn more about it. There’s also Interpreter Mode for translating in-person conversations, lectures, presentations, and more. It’s even usable when offline. With Live Translate, you can translate phone calls in real time, including using popular third-party apps. </p><p>For productivity, there’s also Composer that generates suggested text based on keywords in e-mails and supported social media apps. Note Assist, meanwhile, helps you while taking notes by automating formatting and translation, even transcribing and summarizing voice recordings. </p><p>One thing Myrick wonders, however, is if the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE will be left behind when new, more powerful AI tools are launched that it can’t support. That’s something to think about if the AI experience is at the top of your mind. </p><p>With Samsung Knox, you get multiple layers of security to protect your sensitive data and web surfing. This includes real-time threat detection.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a is powered by the same Google Tensor G3 chip you’ll find in other Google Pixel phones launched in 2023, so there’s no step down in that respect. It also has 8GB RAM and the same AI features you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE and its Pixel siblings, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.  </p><p>Google adds some additional flavor through the built-in Gemini AI assistant, including Pixel Call Assist, Call Screen, Direct My Call, Hold for Me, Clear Calling, and more. With Audio Emoji, you can create your own soundtrack audio effects during a call, like applause or laughing. </p><p>Sufficient for gaming, too, the Google Pixel 8a’s thermal management is one area that Sutrich highlights as being especially impressive. In his tests, it performed even better than the Pixel 8 Pro. So, if you’re a gamer, this phone will work for you, too. </p><p>Protected by security features as well, the Google Pixel 8a comes with VPN by Google One, the Tensor security core, a Titan M2 security chip, and anti-malware and phishing protection. Use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Family Link</a> to manage privacy settings for kids, set screen time limits, and share location.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-selfie-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Selfie Camera viewfinder on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s look at the camera experience. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has a 50MP wide lens along with an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. Both are supported by optical image stabilization (OIS). There’s also a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP selfie camera. These are decent specs but nothing to write home about. </p><p>What does stand out is Samsung’s ProVisual Engine, an AI-driven camera engine that the company says helps improve your photos and videos. AI image signal processing (ISP), for example, helps improve low light photography when in Nightography mode. AI zoom helps enhance image quality at distances between digital zoom lengths. </p><p>There’s also an Object-Aware Engine that recognizes scenes and optimizes colors in Super High Dynamic Range (HDR) so you get more lifelike photos and videos, according to Samsung. </p><p>There are neat photo editing tools as well through Photo Assist once you have captured images and want to make them better. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a> can be used to move or remove objects in the background. Portrait Studio allows you to apply styles to photos, like cartoon, comics, watercolor painting, or sketch. With Edit Suggestion, remove flaws in photos like reflections. Instant Slow-mo, meanwhile, helps create more compelling videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-04.jpg" alt="Taking a picture with the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Naturally, the Google Pixel 8a also has some compelling photo-taking and editing features that leverage AI. It has a larger 64MP quad PD wide camera with Super Res Zoom up to 8x. The ultra-wide camera is 13MP combined with a 13MP front camera. You don’t get a telephoto camera with this phone, though. </p><p>Enjoy Google features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for moving or resizing objects and using preset backgrounds, and Best Take for taking the best elements of several photos of the same thing (think group photo) to create the best one. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for removing distracting elements from a photo, Photo Unblur for adding clarity to otherwise blurry photos, Real Tone for more accurate skin tones, Face Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and more. For videos, there’s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature that you can use to remove distracting background noise. </p><p>After trying the Pixel 8a cameras, Sutrich says the results are fabulous, with good contrast, color accuracy, and capturing of subjects in motion. For now, we have not been able to extensively test the Galaxy S24 FE, but we plan to fully evaluate the camera in a full review.</p>

While the Google Pixel 8a is slightly older, it’s still a relatively new phone that offers seven years of OS and security updates. And it hasn’t even been a year since it came to market. Considering it&apos;s cheaper, has a more powerful processor, tons of AI features, and isn’t that big a step down from the Google Pixel 8, that phone offers tremendous value for money and is the better option of the two. It remains the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> you can buy. </p><p>With the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, you’re dealing with a (potentially) pared-down processor, and while we haven’t tested it fully yet, it may not run as efficiently as you hope in the long run nor be able to support AI features coming down the pipe years from now. If you’re a casual user, you might not mind. However, considering that it’s still more expensive than the Google Pixel 8a, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE might not make sense to many. Myrick agrees, noting the Galaxy S24 FE would be a much more compelling option if the pricing dropped by a hundred or more bucks. </p><p>What are the reasons to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE instead? If you want to stick within the Galaxy smartphone universe, it’s the most affordable model in the new line. It is more durable than the Google Pixel 8a with a higher water- and dust-resistance rating. It also has a much larger screen, so if you prefer bigger over compact and would make use of the extra screen real estate, it might suit your needs better. </p><p>There’s also the bigger battery and the option for a 512GB variant that could sway your decision. Though considering the approximately $200 delta in price, when you look at the 512GB version, you could sign up for years of cloud storage with the savings. </p><p>If you aren’t interested in getting all the AI goodies and just want a solid yet affordable Samsung Galaxy phone, another option to consider is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Samsung Galaxy A series phone</a>. This mid-range line includes several popular models, including newly introduced ones, some of which sell for even under $200. If you go up the line, you can find a phone that’s comparable in price to the Google Pixel 8a that gets you into the Galaxy space without breaking the bank. Just note that many of these phones sport an Exynos processor as well and aren’t as feature-rich as the Galaxy S24 FE. </p><p>The only real reason to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is if you are adamant about sticking with Samsung and don’t want to fork over $1000+ for a flagship. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers the opportunity to get into the Samsung space for a mid-range price. We just wish it had kept the same Snapdragon processor and found another way to justify the price drop beyond swapping the processor.</p>

<p>If you really want to get a Samsung Galaxy device, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is a premium, new phone at a mid-range price. With seven years of updates, you can be assured it will last for some time. Plus, AI goodies mean it rivals its bigger sisters in that respect. The processor might not support future AI needs, however, so you’ll need to consider that in your decision. But it has a bigger screen and gets you into the S24 family for less.</p></p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Bluetooth has been around for over 25 years and it&apos;s still unreliable compared to Wi-Fi or even cellular. Unless I use matching equipment from Apple or Samsung I have nothing but problems with buffering and connection issues. Why is this still happening in 2024?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance</strong></em></p>
<p>Hiya! I understand your frustration and agree that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-headsets">Bluetooth</a> seems to have more issues than Wi-Fi and cellular (provided you have a good connection) <em>sometimes</em>. That&apos;s the key word here, sometimes. And for some people, in some places.</p><p>The short answer for people who aren&apos;t interested in going deeper: Bluetooth uses a heavily congested slice of frequency, depends on several different proprietary technologies, and different devices have different additions on top of it all.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the right (wrong) place at the right (wrong) time using the right (wrong) equipment, you&apos;re going to have a bad time. Otherwise, Bluetooth can be reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">and even great</a> — it is for millions of people.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is a bit like a layer cake. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-excited-about-android-15-audio-sharing-feature">base, bare-bones implementation</a> can be open-source and openly available using mostly open hardware, and that&apos;s great. But almost nobody uses it that way because it will be exactly what&apos;s described above — unreliable — most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RstMRJKVa8UK2UGF2PBXGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-vs-pro-close-05.jpg" alt="Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RstMRJKVa8UK2UGF2PBXGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Companies like Intel, Apple, Qualcomm, and other tech conglomerates have built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">useful additions</a> that make Bluetooth better, more reliable, and even faster on the same frequency because of improved compression. </p><p>If you buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone</a> and a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-airpods-good-earbud-choice-android-users">AirPods</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds</a>, you&apos;re probably going to have a great experience because both sides on the hardware front use the same software and have been built to work especially well with each other. </p>
<p>That doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t work well with other equipment. It just means that they have been designed to work best with each other. Other, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-true-wireless-earbuds">often inexpensive accessories and equipment</a>, may not have the same additions to Bluetooth and can&apos;t take advantage of higher output strength or better compression, and the experience isn&apos;t going to be the same.</p><p>Chances are it&apos;s still going to be good though, because the biggest issues with Bluetooth depend on the other equipment around you.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-getting-crowded-in-here-2">It&apos;s getting crowded in here</h2>
<p>Without getting into the numbers and buffers, or the intricacies of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance">CSMA/CA</a>, Bluetooth operates in the same "airspace" as 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and plenty of unregulated equipment. The channels in these frequencies are often crowded and when some of the devices make no effort to intelligently work with other equipment, it can be a mess.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm" name="amazonbasics-microwave-review-7.jpg" alt="AmazonBasics Microwave" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest offenders when it comes to Bluetooth network interference are (believe it or not) microwave ovens and old cordless landline telephones. Both emit signals (in the case of a microwave, it&apos;s a byproduct) in the 2.4GHz range and will interfere with both 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Microwaves are especially problematic because they do not know they are causing interference and simply do not care; hit the button to start them up, and they leak radio waves through old inefficient seals everywhere.</p><p>Bluetooth and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi also can interfere with each other, but that&apos;s where CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) comes into play. It&apos;s a network protocol that devices use to actively avoid interference and most of the time it does a good job.</p><p>When Bluetooth signals are faced with interference there can be audio buffering, connection issues, and connections dropping intermittently. There may not be anything you can do about it other than move somewhere else.</p>
<p>As older devices are phased out and old equipment is replaced with newer and more efficient equipment, the problem will "fix" itself.</p><p>These seemingly small problems can all add up to be the reason why Bluetooth is bad for one person while it&apos;s great for another. The equipment and your location are important pieces of the puzzle. Don&apos;t write off the technology because it obviously works well for millions of people, even if it works poorly for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re likely several months away from Google&apos;s next budget phone, but that&apos;s not stopping the leaks as they reignite previous speculations.</p><p>A collaboration between X tipster OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a">Android Headlines</a> brought about a series of leaked Pixel 9a renderings. There are a couple of standouts with these leaked renderings, such as its large bezels. It seems the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> will sport some rather striking bezels around its display, which features rounded corners.</p><p>Moreover, the renders offered a look at the back of the device and its surprising departure from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">the massive camera bar</a> we&apos;ve seen on the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>There&apos;s a subtle black outline around the supposed dual-camera array and an LED flash off to the side of it. When angled, the renders don&apos;t show a "bump." The Pixel 9a is rumored to do away with the bump, but it&apos;s unclear how/if this will affect the strength of its cameras. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> features a 64MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Google is suspected of continuing to offer a "boxy" design like the Pixel 9 series. The budget variant is rumored to offer flat sides, which these rumors show could take on a matte finish.</p><p>Rumors add the Pixel 9a could sport a 6.1-inch display like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">its predecessor</a> alongside an 8/128GB (RAM/storage) configuration. Additionally, the publication states the phone could pick up a battery that&apos;s "a tad larger" than the 4,492mAh in the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>Typically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">alleged real-life images</a> appear <em>after </em>the renderings, but that didn&apos;t happen this time. In late August, a set of images posted on Facebook supposedly showcased the Pixel 9a — and that staggering minimalistic camera array change. The camera bump shined in a close-up shot, giving us a detailed look at how flush it might be to the Pixel 9a&apos;s rear panel. The imagery continued to show glimpses at the SIM tray, USB-C port, and speaker grille at the bottom of the device.</p><p>Additional rumors from September suggested Google could pack a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">year-old piece of hardware</a> into the Pixel 9a. Supposedly, the phone could rock the older Exynos Modem 5300 instead of Samsung&apos;s recent 5400 version. Efficiency and cooling were listed among the aspects the device could miss <em>if </em>Google opts for older tech.</p><p>Moreover, the Pixel 9a could also see an odd change to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 SoC</a>. Rumors state the chip could see a "plastic packaging" change that could alter its heating/cooling capabilities. We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">seen this before with the Pixel 7a</a> as Google shifted toward the "worse" IPOP method instead of Samsung&apos;s proprietary FOPLP-PoP.</p><p>This thicker IPOP method could result in the Pixel 9a clinging to the heat its SoC produces, resulting in an overall hotter phone. These are all rumors, so we&apos;ll have to see which way Google&apos;s judgment swings once it&apos;s here.</p><p>The device could launch in Q2 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new set of rumors have surfaced regarding Qualcomm&apos;s next flagship SoC and it&apos;s singing a sour tune about next-gen pricing.</p><p>The rumors stem from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/OzlzReO2k">post on Weibo</a> by Digital Chat Station (DCS), which states the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 could rise sharply in price for OEMs (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8-gen-4-dimensity-9400-prices-leak-3486015/">Android Authority</a>). According to the tipster, Qualcomm&apos;s next chipset could see an estimated 20% price increase over last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>Nothing&apos;s set in stone, however, the tipster states Qualcomm&apos;s SoC price could jump to roughly $190.</p><p>What&apos;s more, DCS has seemingly edited their rumored post on Weibo — fortunately, there&apos;s still a screenshot of the missing addition teasing a potential price increase from MediaTek. Supposedly, the upcoming Dimensity 9400 SoC could see a similar 20% price increase for a possible $155 toll on OEMs.</p><p>DCS states these prices are purely estimations and could shift (negatively or positively) as the year progresses. Either way, next-gen phones preparing to arrive with the SD 8 Gen 4 or the Dimensity 9400 are in for a pricing change. The tipster attributed the speculated price increase to the 3nm process, stating it&apos;s "quite expensive."</p>

<p>A highlight of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is the existence of new, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">beefed-up Oryon CPUs</a>. The company&apos;s chief marketing officer, Don McGuire detailed this new CPU during MWC 2024, stating the custom cores would be paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80 5G </a>Modem-RF system. Consumers and OEMs can expect 5G capabilities alongside satellite communication support.</p><p>The chip is rumored to hit 4.0GHz and grab the Adreno 830 as its graphics partner.</p><p>A price hike isn&apos;t surprising with all of this packed into the SoC. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">Qualcomm&apos;s SVP Chris Patrick stated</a> last October that the company was aiming for "astonishing levels of performance" with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. Moreover, designing the chip with custom cores isn&apos;t cheap, but Patrick seemingly alluded to a "balance" between power, performance, and price.</p><p>With rumors doubling down on Patrick&apos;s confirmation, perhaps we&apos;ll need to brace for an impending price hike. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/expensive-smartphones-2025-xiaomi-3475935/">Android Authority</a> also cited comments from Xiaomi, stating its phones may become more expensive due to flagship SoCs becoming more expensive. The company was reportedly seeking aid from the public about how it should handle this moving forward.</p><p>Elsewhere, MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9400-cores-rumor">Dimensity 9400 is rumored</a> to feature Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores alongside some impressive benchmark scores.</p>

<ul><li>Verizon customers have been experiencing issues for most of the morning. </li><li>Currently, more than 100,000 outage reports have been filed with DownDetector.</li><li>Verizon is aware of the outage, but has yet to provide any indication of when it will be resolved.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting around 10 am ET, Verizon subscribers began reporting outages via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/">Downdetector</a>. It appears that affected users are unable to send texts, or make or receive phone calls, along with seeing their devices showing "Emergency Calls Only." </p><p>Some took to social media to see if others were experiencing the same problems. According to Downdetector, the majority of the outage seems to be affecting those on the East Coast, including Washington D.C. and New York. However, the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/">heatmap</a>" also shows issues in other regions of the country, extending out to the West Coast.</p>

<p>Although customers began reporting these problems at around 10 am, Verizon finally acknowledged the "issue" almost two hours later. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are aware of an issue impacting service for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and we are working quickly to identify and solve the issue.<a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonNews/status/1840780785084985777">September 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>At the time of this writing, Verizon has not yet provided an update as to when we can expect the problems to be resolved. Additionally, while there were reports of similar problems with AT&T and T-Mobile customers, the former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1840789134757028036">shared</a> that it is "not experiencing a nationwide outage. Our national network is operating normally. Down Detector is likely reflecting challenges our customers are having attempting to connect to users on another network."</p>

<h2 id="how-long-can-the-pixel-buds-pro-2-apos-s-battery-last-2">How long can the Pixel Buds Pro 2&apos;s battery last?</h2>
<p>Google presented the first model of the Pixel Buds in 2022, and now you can enjoy the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. But how long they last depends on what you do and don&apos;t do with them. Google promises that you get up to 1.5 hours of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation off, and you only need a five-minute charge for it. They are the first model to have a Google Tensor chip to power features such as Clear Calling and improve the battery life.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">In his testing, Android Central&apos;s Tshaka Armstrong mentions</a> that after wearing the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for eight hours with mixed-use, switching between ANC and transparency, listening to music, or just having them in his ears, he had 40% battery left at the end of the day. During his testing, he also discovered that while sitting at his desk, an hour of ANC used at 50% of max volume used roughly 20% of the battery in the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">earbud</a> and 10% in the left.</p><p>Google claims up to eight hours of listening time with ANC, but that leaves you with only 50% on the left side. Tshaka will do more testing in the future to get more numbers for real-world use since that doesn&apos;t add up.</p><p>The battery life for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is better than the original model since you get one more hour of listening time and 10 hours more of total listening time with the charging case with Active Noise Cancellation on. With it off, you get one more hour of listening time and 17 more hours of total listening time with the charging case.</p><p>Google also promises up to five hours of listening time with the charging case and up to 24 hours of listening time with the buds. If you&apos;re happy with the battery stats, the only thing left is to decide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/what-color-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-should-you-buy">what color Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 you should buy</a>. You can choose from four great colors and listen to your favorite music while looking great.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-drain-your-earbuds-battery-faster-2">What can drain your earbuds battery faster?</h2>
<p>Everyone wants their earbuds&apos; battery to last as long as possible. However, some standard practices, such as listening to music at a high volume or with a lot of bass, can quickly drain the battery. So, the higher the volume, the more load you put on the battery.</p><p>You can also turn off extra settings, protect them from extreme temperatures, and keep them out of direct sunlight. If you drop the earbuds, that can also damage them, resulting in a faster battery discharge. So, whether you&apos;re using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> or not, taking care of your earbuds is a must.</p>

Unfortunately, it&apos;s not quite there, despite Google inflating the price by $100 to match some other competitors, but it gets close, offering plenty of fun AI features that users are sure to love (or ignore).</p><p>So what&apos;s new with the Pixel 9, how is it different from its Pro siblings, and is it worth getting over the cheaper Pixel 8 or the more expensive Pixel 9 Pro? Last year&apos;s phone was priced well at just $699, but has Google justified the price increase of its latest model?</p><p>After spending some time with the Pixel 9, I can confidently say that this is a very good phone, with enough power and good enough cameras to get the job done. The Pixel 9 may not be the most powerful phone out there, but it is good at what it does, and that should be enough for most people. And what&apos;s great is that you don&apos;t even need to pay for a subscription to experience some of its best AI features.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-11.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDtA2xuQDU4ADb44YoMAQD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> looks quite different from its predecessor, but many of the main design cues are still there. Notably, the camera visor is no longer connected to the device&apos;s frame; it&apos;s now a floating camera bar with an all-aluminum side and a rounded cutout for the dual camera system. In fact, the shape of the camera bar reminds me of the Pixel&apos;s rather large and bubbly Quick Settings button, which brings an unexpected level of cohesion.</p><p>One thing I was concerned about regarding the new Pixel 9 design was the new flat design, particularly the frame. After using phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, I&apos;ve become a bit weary of sharp edges as they tend not to play nice with my poor finger when handling the phones one-handed. Fortunately, that&apos;s not the case here, as the satin metal frame is surprisingly soft, and Google gave it a very slight curve where the frame meets the front and rear panels, which keeps the phone from digging into your pinky finger.</p>

<p>I do agree with Android Central&apos;s Phones editor, Nick Sutrich, who said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a> the new design reminds him of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">the latest iPhones</a>, at least if you look at it from the front and the sides. In fact, whenever I use the Pixel 9 out and about, friends would comment on how similar it looks to an iPhone, even when looking at it from the back. They could go so far as to say Google "stole" the design, which I think is going a bit far, but the resemblance is a bit uncanny.</p><p>The phone is surprisingly comfortable to hold. Beyond its soft frame and somewhat slick glass panels, the phone is still fairly small despite being a couple of millimeters larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Given its size, I wouldn&apos;t exactly put this among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small Android phones</a>, but the 6.3-inch OLED panel is handled well thanks to the minimal and uniform bezels. My only complaint is that despite not having the smallest bezels I&apos;ve dealt with, I find my finger accidentally activating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> pretty often. It&apos;s not a huge annoyance, but something to point out if you enable the feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="jkze5rZPEMXW5dH5W2aK9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Casefity-clear.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 in a clear Casetify case with a MagSafe ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jkze5rZPEMXW5dH5W2aK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2302" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would also suggest investing in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Pixel 9 case</a>. As nice as it is to feel your phone in its natural, naked state, this phone is just too slippery for its own good. There have been several times when I&apos;ve set it down on a surface, only to hear it fall onto the ground a mere minutes later. Fortunately, the aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 make the phone pretty tough, but I would rather not risk it any more than I should.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-display"><span>Google Pixel 9: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-20.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFcrajSuHh2pA2Mx3EkwtN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OLED display looks great, and while I normally leave phones on Natural color mode, the Adaptive display mode doesn&apos;t overly saturate colors as I find on other phones. You will have to remember to turn on Smooth display to kick up to the 120Hz refresh rate, but once you do, it&apos;s smooth sailing.</p><p>The added brightness also means that viewing content outdoors should be no problem. Just make sure to slap on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-screen-protectors" target="_blank">Pixel 9 screen protector</a>, as I&apos;ve already noticed some very light scratches across the display on my unit. These scratches aren&apos;t really noticeable until I view it with the display off from a certain angle (but they&apos;re still enough to annoy me).</p><p>I also have no complaints so far about the new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which feels fast and accurate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-14.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcMYegdn3J5Sf9ybyfyWrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> sports the same size display, it comes with a higher QHD+ resolution. However, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll miss it on this phone, which is only a FHD+ panel. Everything still appears sharp and content looks great. Would a higher resolution have been nice? Perhaps, but at this size, it doesn&apos;t really matter much, and the slightly smaller and just as costly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> has the same resolution.</p>
<p>Yet, while I find the display to be quite nice, others may not fare as well. Google still keeps the display at a particularly low PWM rate, meaning people that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> may find it difficult to use the display.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ggwFJcL9mzCb2t6zL8HCqN" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-03.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggwFJcL9mzCb2t6zL8HCqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chipset isn&apos;t a huge upgrade over its predecessor, but that matters very little here. Coupled with 12GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 performs quite well when opening and juggling apps. I think most people buying this phone will be pleased with its performance, especially when it comes to AI tasks. I also haven&apos;t noticed the phone getting too warm when playing games like Honkai: Star Rail or Fall Guys, which is a good sign to me, although touch input does seem ever-so-slightly delayed at times.</p>

<p>The phone has pretty decent haptics and good audio, which doesn&apos;t surprise me. The dual stereo speakers sound very full, with plenty of depth and good bass response, while the haptics remain quite subtle when navigating the phone or when receiving notifications.</p><p>Storage is also a problem for the Pixel 9. The base model comes with just 128GB, which just seems small for a flagship phone in 2024. As such, after setting up the Pixel and moving apps and audio over from my daily driver, the Pixel told me I had used 90% of my available storage. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-still-cant-get-the-basics-right-on-pixels">pointed out</a> by Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> that have double this amount of storage, so the fact that the three Pixel 9 series phones start with 128GB is a bit ridiculous.</p><p>The Pixel 9 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and Bluetooth 5.3, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">I personally don&apos;t own a Wi-Fi 7 router</a> and probably won&apos;t for some time, it&apos;s nice to see it here. I&apos;m also hoping we&apos;ll get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">proper Auracast support</a> soon, hopefully after Android 15 rolls around.</p><p>I am sad to see the lack of UWB support, meaning you can&apos;t take advantage of more powerful location-tracking features or digital car key functionality. Whether it&apos;s truly necessary remains to be seen, but it&apos;s one of the things setting this phone apart from its Pro siblings.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-battery-life-and-charging"><span>Google Pixel 9: Battery life and charging</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mdjwk9zUDLj8BpV4L2ZGwX" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-16.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 battery life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdjwk9zUDLj8BpV4L2ZGwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I&apos;ve been quite impressed with the battery life so far. The phone easily lasts me until the end of the day, and I get around seven or eight hours of screen time, which is pretty good. Google claims 24+ battery life and even longer with Energy Saver (since that&apos;s kind of how it works), and while I haven&apos;t gotten more than a day of battery life, I imagine it will vary based on your usage.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are other aspects of the battery that I&apos;m less impressed by. The 27W charging is almost unbearably slow, which is something that has always annoyed me about Pixel phones. Unlike the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which charged up to 70% in just 30 minutes, the Pixel 9 takes the same amount of time to just reach 50%, although those figures are based on a 45W Google charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="exhBULrSUFiKmvkxr7f8pU" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-15.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exhBULrSUFiKmvkxr7f8pU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don&apos;t have a Google 45W charger, and my experience has been quite different, with the phone taking a bit longer to reach 50% and then having to wait another hour to get to full when using a 100W charger from Anker. Fortunately, 50% still lasts you a good amount of the day, but wired and wireless charging speeds fall behind many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> with fast charging capabilities.</p><p>You also won&apos;t find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Qi2 wireless charging</a>. This isn&apos;t the end of the world, but with the popularity of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe cases for Android phones</a>, it&apos;s surprising to see Google skip out on the standard that people clearly want when it&apos;s been available for some time now.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-cameras"><span>Google Pixel 9: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4231px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-04.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 camera app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TXmJfVXGYaC89kvK8erVU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4231" height="2380" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m normally quite impressed with Pixel cameras, and while images captured from the Pixel 9 aren&apos;t bad, they&apos;re not particularly remarkable to me. Images are detailed and crisp, and there&apos;s a great deal of dynamic range, even in lower lighting conditions.</p><p>That said, I do find that images sometimes lack that extra punch of vibrancy or saturation that I like, and as a result, sometimes photos can appear a bit dull. I&apos;ve also seen instances where the sky might get blown out, but this doesn&apos;t happen too often. Otherwise, images have nice natural bokeh, and Macro Focus takes it to another level by letting you get really close.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pixel 9 still lacks a third rear camera. This becomes particularly clear when compared to the Galaxy S24, which is also priced at $799 and sports a third lens for 3x telephoto images. Sure, the Pixel takes pretty good images with up to 8x Super Res Zoom, but the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera limits the zoom capabilities when compared to the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been comparing the camera to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which has been my main driver for the past couple of months. To my surprise, I find that I often prefer the Razr Plus over the Pixel 9, which is something I never thought I&apos;d say. Images from the Razr just have that extra bit of vibrancy that I like in images, even if the Pixel often brings more depth to photos. I also find that post-processing on the Pixel tends to make photos look a bit artificial, while the Razr tends to keep things a bit more natural, even with lighting.</p>

<p>Still, the added dynamic range on the Pixel 9 can help make certain details stand out better than they would on the Razr Plus 2024, which isn&apos;t as consistent on this front. The Razr also falls behind on low-light images, whereas the Pixel 9 retains plenty of detail.</p><p>The two phones sometimes trade blows depending on the lighting conditions, and I prefer many Razr images over the Pixel. That said, while Motorola has clearly put in some work to improve its foldable camera, the Pixel is much more consistent overall in its shots.</p>

<p>One cool feature I like to show off is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a>, which lets the person taking a photo add themselves to the image after it&apos;s been taken. It&apos;s a very neat feature, and I&apos;ve seen some excellent examples that make it look pretty convincing that everyone was in the photo.</p><p>My example (below) is admittedly a bit different from what Google had in mind, and at first glance, it looks fine until you squint and realize something&apos;s off. The result isn&apos;t perfect, but capturing yourself twice in the same frame is a very cool effect that I wouldn&apos;t be able to replicate easily using photo editing applications.</p><p>For a more traditional use of Add Me, Nick Sutrich has seen a result from the feature with him and his family, and you can check it out on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro review</a>. It&apos;s a much better example, but even then, it takes a squint to realize something&apos;s off and that someone has essentially been added to the photo. Still, it&apos;s a very cool feature that I think many would find useful when the moment calls for it.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the Pixel 9 is still running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> as Google prepares to roll out stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its devices and others. It&apos;s a little odd that it didn&apos;t launch with the update, but it&apos;s not a huge deal. After all, Google was able to include plenty of new features on its Pixel 9 phones that we will likely see come to older Pixels down the road. The company is also extending its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven-year update promise</a> to the Pixel 9, which is good to see, even if you don&apos;t plan to keep the phone for that long.</p><p>The Pixel 9 supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> with Multimodality, meaning it can handle some pretty complicated stuff. I&apos;ve played around with a few of the new AI features, and so far, I&apos;m pretty impressed. Among them, Pixel Studio is probably my favorite new app. It&apos;s a text-to-image generator powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-need-to-try-googles-imagefx-ai-image-generator">Google&apos;s new Imagen 3 model</a>. It&apos;s pretty easy to use, allowing you to go into existing images available in the studio or to create your own from scratch.</p><p>The results are pretty damn impressive, and more often than not, they put a smile on my face. The app does quite well in generating clear, high-quality images, and the results can be spot-on, including how the app generates text like book or movie titles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mG4yaFLY9kVVaDcBFVVTNG" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-17.jpg" alt="Pixel Studio app on the Google Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mG4yaFLY9kVVaDcBFVVTNG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> also has some interesting new features, like Reimagine, which lets you change aspects of a photo in your gallery by typing a prompt. You can pretty much completely transform an image with surprisingly good detail. The results may not be completely perfect, but the feature feels more versatile and capable than what I&apos;ve seen with Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.29%;"><img id="YoStouq6mrgZkmCmfj3MX5" name="Magic-Editor-Reimagine-example-waterfall-lava-pool.jpg" alt="An image reimagined with a waterfall and a pool of molten lava" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoStouq6mrgZkmCmfj3MX5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I reimagined this photo with a free-flowing waterfall and a pool of lava. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, there have been some examples of both Pixel Studio and Reimagine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-not-the-only-way-to-create-unhinged-ai-photos">generating some unfavorable things.</a> However, Google is continuing to gain feedback and adjust things accordingly, so we should see much less of that when using these features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> is a useful way to record and transcribe calls, and it not only lets you replay the recording or search through the transcription, but the feature also summarizes the details of the call, in case you just need to remember what the gist of the conversation was.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Pixel Weather, which is a beautiful app that provides AI-generated reports of the rest of your day and what you can expect the following day, complete with weather animations. It does a decent job of covering the basic points of the forecast without overloading you with information, although I can see how some people would want even more detail. That said, I&apos;m not sure how useful the AI-generated reports are, as their main purpose seems to be to summarize the information already presented to you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nWBmaJnqaCTwXrBXQntggk" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-26.jpg" alt="The Pixel Weather app on the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nWBmaJnqaCTwXrBXQntggk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of usefulness, I still can&apos;t find a reason to actually use the Pixel Screenshots app, as it&apos;s simply just a way to search screenshots and create AI summaries of them. My thing is that most of the screenshots I take are of funny memes or photos that I find interesting or need for work (which are used immediately), and it&apos;s rarely anything that I ever need to recall. I&apos;m sure some people will find it useful, and I may end up changing my mind as I continue testing the phone, but right now, it just feels a bit superfluous.</p><p>I will say that I&apos;m coming around to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, although I also haven&apos;t found much use for it beyond having fairly mundane or asinine conversations. It actually sounds surprisingly natural in its responses and appears to understand my queries well, even if they&apos;re multilayered or if I&apos;m seemingly rambling a bit. I asked for some diet tips to achieve my goal weight, and it provided some sound advice. I then followed up by asking for exercises that could help, and it gave equally sound advice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-24.jpg" alt="Gemini Live UI on the Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbE7NDe2Rut6zCprCEjsVE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, Gemini Live couldn&apos;t remember the weight goal I gave it just a day prior, so I had to remind it during follow-up queries. Basically, I can see this being a useful feature occasionally when you have very specific and multi-layered questions, but I already don&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> very much, so I&apos;m not sure how much I would use Gemini or Gemini Live on a regular basis.</p><p>On the plus side, Gemini Live is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">no longer tied to Gemini Advanced</a> (which is locked behind a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscription). That means you can try it yourself to see just how useful it can be for you. Plus, the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini assistant</a> continues to gain more functionality, making it a more viable replacement for Google Assistant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3994px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nEak9zPJYRAV3TWUPKyrNg" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-23.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEak9zPJYRAV3TWUPKyrNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3994" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Google limits the Pixel 9 compared to its Pro siblings, and it&apos;s not clear why. Despite sporting the same Tensor G4 chip and 12GB of RAM, enough to handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, Google has omitted certain camera features from the base Pixel 9, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a>, Pro Controls, High-Res photos, and more.</p><p>When asked why there&apos;s such a feature disparity, Google couldn&apos;t provide a clear answer, making it seem as though it&apos;s just gatekeeping features for its more expensive phones. It&apos;s a bit unfortunate since I don&apos;t think Samsung does the same thing with the base Galaxy S24, and that only has 8GB of RAM.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-the-competition"><span>Google Pixel 9: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the base Pixel 9 model, there are a few other phones you can consider at or below this price point from companies like Samsung and OnePlus.</p><p>The base Galaxy S24 is the closest competitor to the Pixel 9, offering a similarly small, mostly flat chassis and comparable specs. One major difference is the presence of a telephoto camera, something the Pixel 9 lacks. On the other hand, the Pixel 9 comes with 12GB of RAM, which should make it more capable when it comes to on-device AI processing. It also has a larger battery, which should theoretically help it last longer on a single charge. Otherwise, both offer similar software promises and great camera quality for the same price.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is another similarly priced option for anyone looking for a flagship. As far as specs go, the phone bests the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S24 in many areas, sporting a larger battery, much faster charging, and up to 16GB of RAM. The downside to getting a OnePlus is that the software isn&apos;t for everyone, and support isn&apos;t as robust. The phone also isn&apos;t as water resistant, so you can&apos;t submerge it.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a new Google flagship without spending $1000.</li><li>You want the latest AI features on your phone before anyone else.</li><li>You want some of the best cameras on the market.</li></ul>

<ul><li>You own a Pixel 8.</li><li>You want a phone with fast charging capabilities.</li><li>You want a phone with a telephoto camera and Pro camera controls.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;ve never been a big fan of Pixel phones, but after using the Pixel 9 for a month, I think that it&apos;s a great phone that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-pixel-9-or-pixel-9-pro">you should consider purchasing for your next upgrade</a>, especially if you&apos;re not trying to drop $1000 on a Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Tensor G4 may not be the most powerful chip on the market, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">it&apos;s perfect for the Pixel</a> and how Google is positioning this phone, especially when paired with 12GB of RAM. Its performance is great, battery life is great, and you won&apos;t be disappointed by its cameras unless you&apos;re hoping for a telephoto lens with strong zoom capabilities.</p><p>Yes, the Pixel 9 still doesn&apos;t get all the features you&apos;ll find on the Pro phones, and that&apos;s a problem. If you think you would want some of those missing features, then you <em>should</em> spring for the Pro phones. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 is still a good phone if you can stomach the $100 premium over its predecessor.</p>
