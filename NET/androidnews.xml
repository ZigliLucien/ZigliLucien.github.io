                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Black Friday/Cyber Monday festivities have officially come to a close, but you might be surprised at the number of great smartwatch deals still hanging around. For example, I was shocked to see that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6"><strong>Amazon is </strong><em><strong>still </strong></em><strong>carving 53% off the Galaxy Watch 6 following the major sale event,</strong></a> a leftover deal that drops the beloved Samsung watch to its lowest price EVER. As of writing, the retailer is claiming to have only 20 of these watches left in stock, so I would act fast if you&apos;re interested. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><em><strong>Samsung's Cyber Week sale is LIVE — see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>Despite being a last-gen wearable, the Galaxy Watch 6 continues to impress as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> around, thanks to its sophisticated blend of sleek design choices, snappy Exynos performance, and loads of RAM. It even has a lot of the same hardware and display tech as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, Samsung&apos;s latest smartwatch.</p><p>If we were talking about full price here, I&apos;d say go with the newer model — but pair the Galaxy Watch 6 with a $139.99 price tag? That&apos;s an amazing deal, just in time for the holidays.</p>

<p>Amazon has extended a Cyber Monday deal that carves an incredible 53% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</a>, one of the best smartwatches that the OEM has ever produced. This discount is only available for the Black variety of the watch. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Pixel Troubleshooting update gets new Device Temperature check feature.</li><li>It allows Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 users to check their device temperatures whenever their devices seem warm to touch.</li><li>The temperature check feature involves relevant color schemes to accurately represent the device's condition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Pixel phones might have a nifty new feature that lets users identify how hot their devices are running directly from their handsets' battery settings.</p><p>Google has apparently released a Pixel Troubleshooting app update for its devices, ranging from Pixel 6 to the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>, notes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/02/pixel-9-temperature-troubleshooting/">9to5Google</a>. The latest update brings a new "Device temperature" feature, which can be seen in the Battery section of the device Settings.</p>

<p>It sits under the battery diagnostics' "Phone is very warm" section, which earlier showcased settings that keep the device battery optimized. Another way to access the new page is to directly search for "Device temperature" through the Settings app.</p><p>Under the Device temperature, users can now find four relevant colors, evidently dubbed Cold, Normal, Warm, and Elevated, indicating the current temperature state of the device.</p>
<p>The new page further indicates that the projected device temperature is according to various internal sensors that the aforementioned Pixel phones already ship with. 9to5 further notes that users can also witness other tips like "To cool down your phone, provide airflow to your phone if possible" and "Use only cases or covers made for your specific phone," among others.</p><p>The live device temperature is being rolled out via the Pixel Troubleshooting app bearing the <strong>1.0.693922709</strong> version. Pixel phones include the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and the Pixel 9 series. It has not yet been rolled out to Pixel Tablet. As 9to5 notes, the update was seen running on the devices mentioned above, running on stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">recently rolled out</a> to all compatible Pixel phones.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Pixel Troubleshooting app was introduced last year, and the Pixel 8 was one of the first handsets to receive the feature. It helps users diagnose their battery and network issues, and the new temperature feature is indeed a valuable addition as it eliminates the need for installing third-party apps or devices to measure the device's temperature.</p>

<ul><li>Google shared that it managed to double Chrome's score in Speedometer 2.1, a browser benchmark, on Android devices.</li><li>The feat was achieved by optimizing Chrome for more premium devices and advanced Arm architectures, like Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>Google says these improvements will be noticeable in daily use, while doing things like loading a Google Doc on the Pixel Tablet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If the Google Chrome on Android feels faster lately, especially on more premium Android phones and tablets, it's not just you. Google says that Chrome for Android experienced significant increases in scores and overall performance in a popular browser benchmark Speedometer 2.1, since Chrome version M112 released last year. Now that Speedometer 3.0 is out, Google is reporting that devices with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset are crushing the new benchmark, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/12/doubling-speedometer-scores-android.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>From version M122 to the current version M129, Google is seeing Speedometer scores more than double on many Android devices. That's due to build optimizations, improvements to the JavaScript engine and rendering engine, and optimization for OS versions and systems-on-a-chips (SoCs).</p><p>The improvements began with Chrome M113, when Google introduced a new version of Chrome for Android. For the first time, there was a separate build of Chrome available for high-end devices that maximized their performance capabilities. Google says that creating separate builds for high and low-performance devices allowed it to better optimize for flagship chips. For example, it built the new, high-performance build of Chrome for Arm64, making use of the efficiency of Arm's 64-bit instruction set.</p><p>You can see these improvements when Chrome is paired with the latest silicon, such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the first to use custom Oryon cores for mobile. In the Speedometer 3.0 benchmark shared by Google below, the difference between the same browser's performance on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 versus Snapdragon 8 Elite is stark.</p>

<p>Google thinks these improvements will translate to daily use of Chrome on high-end Android phones and tablets, too. In the below test, provided by Google, Chrome M129 on the Pixel Tablet loaded a Google Doc webpage 50% faster than the older M112 version on the same device.</p>

<p>The new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip specifically resulted in a 60% to 80% improvement in Speedometer 3.0 improvement, and Google says it tweaked Chrome's builds and engines to ensure that the browser wasn't bottlenecking the chip's performance.</p><p>As more phones are released with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, more people will be able to try out the faster version of Chrome for themselves.

<ul><li>The last stage of Samsung’s One UI 6 Watch rollout appears to be underway, with users in Korea seeing the update become available for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.</li><li>The move comes as Samsung has updated the Galaxy Watch 6 series, Galaxy Watch 5 series, and Galaxy Watch FE to Wear OS 5 in recent days and weeks.</li><li>The updates, beginning abroad, will eventually come to the US and North America at a later date.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reaching the final stage of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-begins-rolling-out-one-ui-6-watch-for-older-galaxy-watch-models">lengthy One UI 6 Watch rollout</a>, which brings Wear OS 5 to all the company’s Wear OS smartwatches. As of today, users in Korea started seeing the One UI 6 Watch update become available for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%94-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%98-%EB%B2%84%EC%A6%88-%EA%B8%B0%ED%83%80/galaxy-watch-4-one-ui-6-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%9E%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/30461217" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung’s community forums. The update is currently available for only the Bluetooth models of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 series</a>, and only in Korea — for now.</p><p>The company launched One UI 6 Watch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and Galaxy Watch 7, released in July. It made its way to the Galaxy Watch 6 series late last month. Just yesterday, Dec. 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os-5-is-now-rolling-out-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-5-and-watch-fe-models">Samsung brought the Wear OS 5 upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 5 series and the Galaxy Watch FE</a>.</p><p>That means all of Samsung’s Wear OS watches, from the oldest Galaxy Watch 4 to the cheapest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, are beginning to get the boost to One UI 6 Watch. As is typically the case, Bluetooth models of the Galaxy Watch will receive the upgrade in a few regions to start. Then, over the coming days and weeks, LTE-equipped models will become eligible to upgrade, and it’ll arrive in more regions. North American units are often towards the end of the line when it comes to receiving One UI 6 Watch upgrades.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LHF46EhLFdXuLW2sh2vj4" name="samsung-galaxy-ai-energy-score.JPG" alt="Galaxy AI energy score mock-up for One UI 6 Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LHF46EhLFdXuLW2sh2vj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A core part of the One UI 6 Watch update are health-related feature additions. Samsung is banking on the combination of Samsung Health and Galaxy AI, aiming to use it to help wearers improve their fitness and health. Energy Score is like Samsung’s rendition of Garmin’s Body Battery, and Sleep Analysis aims to let you know how well you slept. These features were exclusive to newer Galaxy Watch models at first, but are making their way to older ones now.</p><p>Samsung initially promised up to four years of software updates for the Galaxy Watch 4, which isn’t much of a concrete guarantee. However, it appears that old smartwatch may be nearing the end of its software support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-wear-os-5-1-preview-is-now-available-and-its-based-on-android-15">Wear OS 5.1</a> looks like a minor update, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, so the chances of the Galaxy Watch 4 making it to the eventual Wear OS 6 are slim.</p><p>Still, the first-generation of any product line typically receives poor software support, but that hasn’t been the case with the Galaxy Watch 4 (which is a first-gen product in the sense that it was Samsung’s first Wear OS watch). It’s had a great run with software upgrades, starting with Wear OS 3 and now supporting Wear OS 5.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted working on a new "clear voice" feature for the Recorder app.</li><li>Discoveries within the app's code suggest this feature will weed out annoying "background noises" to reduce their presence and elevate your voice.</li><li>The Recorder app, with Gemini Nano's help, brought a "summarize" function to the Pixel 8 and the app arrived on Chromebooks in November.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted preparing an update for its Recorder app that works harder to keep you clear.</p><p>During an APK teardown by X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-recorder-app-clear-voice-3505186/">Android Authority</a>), it was discovered that the company is working on a "clear voice" feature for the app. From the code, it seems that the primary function of the feature is to "reduce background noise."</p><p>Another string states the app will implement a filter to keep "human speech" while tossing "background sounds."</p><p>The post states the feature wasn't working properly through the early preview in v4.2.20241001.7 of the Recorder app. However, the tipster was able to uncover some advisories about using "clear voice." Within the code, Google features strings that state users cannot use the feature if their phone is in "stereo mode."</p><p>Additionally, the feature does not support the use of an external microphone.</p><p>Once this rolls out, users with the Recorder app must shift their phone into "mono audio" to use the background noise reduction magic. Most of the goodies seem in place, but it's not clear when Google will push this to Pixels.</p>

<p>The Recorder app has been relatively quiet in terms of updates; however, some standouts include its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-recorder-update-transcribe-again">major translation update</a>. Pixel devices can leverage a "Transcribe again" tool that leans on Google's Cloud services. In short, this feature re-transcribes a recording in one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9516618#zippy=%2Ctranscribe-a-recording-again">42 available languages</a>. The process sends your audio recording into the cloud to work its magic before returning it to you.</p><p>Our testing showed that the process takes a few minutes as the file travels.</p><p>More recently, the Recorder app was busy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">new goodies in new places</a>, like the Pixel 8. After the series picked up Gemini Nano, the Recorder app activated its "Summarize" feature for audio files. Leveraging Google's LLM (large language model), users can find a convenient summary of what transpired without listening to a lengthy audio log.</p><p>What's more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">ChromeOS 130 for Chromebooks</a> and Chromebook Plus models picked up a version of the app. Users were granted access to speech-to-text generation, summarization, and title suggestions.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Watch 3 has the chance to be one of the best Android watches we've seen, pushing Samsung and Google out of their comfort zone. But only if it resolves the flaws of the OnePlus Watch 2.</p><p>A leaker has suggested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-upcoming-global-launch-rumors">OnePlus Watch 3 will arrive next month</a> alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R, both officially confirmed to launch in January 2025. The Watch 2 arrived in March 2024, but perhaps OnePlus wants to align its flagship phone and watch launches for better sales and bundles.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> was the company's first Wear OS watch, and it stunned us with its multi-day battery life, fast performance, and attractive steel design. It also had fundamental issues with software and health accuracy, and other complaints about its size and missing features.</p><p>I polled our two OnePlus Watch 2 reviewers, Harish Jonnalaggadda and Nick Sutrich, while using my experience reviewing the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, to come up with a comprehensive list of everything we want from the OnePlus Watch 3!</p>
<h2 id="two-sizes-and-a-working-crown-2">Two sizes and a working crown</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9" name="oneplus-watch-2-9.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBzqRwhzSP4toKXDMtUob9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the OnePlus Watch 2 and 2R shipped in one fairly large size, with a 1.43-inch AMOLED display that matches the 1.43-inch, 45mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and falls slightly short of the 1.5-inch, 44mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. Unlike both of those watches, it has a 47mm, classic-style case that's large and heavy by any standard — about 80g with the strap.</p><p>Also unlike Google and Samsung, OnePlus only sold that one size option. Harish, who liked the Watch 2's overall look but not its "sizeable bezel" and "bulky" feel, says a smaller Watch 3 is his main request.</p><p>Our first hope for the OnePlus Watch 3 is that it sells a smaller option, most likely a 43mm case with a 1.25- or 1.3-inch display, that still retains a large battery capacity and its MIL-STD-810H-grade steel design.</p><p>Our second hope is that the Watch 3 has a <em>working</em> crown. The Watch 2's top-right crown button was "purely for aesthetics," as you could press to select but not scroll. Some Wear OS functions are annoying to swipe through, which is why Google and Samsung use a crown and digital bezel; let's hope OnePlus gets with the program.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-5-notification-fixes-and-backups-2">Wear OS 5, notification fixes, and backups</h2>
<p>The OnePlus Watch 2 launched with Wear OS 4 and has two promised version updates, so we expect Wear OS 5 on the Watch 3 at launch. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign">Wear OS watches are plagued by slow updates</a>, and brands other than Google and Samsung have typically trailed a year behind them for version updates. So we're crossing our fingers that OnePlus keeps pace and we don't have to wait for OS 5.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> added screen size optimization, reflowing text to fit smaller or larger screens, which would help OnePlus sell a new petite display option. It also added battery optimizations that would make the Watch 3 even <em>more</em> long-lived, plus various fitness tools for more dynamic workouts.</p><p>But OnePlus will have its own spinoff of Wear OS 5, with unique perks and downsides. Case in point, its version of Wear OS 4 doesn't support easy watch backups or transfers to your next Android phone, forcing you to scan a QR code just to transfer your health data. We'd want OnePlus to catch up on this front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ad3CoyWgGAjErJpWiFALDQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-11.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 notifications" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ad3CoyWgGAjErJpWiFALDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus uses a unique dual-OS system for its watches, with Wear OS for the main tasks and low-powered, proprietary RTOS running low-powered tasks on the coprocessor. This system is the secret to its 4-day battery life, but it also gave several of us consistent problems with ghost notifications never making it from phone to watch.</p><p>To be fair to OnePlus, we've also seen reports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ghost-vibrations-user-reports">ghost notifications on the Galaxy Watch 7</a>. But OnePlus especially seems to struggle with the issue, and we'd like to see that resolved or reduced by the OnePlus Watch 3 launch.</p><p>Samsung gives its Galaxy Watches unique perks for Samsung phone owners (AI insights, AFib readings, and sleep apnea detection); the same goes for Google and Pixel owners (Pixel call screening, synced watch-phone recordings, Ultra Wideband phone unlock). OnePlus phones dominate our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list, and we'd love to see OnePlus phone owners have unique Wear OS perks of their own to enjoy.</p>

<p>One of our biggest complaints with the OnePlus Watch 2 was with health and activity monitoring. Our reviewer Harish found that it had inconsistent step counts, "hilariously bad" stress data, and bad sleep-stage proportions. And Nick, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-vs-pixel-watch-2-one-week-challenge">wore the OnePlus Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 2 for a week</a>, found that OnePlus struggled to accurately capture higher heart rates during his workouts.</p><p>Interestingly, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-fitness-test">I tested the OnePlus Watch 2R's accuracy</a>, it did far better than expected. It wasn't as good as my Garmin watch and its average HR was usually 1–2 bpm below the correct levels, but it was surprisingly decent for step count and good enough for distance thanks to its dual-band GPS.</p><p>Our hope is that whatever behind-the-scenes tweaks OnePlus gave the Watch 2R will be applied to the Watch 3, and it won't be quite so useless when it comes to your workout data. But that's just the start of what OnePlus needs to do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CRunS2KLPNbHnYmoMCwryQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRunS2KLPNbHnYmoMCwryQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to Apple, Samsung, and Google, OnePlus doesn't offer certain mainline health features like an ECG for active AFib detection or passive tracking of irregular heart rhythm throughout the day. You don't get skin temperature readings for sleep quality or health warnings, nor menstrual cycle tracking (a fairly common feature across most watch brands). Nor is there any kind of fall detection feature.</p><p>It's also fair to call out the companion OHealth app, which is quite basic compared to Fitbit or Samsung Health. The data collected is shown in a pleasing and straightforward way, but you won't find an energy score, training load, sample workouts, health reports, food/ water logging, or any number of other essentials you take for granted with other watches. Exporting to Strava or using Health Connect is usually the best option.</p><p>If OnePlus wants to compete with the big-name brands, it needs to offer more value to its fitness-focused or health-conscious customers, or else make a deal with Google to make Fitbit the default.</p>
<h2 id="hoping-for-more-than-an-iterative-update-2">Hoping for more than an iterative update</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 watch face highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other small OnePlus Watch 3 requests like LTE support, a DC dimming option for the display for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive people</a>, a much higher max brightness (the Watch 2 and 2R hit 600 and 1,000 nits, respectively), and more interesting default watch faces.</p><p>But the real question comes down to what processor the OnePlus Watch 3 uses. I suspect it'll be the Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1, same as other recent watches like the Pixel Watch 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>. So it's a shame OnePlus couldn't have waited, since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">next Snapdragon chip is due in mid-2025</a> and could deliver far better performance and efficiency.</p><p>We gave the OnePlus Watch 2 a pass on a lot of things because it was the first Wear OS watch and did a fantastic job in key areas like battery life. But we'll be much harder on the Watch 3 if it can't catch up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> for <em>most</em> of the requests above.</p>

<ul><li>Max is preparing to begin its password-sharing crackdown for users "next week" for those with a stronger history of sharing.</li><li>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO and president of global and streaming, JB Perrette states its crackdown will get more restrictive in 2025.</li><li>We've been expecting this since March as Max views this change as a potential positive boost for its "growth" for subscribers <em>and </em>revenue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Streaming service Max has detailed what users can expect as 2024 winds down in terms of password sharing.</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO and president of global and streaming, JB Perrette states Max subscribers can expect its password-sharing crackdown to begin shortly, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2024/12/max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236193421/">Deadline</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown/">Android Police</a>). According to Perrette, things are set to kick off "next week." They add that these early stages are looked at as an "art and a science to try and tighten the filter of who’s in there."</p><p>The publication states that during the conference at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit, WBD made it clear that it would begin notifying users that it feels have been more prone to sharing their password with those <em>outside </em>the household. These initial messages are intended to be "gentle," though it wasn't explained how they will appear. These will likely be simple pop-up messages when opening the app, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Next week will also begin Max's data collecting period about how well it's detecting and notifying those who're sharing credentials.</p><p>Perrette states, "we will then start gradually as we get the data and start figuring out, with some explicit and implicit signals, how good we are at detecting. And then as we go through ’25, you’re going to see the filters get tighter and tighter."</p><p>Additionally, the company plans to incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-account-sharing-changes-us">a Netflix-style way</a> to add a "member" to your account.</p><p>A separate report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thewrap.com/max-password-sharing-crackdown-strategy-kick-off/">TheWrap</a> sees WBD's Perrette expand on the financial side of this venture. The service reportedly does not want to "oversell the scale" of its crackdown and its (potential) effect on its "margin for growth." However, Perrette states that Max could see "meaningful" growth in terms of subs <em>and </em>revenue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2507px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="koyJyobVogNNCMpB4PN975" name="Max-shows.jpg" alt="Selection of Max shows" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koyJyobVogNNCMpB4PN975.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2507" height="1410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Max)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-prepares-password-sharing-crackdown">expecting Max to begin</a> cracking down on password sharing since Perrette alluded to it in March. Similar to what's been said today, Max stressed the potential positive side effects of deploying such a method against sharing. It was stated that the company saw it as a "meaningful opportunity" relative to its "scale of business."</p><p>Max saw what Netflix did — though it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix/netflix-stock-plummet-password-sharing">was controversial</a> — and highlighted it as being "extremely successful."</p><p>The streaming platform's revenue report for Q4 2023 saw a drastic decline in profits as it reported a total loss of $55 million. Despite the sour note, it was a turnaround from its previous $217 million loss a year before that. It wasn't stated earlier this year if Max would pursue a way for users to add more members like Netflix, but with confirmation arriving today (Dec 3), it seems there are plans to try and stem the financial bleeding.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Max (at the time) was considering "ad format enhancements." The service was reportedly thinking about introducing shoppable ads, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-starts-rolling-out-shoppable-video-ads-worldwide">something YouTube's done with Shorts</a>.</p>

If that doesn&apos;t totally destroy your current phone bill, then I need to know who you&apos;re working with. </p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><em><strong>Mint Mobile's Cyber Monday sale is still going strong — see all the deals</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>The offer was originally unveiled last week and quickly rose to the ranks of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a>, but much to my dismay, it ran out of stock shortly thereafter. Fortunately, rather than sitting around to count up their coins, Mint Mobile has brought the offer back for all of us procrastinators — but who knows how long it will last this time.</p>

Google Pixel 9 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" data-dimension112="4317594b-82d0-49ed-a6a3-e4bada7d0d6b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799"><del>$799</del><strong> $299, plus 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> is one of our favorite 2024 phones and Mint Mobile is one of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a>, so <em>of course</em> we're thrilled to see the two join forces this holiday season. </p>
<p>It works like this: buy the phone at <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> alongside 12 months of the Unlimited plan and you'll score a straight $500 off, plus a 50% discount on the year of wireless. In other words, you can buy this AI-powered flagship phone for less than $500 and not worry about your phone bill again until January 2026. Can't beat that!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4317594b-82d0-49ed-a6a3-e4bada7d0d6b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the best phones released this year for cheap, and you&apos;re cool switching wireless carriers.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to be locked into one phone plan for an entire year; you regularly use more than 40GB of data every month. </p><p>One of our all-around favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">wireless plans</a> in the biz, Mint Mobile&apos;s Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data (capped at 40GB before speeds slow) on T-Mobile&apos;s historic 5G/4G LTE network. You also get free calls to Mexico and Canada, a mobile hotspot, and more. Once your twelve months of service are up, you&apos;re free to stick with Mint or go elsewhere, but the phone is yours forever.</p><p>Speaking of the phone, the Google Pixel 9 ranks among our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> released this year, thanks to its long software support, powerful cameras, and useful AI features. This leftover Cyber Monday deal from Mint Mobile already sold out once, so I&apos;d seriously advise acting fast if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<ul><li>Spotify Wrapped 2024 is officially here, providing a recap of everything you listened to this year.</li><li>In addition to the normal stats and curated playlists, Spotify threw a bit of AI into the mix.</li><li>With the help of Google's NotebookLM, there's a new "My Wrapped AI podcast" that provides a "personalized Audio Overview."</li></ul>
<p>Now that Thanksgiving is in the rearview mirror, the year is rapidly coming to an end. And just like clockwork, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-12-04/wrapped-user-experience-2024/" target="_blank">Spotify Wrapped 2024</a> is starting to roll out, letting you know everything you didn't want to know about your listening habits.</p><p>As expected, when accessing your personalized Wrapped landing page, you're presented with a bunch of curated playlists, along with the "Made for you" for music and "Your shows" for podcasts. Tap the "Let's go" button, and the Spotify app gives us an Instagram Stories-like experience, revealing different stats about what you listened to throughout the year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yLcqjj9sQBZ69Dx4JkT3aH" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-official-screenshots" alt="Spotify Wrapped 2024 screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLcqjj9sQBZ69Dx4JkT3aH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not all that Spotify Wrapped 2024 includes, as there's a bit of AI thrown into the mix. After being introduced for Premium subscribers earlier this year, AI DJ gets an upgrade as it is now capable of "providing commentary about your year alongside the music that soundtracked it." With AI Playlist, you're now able to prompt the app to create different playlists using information from Wrapped.</p><p>Although we figured AI would be included in some capacity, we didn't expect to see Google involved. There's an all-new "My Wrapped AI Podcast," which Spotify states was "built with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">Google's NotebookLM</a>", via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a> feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.66%;"><img id="jTKNTRAoineZJ2KskuFobH" name="spotify-wrapped-ai-podcast-official-screenshots" alt=""My Spotify Wrapped AI podcast" screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jTKNTRAoineZJ2KskuFobH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="529" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might sound odd to listen to an AI-generated podcast just to remind you that Drake lost to Kendrick, there's no denying that this is a unique addition. Plus, the podcast features "two dynamic hosts using generative AI," so it'll be interesting to see if this hangs around.</p><p>Google managed to beat Spotify to the punch, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-recap-2024-arrives-early">YouTube Music Recap 2024</a> began rolling out in the middle of November. While there are some new and unique features, there's actually not as much subscriber-facing AI integration as you might have thought.</p><p>If you want you're a Spotify Premium subscriber and want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">check out your Wrapped 2024</a>, make sure the app is updated to the latest version. Then, it can be found amongst the filter buttons at the top of the screen.</p>

I love it because I enjoy breaking down crazy tech talk into a thing anyone can understand. Sometimes, though, I get a question that goes beyond the scope of a simple tech advice piece because there is no easy answer.</p><p>I got one of those recently, and someone was asking about the speed of a phone chip versus how many cores it has and what is more important. I'm going to try and simplify it here and help everyone understand that there is no real answer to which is better, and why.</p>

<p>The processor inside your phone isn't just a processor — it's a complete package that offers multiple functions known as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-soc">SoC</a> (System on Chip).</p><p>A SoC is a type of integrated circuit that contains <em>most</em> of the components that power the brains of a device. In a typical phone or tablet, the SoC has the device's processor and GPU cores, other processors for things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-leverage-ai-to-make-weather-forecasting-more-efficient">AI acceleration</a>, reserved space for cached data and memory needed by the system, Digital Signal Processors (DSP) for things like camera capture and audio, external interfaces for various communication protocols, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/verizon-ericsson-and-qualcomm-reach-107-gbps-lte-downloads">wireless modems for connectivity.</a></p><p>There are also devices like timers, voltage regulators, or power management ICs that don't really affect performance. It's also worth noting that some wireless modems and device memory modules can either be in the SoC or external depending on the device.</p><p>In short, there is a lot of stuff going on inside one small chip that needs a lot of power and runs incredibly hot.</p>
<p>Some companies build SoCs tailored for a unique experience while others make SoCs designed to work well across plenty of devices. There are pros and cons to each approach, but chances are your devices have the latter style of SoC inside from a company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">Qualcomm</a>. These companies work hard to make chips that perform well when used as designed; a chip designed for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> isn't ideal for a phone, and vice-versa. They all use the same basic concept though — build a package of hardware where each component compliments the others and the result also complements the hardware a user interacts with.</p>

<p>When you focus on the "processor" portion of the SoC things are a little confusing. You'll see specs that list several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy-leak">different cores clocked at different speeds</a>, and the internet is filled with people arguing the merits of all of them. Ignore those arguments for a moment.</p><p><strong>You need balance more than anything else</strong> for the performance you've come to expect from a device like a phone. It would be best to have some cores that aren't extremely fast, some that are, and software designed to distribute the load in a way that offers the right mix of speed and battery life. And that is hard to do on every level.</p>
<p>A CPU (Central Processing Unit, where most computing tasks are done) core can only do one thing at a time. All computer processing is math, and the core inside a CPU can't really think ahead or look backward; it only tackles the one problem in front of it before it moves on to the next one.</p><p>Clock speed — the GHz numbers you see in the spec sheet, determine how fast each thing can be done. It's all done incredibly fast (millions of operations per second) and the higher the speed the faster each operation is performed.</p><p>Cores determine how many things can be done at the same time. If one core can do 100,000 things per second (no CPU core is this slow but it's an easy number) then five cores can do 500,000 things per second. The more cores a CPU has, the more tasks can be run concurrently.</p>
<p>A thread is a set of instructions for the CPU core. They share the same resources as the process that created them but they can be switched so fast it seems like a CPU core is doing more than one thing at a time.</p><p>If you have a CPU with several fast cores, threads work to make multiple things happen so fast that it seems like they happen at the same time because our brains are not nearly as fast as a CPU core.</p><p>You need fast in-order processing calculation performance on a single core, fast out-of-order (using threads) calculation performance on a single core, and ultra-fast in and out-of-order calculation performance on multiple cores for a good user experience. That's where software comes into play.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KHgGvxGtDZKZdQ6n6pkbc4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-gaming-official-01.jpg" alt="An official Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHgGvxGtDZKZdQ6n6pkbc4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, a fast CPU core means an application will run quickly on a computer like your phone. Fast multiple cores mean more things can be done in the background, including multiple apps running at once. That's why both single-core and multi-core performance matters.</p><p>Some software, like a game or a video editing program, can be written in ways to benefit from multiple CPU cores, spreading processes and threads across cores in a single application.</p><p>The best analogy I've ever heard to describe this, and I wish I remember where I read it to credit the wise person who first said it:</p><p><strong>A highway has multiple lanes and a speed limit.</strong></p><p><strong>On Highway 10 you have a speed limit of 50 and eight lanes.</strong></p><p><strong>On Highway 11 you have a speed limit of 100 and one lane.</strong></p><p><strong>If you have one fast car you're better off using Highway 11. If you have eight slower trucks you are better off using Highway 10. Some software is a fast car and some is a fleet of slower trucks. The best thing to do would be to put Highway 10 beside Highway 11 and use both.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, we're doing multiple things at once but want whatever our eyes are looking at to run well. We're OK with letting the background tasks be a little slower. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">software powering your phone</a> needs to make sure the tasks running on it are prioritized this way.</p><p><strong>Is core clock speed more important than the number of cores?</strong> Yes, No. Sometimes. Maybe.</p><p>There is no answer to this because the right mix of the number of cores, their speed, and the software using them is what's really important.</p>
