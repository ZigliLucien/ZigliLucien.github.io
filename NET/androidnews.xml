<ul><li>Google Wallet is now rolling out its support for Apple Wallet passes to more users following its limited availability in March.</li><li>Its functionality is not working properly as users face errors when downloading a pass saved in Apple's ".pkpass" format.</li><li>Support for Apple's standard pass format joins Google's work to bring more boarding passes to its Wallet app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google Wallet is activating support for Apple Wallet passes for more users, but a problem has been spotted early on.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/04/google-wallet-apple-wallet-pass-files-how/">9to5Google</a>, the ability of Google Wallet users to access important ".pkpass" files has become widely available to more users. This file format is Apple&apos;s format used for digital passes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the publication has spotted a frustrating problem with Wallet&apos;s support for Apple&apos;s format: not every <em>app </em>supports it on Android.</p><p>It was discovered that the "Add to Apple Wallet" option consistently failed to appear in a few Android apps. Services weren&apos;t giving users the appropriate Apple file format for them to throw into Google Wallet for safekeeping. Another attempt delivered an error when adding some minor league baseball tickets to Wallet.</p><p>The error prompted users to try opening the link in Safari (the default browser on iOS), but Android users cannot do that.</p><p>The report adds that users can use an iPhone to transfer a pass to their Android device if problems become too troublesome. The publication states users can "share a pass via messaging and other apps" from an iPhone to an Android device, which will deliver the necessary ".pkpass" for them to import into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>More users should begin noticing support for Apple&apos;s digital pass format available on Android today (Apr. 5) and beyond. More importantly, apps should also start conforming to this newfound support, but it will likely take time to iron out the errors.</p>

<p>Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">started noticing support</a> for Apple&apos;s pass format in March, though it was constricted to a smaller number. Such support has been coming for a long time, as Google stated it was working on implementing functionality back in 2022. However, evidence of the feature in development was only spotted in 2023.</p><p>The latest support for Wallet is one of many, as Google recently brought in additional support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">more boarding passes</a> directly from Gmail. Users receiving confirmation emails for movies and flights can now easily pop those passes into Google Wallet. The update also included archiving older passes, keeping what&apos;s important clean and concise.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing confirms on X that it plans to unveil the "Ear" and "Ear a" buds on April 18.</li><li>The company states that the name change will help it better focus on the "product" and "unique experience" it provides for consumers.</li><li>Little information about the devices has leaked, but the existence of an "a" tag for one suggests it could fall on the budget side like the Phone 2a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has been confirmed, but consumers will be treated to two earbud launches from the London-based company later this month.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1776236686340464931?s=20">posted on X</a> today (Apr. 5), stating folks should get ready to see the Nothing "Ear" and "Ear a" on April 18. Essentially, the newly announced "Ear" is the successor to the Ear 2 launched in March 2023. The post adds that the upcoming devices are the "ultimate iteration of Nothing audio" and "reflect the culmination of three years of design and innovation."</p><p>This also (obviously) comes with a curious name change that makes it seem like we&apos;re restarting the series. Nothing states the purpose of its naming strategy reset, which includes removing the series number, is to better focus on "the product and the unique experience."</p><p>The company reiterated that it will continue to create premium devices for consumers that prioritize user preference over price.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We started Nothing with audio in 2021 and since our very first product, weâve relentlessly refined our design and engineering with every new addition to our audio product suite. 2024 is the year weâre unveiling the ultimate iteration of Nothing Audio with two new products thatâ¦ pic.twitter.com/bRrFzk9wUl<a href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1776236686340464931">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-3-frog-beetle-teaser">started teasing</a> its new earbud device late in March, and the provided teasers made it seem like we were continuing to the Ear 3. The post featured a little tree frog leaping over a black beetle. The latter was used to promote the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a> before it launched in 2023.</p><p>The most interesting development is that we&apos;re set to receive an "Ear a" to accompany the, assumedly, "flagship-level" buds. With the "a" moniker, the second pair of buds seems to follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>: a budget phone that came with a premium-level design and some slight software/hardware changes to keep the price down.</p><p>We don&apos;t exactly have much to bite into as Nothing has spilled much information regarding either of the devices. We can refer to Ear 2 as a device that features refined sound and improved ANC capabilities. The device also gained a smaller charging case to make it easier to carry around. Internally, it picked up an 11.6mm custom driver for rich sound.</p><p>It remains to be seen where Nothing will go after its 2023 release. Fortunately, we only have a couple of weeks to wait.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Android 14 beta contains information regarding Google's development of a desktop mode overhaul for Android 15.</li><li>The overhaul would fully revamp its freeform mode, giving users more agency over how to manage multiple windows.</li><li>Other Android 15 news involves additional features for its "Private Spaces" and a potential new status bar later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>More of what Android 15 could have in store surfaces as a discovery shows Google is preparing some long-awaited improvements to desktop mode.</p><p>As detailed by Mishaal Rahman with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-desktop-mode-demo-3430991/">Android Authority</a>, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 shows that Google plans to implement a new multi-window experience. From the demonstration video, apps in full-screen now feature a navigation bar-style tab at the top. Tapping it produces a drop menu featuring the app&apos;s name and a few options: full-screen, split-screen, and freeform mode.</p><p>Split-screen functions like any other Android device. It places the app on half the display, giving users a chance to open another. Freeform mode lets users decide the window&apos;s size by dragging its rounded corners.</p><p>Moreover, testing showed that the apps gain a thick title bar featuring the app&apos;s name, a maximize button, and a close button. Tapping its name will produce the previously mentioned menu full of window options.</p><p>Rahman adds that users can drag a window in freeform mode to either side of the display to "snap it" into split-screen mode.</p><p>This desktop mode revamp is likely for Android 15; however, it&apos;s not clear exactly when it will roll out. The changes seem to make Android&apos;s OS seem a little more refined, but as Rahman noted, it still doesn&apos;t support keyboard shortcuts for window management or offer a polished launcher.</p>

<p>It seems that Google has been mulling over improving its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/with-pixel-8-google-may-finally-have-an-answer-to-samsung-dex">Android desktop mode</a> for a while, even during the early days of the Pixel 8. It was then discovered that the Pixel 8 series launched with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-series-apparently-supports-display-output">display output support</a>. Despite Google disabling its functionality on the software side, its hardware hid nothing, as users could attach a USB-C to HDMI cable to get things started.</p><p>The discovery was on functionality alone, as the Pixel 8 didn&apos;t showcase a <em>proper </em>desktop mode.

<p>As someone who used to downright avoid Samsung phones at all costs, I find it absolutely wild to see the turnaround that&apos;s happened. While the TouchWiz era still invokes a sense of cringe whenever I think about it, Samsung has managed to completely turn its software around, especially when it comes to updates.</p><p>In late March, Samsung started rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">One UI 6.1</a>, including much more than a few bug fixes. Instead, this wasÂ <em>the</em>Â update to install for those using 2023 flagships, such as the Galaxy S23 or Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung brought many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI features</a> introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> to these older devices, with rumors that they could even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">come to the Galaxy S22 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-hinge-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>But that&apos;s not what surprised me the most about the rollout. It was the fact that every single device on the list got the update at around the same time. After seeing the news, I grabbed my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>, checked for an update, and sat back as both devices downloaded and installed their respective updates.</p><p>Not to mention that the Galaxy S24 received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-march-camera-update">separate update</a> at the same time, just with a focus on camera improvements, and Samsung&apos;s smartwatches also received updates, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> series receiving a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-watch5-update/">improvements</a>.</p><p>This is the dream that we&apos;ve been hoping to see from Google, Samsung, and other OEMs. Whenever Apple releases a new update, most of the time, the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch all get an update simultaneously. However, we&apos;ve been dealing with staggered update releases on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> for years.</p><p>It definitely gives more credence to the idea that Samsung is morphing into the Apple of the Android space. Updates are all arriving together, new features are constantly arriving in one form or fashion, and the company is making efforts to provide a cohesive ecosystem. All the while, Google still seems to be falling a bit short of what we expect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Google-Circle-to-Search-01.jpg" alt="Using Google Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not to say Google is terrible with its updates. Sure, if it weren&apos;t for Google, Samsung&apos;s operating system would probably look a lot different than it does. After all, One UI is "just a skin" sitting atop the underlying Android platform. This obviously gives Samsung the ability to focus on improving One UI and implementing new APIs or features when Google adds them to Android (or even before Google can).</p><p>I can&apos;t help but feel as though Google is losing its grip a little, even though the company&apos;s phone division continues to see growth. The only evidence that you need is to see what happened with Gemini Nano. When initially introduced, a Google exec stated that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>-powered AI features were limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Many, myself included, wanted to know why the Pixel 8 wasn&apos;t going to be getting any of those features despite the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro largely sharing the same underlying hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QifomcUdXo2dssoKTPYYCL" name="pixel-8-21.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QifomcUdXo2dssoKTPYYCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the time, Google explained that it was due to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">hardware limitations</a>." But again, that didn&apos;t make any sense, given the hardware that was shared between the two devices. Lo and behold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">Google eventually revealed</a> that Gemini NanoÂ <em>will</em>Â come to the Pixel 8, albeit "as a developer option with the next Pixel Feature Drop," and even then, the announcement came much later. Meanwhile, Gemini Nano has already been available on the Galaxy S24 series, including the smallest model with 8GB or RAM.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-hope-google-doesnt-limit-assistant-with-bard">ongoing debacle</a> with the Pixel Fold, which is seeing none of the Gemini Nano features. That&apos;s a $1,800 phone that isn&apos;t capable of providing the same user experience as one that costs $1,100 less. It wasn&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-will-roll-out-to-more-devices">until this week</a> that Google even brought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature to the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, and that&apos;s not even to mention the delays seen with previous updates on Pixel models in recent years.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">doesn&apos;t exactly instill confidence</a> that Google will actually be able to follow through on its seven-year promise for software updates in any meaningful way if it can&apos;t fully commit to giving us the same features on current-gen hardware. Setting aside the differences between Tensor and Snapdragon, I&apos;m more confident with Samsung&apos;s ability to follow through than Google&apos;s.Â </p><p>While I do believe it was the right move by Google, I can&apos;t help but feel as though the difference between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24</a> in seven years will be night and day. Maybe I&apos;m wrong here, and I hope I am, but it&apos;s becoming more apparent that something is awry in Mountain View.Â </p><p>All of that is to say that I can&apos;t help but feel as though the software side of Google, you know, Android, feels a bit broken. This is a real shame, considering how great the hardware seems to be, even if it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">doesn&apos;t really hold up</a> after a couple of years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="52pxjwM2k3bG96uWEhuxxn" name="Google-Pixel-6-vs-pixel-6a-backs-angle-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 vs Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/52pxjwM2k3bG96uWEhuxxn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it almost feels as though Google needs another "reset year," like we saw when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> was introduced. The company needs to get the hardware and software teams on a level playing field so that the ecosystem can continue to mature and grow without users running into limitations and delays.</p><p>If Google wants to continue to see growth and become a worthy alternative to Samsung and Apple, particularly in the U.S., something has to give. We&apos;ve dealt with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/genius-google-play-services">fragmentation</a> for years, but we&apos;ve reached the point of putting the blame on Google and not the OEMs. For a company worth so much money, it&apos;s really mind-boggling to see.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The great thing about Android phones and tablets is the convenient access to the most powerful search engine out there, Google Search. The Google Search widget does a lot more, such as offering one-tap access to Google Lens and voice search. To make accessing this even easier, nearly all phones these days come with the Google Search widget preinstalled on the home screen. On Pixel phones, this widget is baked into the Pixel launcher itself and cannot be removed even if you want to.Â </p><p>If you&apos;ve gone ahead and removed the widget from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> because perhaps it wasn&apos;t blending in with the theme or style of your phone&apos;s interface, we&apos;ll show you how you can easily customize the look of the Google Search widget with a few simple steps.Â </p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-google-search-widget-2">How to change the appearance of the Google Search widget</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you don&apos;t already have the Search widget on your Android home screen, you can easily add it by pressing a long button on any empty space on the home screen and choosing <strong>Widgets </strong>from the bottom carousel. Simply scroll till you find the &apos;Search&apos; widget under Google. You can have more than one search widget too on different homescreens, if you want.<br>
<br>
The following steps were carried out on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-10-pro-review">OnePlus 10 Pro</a> running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, so some options could vary a little depending on your device or the version of Android you may have, but they should generally be the same.</p>
<p>1. Tap the colorful <strong>G logo</strong> in the left corner of the widget. This should bring up the Google Discover page.Â </p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile photo</strong> in the top-right corner and then <strong>Settings </strong>at the bottom.Â </p><p>3. Scroll down till you find the sub-menu <strong>Search Widget</strong>. Tap it, and then tap <strong>Customize widget</strong>.Â </p><p>4. This will bring up a preview of your current widget against your device&apos;s wallpaper. All the options to customize it are at the bottom.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.43%;"><img id="GWuGuBjh9T4YF633ru6xJf" name="customize-google-search-widget-step-one.jpg" alt="Screenshots showing Google Search widget settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWuGuBjh9T4YF633ru6xJf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1429" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, you can go through any of the four options below to edit your Google Search widget to your liking and give it a whole new look. If at any point you want to revert all the changes, you can simply tap the Reset to Default Style option at the bottom of the Customize menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.53%;"><img id="KgG7sq3fayuCfs88v4SfHA" name="Google-Search-widget-customization.jpg" alt="Google search widget customization options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KgG7sq3fayuCfs88v4SfHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li>The first G menu lets you toggle between having just the letter "G" or "Google" appear in the widget.Â </li><li>The menu with the shapes icon lets you change the shape of the search box from the default pill shape to a rectangle, either with sharp or rounded corners.Â </li><li>The menu with the color palette icon really lets you have some fun. You can make the widget monochrome or darken the search box. The last option is a color picker, where you can choose any RGB shade and adjust the saturation. I like that when you choose a darker color, the color of the symbols in the widget automatically invert, so it's easier to see</li><li>The fourth menu gives you a slider to adjust the transparency of the widget, letting you go from translucent so you can see the wallpaper through the search box to a completely solid color.</li></ul>

<p>The Google Search widget is a powerful tool that is often overlooked by many users. It offers quick and easy access to Google search, rather than having to open Chrome and then do a search. Not only that, you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-plan-more-sustainable-vacation-google-search">plan an entire vacation using just Search</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-quickly-book-doctors-visit-google-search">book a doctor&apos;s appointment</a>.</p><p>Better yet, you get direct access to one of Google&apos;s most powerful tools right at your fingertips. The little camera logo in the widget brings up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a>, a visual search tool that lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-lens-search-images-text-simultaneously">search with text and images simultaneously</a>. It also lets you do live translation of any text you point your camera at, and you can choose the language you want it to translate to.</p><p>The microphone icon in the Search widget brings up Voice Search, which you can use to search by speaking into your device or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-assistant-identify-songs">identify songs</a> that you hear around you.</p><p>Now that you know how to customize the Google Search widget, you can use it more often. The best part is that every single Android phone or tablet can access this widget as it&apos;s built into the operating system.Â </p>

<ul><li>Google is considering making some of its AI features in Search, like Search Generative Experience, locked behind a subscription.Â </li><li>Search Generative Experience started as an experimental Search Labs feature but has since expanded to more users.</li><li>Google already offers premium features to subscribers through the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is hard at work developing artificial intelligence features, and some of them leverage the company&apos;s dominance in search. For example, Search Generative Experience (SGE) is an AI-based feature that creates summaries in response to user queries in Google Search from web results. Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">features like SGE are free</a>, but a new report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4bfeb4-6579-4819-9f5f-b3a46ff59ed1" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> says that Google might not keep this model forever. It could make SGE and other AI features in Google Search a paid experience.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t been shy about asking users to pay for advanced AI tools across its suite of services. Last year, the company introduced the Duet AI subscription service for business users in Google Workspace. (That subscription is now being rebranded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-business-enterprise-workspace-plans-may-launch-soon">Gemini for Workspace</a>.) Recently, Google started offering a consumer-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscription for features like Gemini Advanced. It&apos;s not that big of a leap for Google to want to bring other AI tools under its umbrella of subscriptions.Â </p><p>The Financial Times spoke to three people "with knowledge of [Google&apos;s] plans," who said that Google is considering adding the generative AI features in Search to its subscription services. While the report states Google is actively developing a system for subscription-based features like SGE, a decision has not been made yet.Â </p><p>Google told the Financial Times it would "continue to build new premium capabilities and services to enhance our subscription offerings across Google." Additionally, the company said it is not working on or considering an ad-free option for Google Search, nixing the idea that a paid SGE plan would reduce ads.<br>
<br>
âFor years, weâve been reinventing Search to help people access information in the way thatâs most natural to them,â Google said in a statement to the Financial Times. âWith our generative AI experiments in Search, weâve already served billions of queries, and weâre seeing positive Search query growth in all of our major markets. Weâre continuing to rapidly improve the product to serve new user needs.â</p><p>Regarding its potential plans for SGE, Google said it didn&apos;t have anything to announce at the moment. However, Google&apos;s statement does not rule out making SGE a paid feature sometime in the future. In fact, the company expressing its desire to enhance subscription offerings may indicate that Google is leaning toward the idea.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the reported plans to make SGE a paid feature, and they did not get back to us in time for publication.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When I began reviewing the Garmin Forerunner 165, I was worried that it would feel too much like a downgrade compared to my long-time Forerunner 965 watch. I told myself not to hold any shortcomings against it since Garmin designed it as a budget running watch.</p><p>Instead, I found that the Forerunner 165 outperforms its price; it hardly feels cheap at all.Â </p><p>Garmin&apos;s first attempts at sub-$300 watches with AMOLED displays â the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Venu Sq 2</a> and Vivoactive 5 â put more emphasis on a mainstream design that appealed to non-Garmin fans. The Garmin Forerunner 165 looks cheaper, but it feels more like a watch built <em>for</em> Garmin fans who want to save some money, and it&apos;s that distinction why it&apos;s already on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> today.</p><p>That being said, Garmin did disable a running feature on the Forerunner 165, most likely to make its $449 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Forerunner 265</a> look more appealing. Whether you can save money with the 165 or not will depend on how much of a data-driven runner you are.Â </p>

<p>Released on February 20, 2024, the Garmin Forerunner 165 costs $249.99, while the Forerunner 165 Music costs $299.99. The latter version includes 4GB of music storage space and Wi-Fi supportâthe base 165 relies solely on Bluetoothâbut has no other differences.Â </p><p>For context, the 165 Music has about 3.5GB of <em>actual</em> space for your Spotify, Deezer, or Amazon Music playlists â or your MP3 files. I could fit about 500 songs from my personal library via the Garmin Express desktop app. However, this will vary based on the size and quality of your music files. If you want more space, the Forerunner 265 Music has 8GB of storage, while the Forerunner 965 has 32GB for music and maps.</p><p>Both versions of the Forerunner 165 ship in Black or Mist Gray cases, with dual-tone Slate Gray or Whitestone silicone bands, respectively. Only the Forerunner 165 Music has more colorful options: a Berry case with a Lilac strap or a Turquoise case with an Aqua strap.Â </p><p>Garmin uses 20mm Quick Release bands for the Forerunner 165, meaning they&apos;re easily swapped out by pulling a tab. You can buy replacement straps of any color in silicone ($39.99 each), nylon ($69.99), or leather ($69.99) from Garmin directly, or look at third-party options.Â </p>

<p>If you&apos;ve owned a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Garmin Forerunner watch</a> before now, you generally know what to expect from the 165. It&apos;s easy to take Garmin&apos;s algorithm for granted, but you still won&apos;t find rival brands that can recommend a customized daily run that takes your current fitness and fatigue levels into account.</p><p>In my case, I rarely <em>select</em> daily suggested workouts like the one above because I like having a little flexibility without the Forerunner watch buzzing my wrist if I go off-pace. But it almost always inspires my choice of how hard to run and whether to stick to my neighborhood, jog to the track, or take a longer route loop.</p><p>To get this guidance in a $250 running watch with no monthly subscription is particularly special, knowing that most Garmin watches have the durability and post-launch software support to make them last for a few years, at least. Case in point, the 2015 Forerunner 235 and 2019 Forerunner 245 are still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-watch-from-2015-most-popular-on-strava">most popular watches on Strava</a>.</p><p>I predict that the Forerunner 165 could eventually take that spot for a number of reasons â starting, obviously, with the low price compared to most Garmin watches.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> has been my daily watch for about a year, and I&apos;ve gotten used to its weight and thickness in exchange for the 23-day battery life and a 1.4-inch display. Once I switched to the Forerunner 165, which is half an ounce lighter and 1.6mm thinner, I suddenly remembered why I prefer lighter watches during long runs.Â </p><p>The Forerunner 165 design isn&apos;t what I&apos;d call stylish, but that&apos;s true of most Garmins, and I care more that my wrist feels pleasantly light wearing it. I become more aware of the 965 whenever I hold my wrist up to check my pace, but the 165 falls out of my perception more quickly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qJmYEsqBv7QpPUcm9FV7K4" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-side-wrist-view.jpeg" alt="Close up view of the Garmin Forerunner 165 case and band on the author's wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJmYEsqBv7QpPUcm9FV7K4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m also a fan of its lug-heavy silicone band for a secure and breathable fit that&apos;s not overly tight â even if I&apos;ve noticed that the 965&apos;s silicone band seems slightly softer and more flexible. One could wish that Garmin offered a nylon upgrade at checkout instead of making you pay an extra $70, but I&apos;ve gotten used to this moisture-wicking option.</p><p>The Forerunner 165&apos;s thin size and AMOLED display do affect its battery life, but I&apos;ll point out that plenty of past Forerunners like the 245 and 745 â which cost the same or more â only lasted a week per charge, despite the MIP displays. The Forerunner 165&apos;s 11-day battery with a more readable display is definitely an improvement, within the typical range for most cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a>.</p><p>I&apos;ll admit that 17 hours of all-systems GNSS tracking is on the low side for a Garmin watch, and it does require more frequent charging than I&apos;ve grown accustomed to with daily runs or walks. But it&apos;s about context: it&apos;ll still feel game-changing to non-Garmin users, there&apos;s no possible way it&apos;ll die on you during a race, and you can always pay for pricier Forerunners if the extra battery is a necessity.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-run-power-zones.jpeg" alt="The post-run Run Power Zones on the Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDfb3CqChaNnV4YouNkmcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-55-review">Forerunner 55</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-745-review">Forerunner 745</a>, or any other Forerunner more than a few years old, then the Forerunner 165 will feel properly next-generation, with hardware upgrades that any runner would appreciate.</p><p>For starters, you switch from a memory-in-pixel (MIP) non-touch display to a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen with superior resolution âÂ 390 x 390 versus 208 x 208 with the Forerunner 55. While this does cut three days of battery, I find that reading notifications and fitness charts without squinting becomes significantly easier, especially indoors, where MIP displays look dim unless you crank the backlight.</p><p>More importantly, you get the Elevate v4 sensor, which is capable of registering heart rate variability (HRV) for stress and more functional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-body-battery">Body Battery</a> recharge data. Yes, it&apos;s not the newer v5 sensor of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> with ECG and skin temperature, but that&apos;s a tall ask for a cheaper watch. As far as I&apos;ve seen in tests against chest heart rate straps, Garmin&apos;s v4 and v5 tech are comparable for core heart rate accuracy, and other (more expensive) Forerunners like the 965 use v4 as well.Â </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The AMOLED display, accurate GNSS tracking, and reliable heart rate data make the Forerunner 165 feel truly next-gen compared to past Forerunners. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Plus, of course, Garmin gave the Forerunner 165 access to an all-systems GNSS mode that pulls from GPS, GALILEO, and GLONASS simultaneously. Having two satellite signals prevents inaccurate workout data in most contexts, even if it can&apos;t pinpoint quite as well as dual-frequency GPS on the pricier Forerunners. If you&apos;ve made do with GPS-only up until now, you should appreciate the improved results (which I&apos;ll discuss in the next section).Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Pt4YVkQpX6oHLGDoYcqyPm" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-workout-benefit.jpeg" alt="The estimated workout benefit for a daily suggested workout on the Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pt4YVkQpX6oHLGDoYcqyPm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The updates don&apos;t stop there: the Forerunner 165 has an altimeter for judging elevation gain, something missing from the Forerunner 55 and more recent Vivoactive 5. It&apos;s a must-have for runners since inaccurate elevation data means your watch can&apos;t attribute higher heart rates to hills, skewing your VO2 Max results.Â </p><p>In addition, if you like to download GPX files for offline courses, only the Forerunner 165 has a compass for breadcrumb navigation. There isn&apos;t enough room for topographical maps like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> has, but Garmin treats that as a premium feature, so the 265 doesn&apos;t have this either.</p><p>On the software side, the Forerunner 165 isn&apos;t that different from the 55; plenty of my favorite Garmin training metrics require a 265 or 965 upgrade. You do, at least, see post-run Training Effect data showing its aerobic or anaerobic impact, and you can cross-train with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">indoor workouts</a>.Â </p><p>You even get wrist-based running power and form analysis, which isn&apos;t especially helpful for amateurs unless you have a running coach or pro group to contextualize the data. I&apos;m more grateful that the Forerunner 165 added audio prompts, shouting out mile times so you&apos;re not constantly checking your wrist.</p>

<p>Last month, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">tested the Forerunner 165 against COROS and Fitbit trackers</a> for GPS, elevation, step, and heart rate accuracy. I&apos;m going to summarize the results here, along with some supplemental info.Â </p><p>For step count, it tracked 6,016 steps after 6,000 actual steps, tracked with a physical pedometer. The next closest was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> (91 steps above), with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> nearly 200 steps short of the actual total. It proved that the Forerunner 165 does the best for basic tracking if you&apos;re passionate about getting 10,000 steps a day.</p>

<p>For GPS accuracy, I weighed its All-Systems GNSS mode against the COROS PACE 3 dual-frequency mode, which (on paper) should be more accurate. My run maps above disabused this notion: my Garmin Forerunner 165 (pink) consistently stayed on the trail most of the time, while the COROS PACE 3 (orange) frequently strayed off the path. Their ultimate distance result â 5 miles for Garmin, 5.02 for COROS â wasn&apos;t that different, however.</p><p>(The Fitbit Charge 6&apos;s "Dynamic GPS," which combines results from its built-in satellite and my phone location data, was so erratic that I didn&apos;t bother cluttering my maps with the results).</p>

<p>During a subsequent mile-long track run in the third lane, the Garmin Forerunner 165 measured the correct 1,660-meter distance, while the actual GPS line had me drifting into left lanes before turns, filling the coverage gap. Again, COROS looked significantly worse on the map but had a similar distance total, while Fitbit&apos;s wonky GPS-only data (blue) was both inconsistent and 35 meters short.</p><p>Analyzing these results, it&apos;s clear that Garmin&apos;s mid-tier location tech is better than its rivals&apos; top-tier results. I can&apos;t say whether Garmin&apos;s GPS-only watches are as unreliable as the Fitbit Charge 6 was, but assuming they are, your post-run pace and distance might be significantly off. The Forerunner 165 and its All-Systems GNSS could make a real difference in un-skewing your training data.</p>

<p>As for heart rate accuracy, you can check how the Forerunner 165 results compared to the Polar H10 chest strap across a five-mile run (above) and during a track workout (below).Â </p><p>For a standard run, the Forerunner 165 was consistently accurate for nearly the entire run, with the same average and minimum heart rates and only a 1 bpm difference for max heart rate. It kept up with the Polar H10 when my heart rate rose quickly on hills but did lag slightly at catching my <em>falling</em> heart rate on downhills.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1880" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the track run, I alternated between sprints and jogs to see how well the Forerunner 165 could handle rapid changes in heart rate âÂ a problem with wrist-based optical sensors.</p><p>The Forerunner 165 average bpm was only 1 bpm higher than the Polar H10, and the chest strap had a visible glitch with deflated results early in the workout, so I&apos;d say they were very close. That said, you can definitely see how the Forerunner 165 lagged behind the Polar H10 during those sudden changes, both for heart rate increases and decreases.</p><p>I won&apos;t include the other heart rate charts here, but the Fitbit Charge 6 stayed mostly in lockstep with the chest strap during both runs, beating the Forerunner 165, while the COROS PACE 3 matched Garmin during the five-mile run but lagged even worse during the track run.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-polar-h10-coros-pace-3-and-fitbit-charge-6-on-table.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 165, COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Polar H10 sitting together on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, you can&apos;t fault these results in a $250 watch, especially the steps, elevation, and GPS distance.Â </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Weeks of Forerunner 165 testing have me confident that it's as accurate for heart rate and GPS data as costlier running watches.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Only Fitbit does better in this price range for heart rate, but the poor location tracking offsets the benefits. I haven&apos;t found that the pricier Forerunners are any more accurate for heart rate, either, and even though the Forerunner 165 lags a bit for rapid heart rate changes, it averages out to the correct result in the end. If you want more accurate heart rate results than this, don&apos;t look at pricier running watches: Look at the Polar H10 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS heart rate monitor</a>.Â </p>

<p>For further context, I finished a 5K run of my neighborhood loop wearing the Forerunner 165 and 965 to check the gap in results between the $250 and $600 models. As you can see, my heart rate average was identical, a predictable but welcome result given that both use the Elevate v4 sensor.Â </p><p>Location accuracy is the minor sticking point. The Forerunner 165 measured an extra 0.02 miles after 3.1 miles, which skewed my pace by a second. It&apos;s fair to assume the Forerunner 965 is more accurate thanks to dual-frequency tracking, but it&apos;s also fair to note that this gap is minimal compared to GPS-only watches that&apos;ll be off by half a minute per mile.</p><p>Unless you frequently run near tall buildings or under dense foliage â which would make dual-frequency GPS especially helpful â I&apos;d say that you can probably make do with the Forerunner 165&apos;s all-systems GNSS.</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t already tell, I really like the Garmin Forerunner 165, and I think most runners will, too. That said, it has plenty of compromises compared to the pricier models, with Garmin tantalizing you with missing features and cutbacks to upgrade to the 265.Â </p><p>On the design side, its polymer materials are rugged and lightweight, but you won&apos;t get an MIL-STD-810G rating like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a>, and its "chemically strengthened glass" isn&apos;t as scratch-proof as the 265&apos;s Gorilla Glass 3 treatment, nor as immune to reflections as the 965&apos;s Gorilla Glass DX.Â </p><p>More importantly, its plastic, button-heavy look isn&apos;t attractive; that also applies to other Forerunners, to be fair, but I want to make that clear for people who haven&apos;t grown accustomed to the Garmin aesthetic and prefer aluminum or steel casing.</p><p>Visually, the 1.2-inch display is bright enough, and since Garmin&apos;s UI doesn&apos;t do anything complicated, the Forerunner 165&apos;s thick bezel is more of an aesthetic issue than a functional one.Â </p><p>With its focus solely on health, sleep, and fitness tracking, the Forerunner 165 will feel substandard to anyone who likes powerful smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6</a>, which costs $50 more and gives you a full series of apps, including third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> like Strava or Nike Run Club.Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bi5VtC84xafVTsmEvAqTsH" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-load-focus-2.jpeg" alt="The load focus screen on the Garmin Forerunner 965, showing high and low aerobic and anaerobic load data from the past month" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bi5VtC84xafVTsmEvAqTsH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Training load focus on the Forerunner 265 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving away from general downgrades to missing Garmin features, the Garmin Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t track training load or load focus. Technically, it <em>can</em> register post-run load, but you&apos;ll only see it in the Garmin Connect app if you own a pricier Forerunner like the 265 with training load data.Â </p><p>Training load matters because it helps me determine whether I&apos;m over- or undertraining compared to past weeks and which type of run (low aerobic, high aerobic, or anaerobic) I need to do next to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve my VO2 Max</a> over time. I wrote last month that this missing feature, purposefully excluded by Garmin, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-want-to-swap-my-garmin-forerunner-965-for-165-and-why-i-cant">reason why I can&apos;t replace my Forerunner 965 with the 165</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Without Training Load and Status, it's harder to confirm if you're improving or deteriorating as a runner. This data can be enlightening or discouraging, and while data-driven runners will miss this, others will want to avoid the distraction.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Other absent features include Training Status, which essentially summarizes whether your fitness is improving based on your Training Load, and the corresponding VO2 Max chart showing your changing score in recent weeks. You also lose Training Readiness, which goes beyond your Body Battery and estimated recovery time to judge your stamina level before a workout. Even if you&apos;re fully recovered from your last run, you still might not be "ready" due to stress, poor sleep, or other factors.</p><p>I could continue to list features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-performance-condition-needs-revamp">Performance Condition</a>, a lactate threshold test, multisport activities for triathletes, and others that only come with the Forerunner 265. In the end, you&apos;ll have to decide if you need all of these ancillary features, which would mean upgrading to the Forerunner 265.Â </p>

<p>As should be obvious from reading this review, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">other Garmin Forerunner watches</a> are the best competition to the Forerunner 165.Â </p><p>The Forerunner 255 and 265 cost $100 and $200 more, respectively. The Forerunner 255 gives you Training Status and Load data, plus dual-band GPS tracking and an extra three days of battery life; in exchange, you have to accept an MIP display. The Forerunner 265 has the same features with Training Readiness added, plus a 13-day battery life.Â </p><p>If you want to look outside of Garmin watches, the COROS PACE 3 is the most obvious rival. It costs $20 less, with tools like training plan calendars, post-run training effect, and recovery time that the Forerunner 165 has. Plus, it has the training status and training load data that Garmin restricts, a 24-day battery life, and a similar weight and size. Negatives include its cheap appearance and dull MIP display, along with the fact that it lost to the Forerunner 165 in my accuracy test.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Garmin Forerunner 165 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're a runner who needs personalized workout recs and accurate post-run data.</li><li>You're using a last-gen Forerunner and want a hardware upgrade â but you're happy with the software.</li><li>You can't afford the pricier Forerunners.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Garmin Forerunner 165 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need Training Load data for your training schedule.</li><li>You'd rather prioritize battery life over an AMOLED display.</li></ul>
<p>Since I moved away from New York City and its many running clubs â right in time for a global pandemic â I&apos;ve become more of a solitary, data-driven runner. The Garmin Forerunner 165 checks most of my boxes, mainly with its workout suggestions that take my fatigue, training load, and upcoming races into account.</p><p>Because I tested the Forerunner 265 and 965 first, I&apos;ve become accustomed to seeing my training load data and VO2 Max graph for myself as a benchmark for whether I&apos;m staying on track. But if I&apos;d never used those watches, I wouldn&apos;t know what I was missing. I could simply download a Garmin marathon training plan to my calendar or use Garmin Coach and trust in my effort without needing an algorithm to prove my progress.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 will top my personal list of the best running watches of 2024, but I&apos;d only be able to use it if I took a different philosophical approach to my running. Whether <em>you</em> buy it will depend on the same thing: If you don&apos;t need Training Load, then don&apos;t upsell yourself to a pricier Garmin, and buy the excellent Forerunner 165.</p>

<ul><li>Google previously announced that Podcasts would shut down "after April 2," and the service started to shutter Thursday, April 4.Â </li><li>Both the Android app and web client for Google Podcasts shows a "Google Podcasts is no longer available" pop-up, but the website can still play podcasts for the time being.Â </li><li>YouTube Music will replace Google Podcasts in the Google ecosystem, and users have until July 30 to port their Podcasts data to another platform.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another fan-favorite Google app is shutting down for good, as Google Podcasts is no longer available in the U.S. Google primed users for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shutting-down">the discontinuation of Podcasts</a> for months, saying late last year that the service would be closed "after April 2." Now, as of Thursday, April 4, both the Podcasts app and web client are displaying messages that "Google Podcasts is no longer available."</p><p>The Google Podcasts app for Android doesn&apos;t work anymore and only allows users to export their podcasts or learn more about the shutdown in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/14151168" target="_blank">support document</a>. Though the website shows the same pop-up message, you can close the message and keep using Google Podcasts on the web client for the time being. It&apos;s only a matter of time before Google blocks access to Podcasts altogether, and we won&apos;t count on the website working for much longer.Â </p><p>Google sees <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, the music streaming service that added support for podcasts last year, as the future of podcast distribution for the company. YouTube Music is trying to follow a similar model to Spotify, which hosts podcasts in addition to its main revenue source â music streaming. The general idea is that you&apos;re more likely to subscribe to one of these services if you can get all you need in one place, including music, podcasts, and even audiobooks.Â </p><p>The jury is still out on whether users actually prefer this because many have expressed their disappointment with the decision to kill off Google Podcasts. Having multiple media types in one place might sound like a good idea, but it also makes navigating an app like YouTube Music more difficult.Â </p>

<p>Google Podcast users have the chance to export their data to another service up until July 30, 2024. We have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-google-podcasts-migration-instructions">exporting Google Podcasts data to YouTube Music</a>, as well as one explaining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-migration-tool-available">how to migrate Google Podcasts data to a third-party service</a>. For what it&apos;s worth, people can listen to podcasts on YouTube Music without a subscription. However, the app is still less optimized for podcast distribution than Google Podcast was, lacking features like new episode notifications.Â </p><p>Google is infamous for killing off products and services early and often. After a nearly six-year run, Google Podcasts is now a part of that reputation.</p>

<ul><li>Google may be planning to add an attention-based screen lock setting to Android 15.Â </li><li>The feature is called Adaptive timeout, and it could shorten your device's screen timeout setting if it detects you aren't using your phone.</li><li>It seems like the reverse of Android's existing Screen attention feature, and appears similar to Apple's Attention awareness feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is set to bring a slew of new features and changes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and one subtle change might add a new option for screen timeout settings. Currently, you can pick the duration of time your phone will stay on before timing out and shutting off the display. Additionally, there&apos;s a <strong>Screen attention</strong> feature that will keep your display on longer if you&apos;re looking at it. Starting with Android 15, Google could add a feature that does the opposite.Â </p><p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-adaptive-timeout-3431534/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> noticed strings related to a new <strong>Adaptive timeout </strong>feature in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-developer-preview-2-usb-security">second Android 15 Developer Preview</a>. The strings describe that the setting "automatically turns off your screen early if youâre not using your device" when enabled. Right now, it&apos;s unclear how Android will know when a phone is not being used, but it has to be more than a lack of touch input. As such, it probably uses the same sensing method as the existing Screen attention setting.Â </p><p>Rahman discovered the following strings in the settings app of Android 15 DP2, which hint at the new functionality:</p>
<ul><li><code><string name="contextual_timeout_description">Automatically turns off your screen early if youâre not using your device</string></code></li><li><code><string name="contextual_timeout_title">Adaptive timeout</string></code></li></ul>
<p>Notably, these strings are located under <strong>com.google.*</strong>, and according to Rahman, this means that the Adaptive timeout feature will likely launch as a Pixel exclusive. This tracks with how the Screen attention feature debuted alongside the Pixel 4, and has since expanded to other smartphones.Â </p><p>While there isn&apos;t a direct comparison available today to the possible Adaptive timeout feature Google is working on for Android 15, it sounds similar to a niche iOS feature. iPhones have a settings toggle for <strong>Attention Aware Features</strong>, which causes the phones to react differently when you are looking at them. These features use the TrueDepth sensor, which is also used for Face ID. However, in the case of Android 15, the Adaptive timeout setting will aim to do the reverse â changing how your phone behaves when you are <em>not</em><strong> </strong>looking at it.Â </p><p>Though we don&apos;t know a lot about Adaptive timeout right now, we expect to get a better look at the feature as Google continues to release Android 15 preview builds.Â </p>
