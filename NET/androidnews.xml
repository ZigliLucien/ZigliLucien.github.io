<ul><li>Code within the recent Google Messages beta shows the company's plans to upgrade the app with spam detection for international texts.</li><li>The feature could come in the form of a "Cross-Country" folder, which may function similarly to the current Spam & Blocked bin.</li><li>Google recently rolled out Gemini in Messages to more devices and added texting with 911 through RCS-enabled chats over the summer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A deep dive into Google&apos;s messaging app may hold a few clues about some upcoming extra protection against spam.</p><p>Code in the recent beta build for Google Messages shows the company is working on a "cross-country" spam folder. The unreleased feature has been spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-cross-country-3485507/">Android Authority</a>) in the app&apos;s recent <strong>messages.android_20240923_01_RC00</strong> beta version.</p><p>There are multiple strings within the app&apos;s beta code about this new cross-country folder and its uses. Google&apos;s early description of the function states international messages from "non-contacts" will be placed in a new cross-country "folder."</p><p>However, if you received a message from a person, business, or anyone else, there may be options to move those texts. Messages shows options to shift texts from cross-country to your inbox. Additionally, it seems Google will deliver more insight about the feature through a "why is this message here" button.</p><p>The publication suggests Google could implement different detection parameters for overseas messages to improve its spam detection and avoid false positives. </p>

<p>Spam detection and "prevention" is a feature within Messages called "Spam & Blocked." Texts from senders that the app deems spam-worthy will be tossed into this inbox variant. The app already notifies users of a new message in Spam & Blocked in case it got it wrong, so perhaps we&apos;re looking at something similar for "Cross-Country."</p><p>What&apos;s more, an option in <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Messages > Settings > Spam Protection</strong> lets you toggle this feature on or off. The tipster discovered that Google may give users a toggle for international spam, as well, to keep user agency at play.</p><p>Spam detection for overseas texts is likely taking more time to develop as the tipster didn&apos;t have much to say about its potential launch.</p><p>New happenings in Messages have been relatively quiet aside from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-finally-available-for-more-android-phones-in-messages">Gemini becoming available</a> for more people. The AI model is available in the app for devices with at least 6GB of RAM. Its use and experience mirrors that of the app or web-based version. Gemini in Messages lets users draft ideas, plan an upcoming event, and more.</p><p>Additionally, Google Messages also welcomed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">texting with 911 authorities</a> via RCS-enabled chats.</p>

<ul><li>There are reports that Android 15-based Funtouch OS 15 is hitting devices like the Vivo X100 series, Vivo X Fold 3 Pro, and iQOO 12 ahead of its official September 30 release.</li><li>Vivo’s new update includes cool AI tools like an AI Eraser, a shadow removal tool, and Live Transcribe.</li><li>Traditionally, Google’s Pixel phones get updates first, but there’s been a lack of updates for the Pixel lineup despite Android 15 being available on the AOSP.</li></ul>

<p>Vivo just hit a big milestone by being the first to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to its users, with Funtouch OS 15 now rolling out to a few flagship phones, leaving Google and Samsung in the dust.</p><p>Ishan Agarwal’s scoop on X (formerly Twitter) says Vivo is pushing out the stable version of Funtouch OS 15, based on Android 15, to devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a>, and iQOO 12 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vivo-rolling-out-android-15/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>

<p>Google and Samsung have usually led the charge when it comes to Android updates, with Pixel phones often being the first to get new versions. But even though the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-is-officially-launching-on-pixel-phones-near-you">recently dropped Android 15 to the Android Open Source Project</a>, there’s been a noticeable lack of updates for the Pixel lineup.</p><p>In a surprising twist, some Vivo users have already started receiving the Funtouch OS 15 update a few days ago, even though its official release was set for September 30.</p><p>In theory, any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> brand could&apos;ve pulled off what Vivo did, thanks to Google making the Android 15 source code available on the AOSP at the start of September. This means any company can jump in and start creating their own customized versions of Android 15.</p><p>Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series is on standby for the Android 15 update, which is likely to drop in mid-October. Meanwhile, Samsung hasn’t revealed anything about the One UI 7 beta update.</p><p>Vivo&apos;s Funtouch OS 15 has added several AI-powered tools for its flagship devices, including an AI Eraser in the Gallery that’s expected to work like Google Photos’ Magic Editor, a shadow removal tool, and Live Transcribe.</p><p>The updated software also steps up user privacy and connectivity with new perks like partial screen sharing and satellite connectivity support. The update is being rolled out in phases, so all eligible devices will be getting it over the next few days.</p><p>While the Android 15 beta is out now, it’s not the final version just yet. If Google doesn’t wrap things up quickly, a few more manufacturers might just beat it to delivering stable Android 15 updates on their devices.</p>

<p>Everyone who watched Meta Connect was understandably excited by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses prototype</a>. Still, its most consumer-ready feature had nothing to do with glasses themselves; it&apos;s the electromyography (EMG) band controller for reading neural signals that I expect to see soon on store shelves or in Quest boxes.</p><p>Meta&apos;s EMG tech is too good to be a mere accessory, though; it should be the centerpiece for a Meta watch or tracker. And we already have evidence Meta is working on a watch.</p><p>Anyone who heard Mark Zuckerberg say on stage that Meta&apos;s EMG band allows you to "send a signal from your brain to the device" via a "neural interface" may have gotten visions of some creepy mind-reading tech, but it&apos;s fairly straightforward.</p><p>Right now, a smartwatch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> can detect hand gestures like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">double taps</a> or fists by using the HR monitor and accelerometer/ gyroscope. A VR headset (like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Quest 3S</a>) or AR glasses use computer vision to interpret pinch gestures for hand-tracking controls. Either way, you get missed inputs or false positives.</p><p>An EMG band cuts out the visual or tactile middleman. If you make a pinching gesture, your brain sends a neural signal to your hands to trigger this. The band perceives that you&apos;re pinching your fingers even if they barely move, so tracking errors are unlikely and you don&apos;t have to exaggerate the motion. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-press-photo-1.jpg" alt="Press photo of a woman wearing the Meta Project Orion AR glasses and using the multitasking software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A woman controlling the Project Orion glasses UI with the EMG band </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It worked perfectly well in our hands-on Orion glasses demo, proving EMG isn&apos;t just some gimmick. And there&apos;s no actual brain reading required; it just reads the neural signals in your arm.</p><p>Samsung and Apple love using gestures to make their smartwatches look futuristic and accessible, but I rarely use them on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> because elaborate fist- or wrist-shaking to dismiss calls or open apps feels a bit too finicky and annoying to remember.</p><p>A Meta smartwatch with the right EMG shortcuts would make the big watch brands look amateurish, and allow subtler shortcuts that wouldn&apos;t feel as awkward.</p><p>Such a watch could offer other sensors <em>besides</em> electromyography, too. I&apos;ve thought for years that Meta needs to make a fitness tracker, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3-mixed-reality-is-tailor-made-for-fitness">how popular Quest headsets are for fitness</a>. Quest headsets guess vaguely how many calories you&apos;ve burned based on head and arm movements, but actual heart rate data viewable in-headset during exercise routines would be fantastic. Or imagine if these exercise games could use your live HR data to decide to make the tempo harder or easier.</p><p>The big question, of course, is software. Meta has plenty of iPhone-using fans and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">contentious relationship with Google over XR software</a>; a Wear OS watch is unlikely, in other words. So would a Meta wearable OS without serious mobile integration and third-party apps be viable? Can it catch up for both traditional smarts and fitness training plans to compete in a crowded market?</p><p>I don&apos;t have the answer to those questions, but I know Meta has been working on smartwatch tech on and off for years.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-milan-smartwatch-shelved">canceled its first Project Milan smartwatch prototype</a>. A Bloomberg report revealed that the watch lasted 18 hours per charge, had a 5MP camera mounted to the watch face, and a 12MP camera built into the bottom that you could use by detaching the watch face.</p><p>It had Wi-Fi, LTE, and GPS tracking, as well as "daily activity tracking, workouts, the photo gallery, heart rate monitoring, calendar, settings, and breathing." It had popular Meta apps like Instagram and WhatsApp built in, and cost $349. </p><p>Allegedly, the biggest hang-up Meta had with this prototype was that the bottom camera "caused issues with another feature for translating nerve signals from the wrist into digital commands." In other words, Meta killed the whole project because the EMG tech didn&apos;t work with the design.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23454019/meta-portal-smartwatch-efforts-shutting-down-hardware">The Verge</a>, Meta began working on two new smartwatch prototypes that year. But by November 2022, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-abandoning-smartwatch-portal-development">killed both designs and its Portal smart displays</a> while laying off 11,000 employees.</p>

<p>The following year, we learned from tipster Kamila Wojciechowski that Meta had allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-meta-smartwatch-reportedly-in-development">restarted in-house smartwatch development</a>, using Android software (not Wear OS) and a Qualcomm CPU. The new design had some sensor changes, but may have kept the detachable watch face for taking photos.</p><p>After that, it was mostly radio silence from Meta on the smartwatch front; instead, Zuckerberg bragged about their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-says-neural-interface-controls-are-close-to-ready">new EMG band in a 2024 podcast</a>, saying it would be "in a product in the next few years."</p><p>But last month, leaker Evan Blass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1825260438483075152">posted on X</a> a list of Meta Quest project codenames, and said a source claimed one "may be a watch, I&apos;m told -- the follow up to a killed model codenamed Milan -- while the Vegas are tipped as two generations of budget Quest headsets." The Vega 1 and 2 did turn out to be the 128GB and 256GB Meta Quest 3S, giving this some legitimacy.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick Sutrich asked the Meta Orion team about the possibility of the EMG tech appearing in a smartwatch design, particularly one with fitness capabilities. </p><p>"Right now our focus is on using MEG technology for wearables like smart and AR glasses, but it has the potential to be the best way to control any device," they answered.</p><p>That puts a bit of a damper on my hopes of an EMG-powered smartwatch in the near future. At the moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">The Verge</a>&apos;s sources claim that Meta "will start selling [the EMG band] soon," but for another AR glasses prototype called Hypernova.</p><p>Still, if Meta really is working on a new smartwatch, I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if the EMG band would be its way of standing out from the pack, more than cameras that couldn&apos;t take high-res, on-the-go photos as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta&apos;s own Ray-Ban glasses</a> (or any smartphone).</p><p>The EMG band can still be a standalone controller for smart glasses, but paired with watch tech, it would help Meta start to form its own family of devices like other big tech brands offer.</p>

The new law enforcement sweep, dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">Operation AI Comply</a>, is using existing fair trade and consumer protection laws to target DoNotPay, Ascend Ecom, Ecommerce Empire Builders, FBA Machine, and Rytr charging that these companies use "AI tools to trick, mislead, or defraud people" and makes it clear that AI is not exempt from current laws.</p>

<p>Four of the five cases were unanimous decisions, while the case against Ryter was authorized 3-2, with Commissioners <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-joined-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-matter-rytr">Melissa Holyoak</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/dissenting-statement-commissioner-andrew-n-ferguson-joined-commissioner-melissa-holyoak-matter-rytr">Andrew Ferguson</a> voting against taking action. The FTC makes it very clear it will not tolerate "unfair or deceptive practices in these markets, [and] is ensuring that honest businesses and innovators can get a fair shot and consumers are being protected.”</p>
<p>It&apos;s about time, I say. I&apos;m very familiar with the weirdly inaccurate terms <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-leveraging-machine-learning-make-duo-calls-sound-better">machine learning</a> and AI. I understand the strong points of software that can use one sort of information to present a different sort, and I understand how useful it can be. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">I also hate reading and writing about AI</a> because of its reckless addition to everything and the actual harm it brings.</p><p>I&apos;m not talking about smart robots that destroy humanity or how people with bad intentions can do bad things using AI instead of other tools. I&apos;m talking about how AI can be used to trick even the most tech-savvy among us and how this happens every day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VJ4NvuATz4hoU3GTRAK6H5" name="Google-IO-2023-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Photos AI Magic Editor at Google IO 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJ4NvuATz4hoU3GTRAK6H5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These five cases from the FTC showcase why AI is bad. AI will never replace a living, breathing lawyer, and the claims that it can are simply lies. People who believed those lies were not properly represented when they took it upon themselves to appear in front of judges without an actual attorney.</p><p>AI is not able to build an online storefront that will make you millions. That requires hard work from you and a great idea or a large gift of cash from your parents. AI can write fake reviews for products to try and manipulate potential buyers, but that&apos;s not legal. None of these five businesses have any right to exist because they prey on consumers with bogus promises and deceptive schemes. The FTC says these companies were using AI to "turbocharge deception" and I could not say it any better.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that it took this long for a small sample of offensive companies who used the AI buzzword to steal money from the unsuspecting public. I&apos;d also like to see much harsher penalties, so I guess I have a second complaint.</p><p>I do understand at least part of the problem, though. It seems like everyone is sitting around waiting for some magical AI regulations to happen at the federal level. While waiting, it seemed that nothing was being done using existing laws to weed out the predators. Again, I also realize I&apos;m not a lawyer and have no idea what it takes to build a solid case against a business, and an AI lawyer is very vague on the subject.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.38%;"><img id="nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB" name="AI-lawer.jpg" alt="AI replies are bad." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCBgSvnguYP9iKdTxmZ4EB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We need some common sense federal AI regulations. Not the kind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-ai-bill-makes-companies-liable-for-users">that causes undue levels of bureaucracy</a> and red tape or the kind that stifles honest innovation, but the kind that protects consumers like you and me against deceptive businesses like the ones mentioned by the FTC. I have no idea if that can ever happen with the current level of division between political parties, but I have my doubts. We&apos;ll have to settle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">executive orders</a> in the meantime.</p><p>Until then, using the laws that already exist to protect us from fraud sounds like a grand plan. Deceptive business practices don&apos;t become less deceptive because AI wrote the web page that describes them. The people committing the potential fraud will do it with or without AI, just like people who make fake political ads.</p><p>If we get that sorted out, maybe we can start using AI to do a few good things instead of constantly bickering about how bad it is.</p>

Among these early offers is a discount that slashes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank"><strong>54% off on the Amazon Fire HD 8 (2022) tablet</strong></a>, bringing an already-affordable device down to under $60 — and to its lowest price ever.</p><p>The Fire HD 8 is really nothing special on the performance side, but at this price, it may be a good option for kids or casual users who just want a basic tablet. It&apos;s worth noting that this version comes with lockscreen ads, though it also includes 64GB of storage or 1TB of expandable storage via a microSD slot.</p><p>Even if the Fire HD 8 isn&apos;t quite what you&apos;re looking for, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale"><strong>Amazon&apos;s early deals</strong></a> include a handful of deals on tablets, phones, and other devices. Again, Amazon is also holding its next Big Deal Days sale on October 8th and 9th, which will undoubtedly feature a lot of great tech discounts for Prime members. Haven&apos;t joined up yet? Sign up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon&apos;s 30-day free trial</strong></a> and you&apos;ll enjoy all of the benefits of the sale without paying a dime. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review">2022 Amazon Fire HD 8</a> is an impressive 54% off for a limited time, weeks ahead of the upcoming Prime Day sale. Don't expect a high-performance tablet with this effort from Amazon, but those wanting something cheap and basic certainly won't mind this price point.</p>
<p>This Fire HD 8 includes 64GB of storage and 13 hours of battery life, though it also comes with lockscreen ads.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B09BG56K7R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f06bc46a-a7b3-46c1-87fe-cf7a3c7b2583" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$129.99" data-dimension48="$129.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a casual user looking for a cheap tablet or couch companion; you have other Amazon services that you regularly use; you need a tablet that&apos;s small and lightweight.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a high-performance tablet; you want easy access to more than just what the Amazon App Store has to offer; you need something with fast charging.</p><p>The affordability of the Amazon Fire HD 8 is probably its biggest strength, perhaps even making this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Amazon tablet</a> there is. Despite its performance being pretty basic, it also boasts 13 hours of battery life and easy access to Alexa and the Amazon ecosystem. It&apos;s a great option for kids or those who just need another device around, featuring 2MP cameras, a USB-C port, and easy-to-set parental controls.</p><p>The cons of this cheap Amazon tablet are that it only has 2GB of RAM, so performance is really nothing special, and it doesn&apos;t feature fast charging despite featuring a USB-C port. Still, you&apos;re unlikely to find anything this good at such a low price, and it&apos;s hard to say how long this deal will stick around.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta Connect 2024 had a fun but predictable itinerary: its budget Quest 3S headset, AI tricks, new VR games, and a snazzy new AR glasses prototype. But we also predicted (and hoped) that third-party Meta Horizon OS headsets would appear on stage. They were a no-show, so we asked Mark Rabkin, Meta VP of MR/VR, why.</p><p>Months of leaks made it obvious that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a> would show up at Meta Connect 2024, and Meta itself hinted at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> in the months prior. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-meta-connect-2024">Meta Connect 2024 preview</a> promised they would both get long-awaited reveals.</p><p>We also guessed that we&apos;d see other <em>non</em>-Meta headsets. This spring, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">licensed out the Meta Horizon OS interface</a> to other companies so they could make their own wireless VR headsets with Snapdragon XR2 hardware, Meta&apos;s UI, and the Quest Store library of games and apps.</p><p>Specifically, Meta promised that ASUS ROG would make an "all-new performance gaming headset" running Horizon OS. It also said Lenovo would make "mixed reality devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment" with the same OS. And it promised a "limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox." We&apos;ve yet to hear any news about these headsets in the five months since.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha" name="Meta-Horizon-OS.jpg" alt=""Made with Meta Horizon OS" printed on a box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jqo8RXtFaYPjRMP8oKWha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central&apos;s VR squad, Nick Sutrich and I, hoped to see Meta x Microsoft Quest 3 at Connect. If Meta wants to make the Horizon OS concept take off and attract more hardware developers, we thought it might highlight partners&apos; headsets during its annual showcase alongside the Quest 3S.</p><p>Maybe the ASUS ROG headset would interfere with Quest 3S sales, but we assume it&apos;ll be more of a high-end gaming device for VR superfans compared to the budget 3S for people who found the Quest 3 too expensive. And Lenovo&apos;s productivity headset could have preempted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dont-expect-samsung-xr-headset-galaxy-unpacked-2024">Samsung&apos;s AWOL productivity device</a>.</p><p>Given Meta will probably make its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> with a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 3 before we know it, it makes sense that ASUS ROG and Lenovo would sell these headsets very soon — or have to wait a couple of years for newer hardware. That could make the whole third-party ecosystem lose steam before it can take off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="7EqTS8uMzr7gtNrW8HYZje" name="asus-rog-meta-horizon-os-headset.jpeg" alt="A render mockup of a woman playing a VR game wearing the ASUS ROG VR headset running Meta Horizon OS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7EqTS8uMzr7gtNrW8HYZje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="780" height="439" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta's mock-up for gaming on the ASUS ROG headset. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, why didn&apos;t we see anything from ASUS ROG, Lenovo, or any other partnership announcements? When we asked Meta VP Mark Rabkin, his answer was short and understandably cagey but still very revealing.</p><p>"I don&apos;t have anything I can disclose for now, but we have multiple programs going for those headsets. We&apos;re really trying to let our partners lead the way and have it be their device, their development, their stuff, so we would never push or preempt them, or anything like that," Rabkin said.</p><p>Here&apos;s what I gleaned from this response: (A) Meta stressed that it&apos;s directly supporting these partners on multiple fronts (probably both hardware and software); (B) pushing them to show something off by late September (or any Connect) would be presumptuous and intrusive on whatever they want to do; and (C) Meta probably won&apos;t publicize third-party headsets, the same way Google doesn&apos;t run ads for Samsung phones.</p><p>Our original comparison of Meta Quest as the new "Pixel of VR" feels especially apt. Meta stresses that it&apos;s opening up the ecosystem to other developers, but they&apos;re only partners in the sense that Meta will help other companies get started and charge a licensing fee for the software. It doesn&apos;t own or control these devices, and companies will announce and release them on their own timetable, not Meta&apos;s.</p><p>We&apos;re still hoping to see these headsets soon. With Meta&apos;s main competition being the exorbitant Apple Vision Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either">mostly-abandoned PSVR 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-pico-4-competition">struggling Pico brand</a>, and long-delayed Valve Index successor, it&apos;d be great to see fresh ideas in the VR space while still keeping our Quest libraries and familiar interface.</p>

The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> looks nearly identical to the other phones in the S24 family, with a flat design and triple camera system. The phone features a 6.7-inch display, which means it sits between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Since it&apos;s a Fan Edition phone, the specs aren&apos;t as strong as its siblings. As such, the phone is powered by an Exynos 2400e, which is a low-power version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a> powering certain versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. There&apos;s also 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, and access to features from Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and more.</p><p>On the back is a 50MP primary sensor with a 12MP ultrawide and 8MP 3x telephoto. Keeping the phone on is a 4700mAh battery with 25W wired charging. The phone is available in Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint, and Yellow for $649 in the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to the Galaxy S24 FE, Samsung also launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 series</a>, consisting of the Galaxy S10 Plus and S10 Ultra. The former features a 12.4-inch display, while the latter has a 14.6-inch panel. Samsung switched things up this year, and instead of using a Snapdragon chip, both tablets are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a>. Additionally, both models also support 5G connectivity, making them ideal to use on the go.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra start at $999 and $1199, respectively, and are available for preorder now.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung launched the LTE version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch FE,</a> which was introduced earlier this year.

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg kicked off Meta Connect 2024 by unveiling the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a>, a more affordable version of the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> VR headset. The new model features a similar design with a different lens array up front, and it&apos;s powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 chip. Meta cut costs by using cheaper lenses with lower resolutions and a narrower field of view. It also uses a software-based depth sensor and has a smaller battery, but you should still be able to play the same games as the flagship model.</p><p>The Quest 3S starts at $299 for the 128GB model and also comes in a 256GB model. Meanwhile, the Quest 3 is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-drops-128gb-quest-3-lowers-the-512gb-price-to-a-sweet-dollar499">only available in a 512GB version</a>, which now costs $499, the same as the now-discontinued 128GB model.</p>

<p>Meta also showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses</a>, which are currently in development. The glasses display holographic images over the real world, allowing you to interact with them. The glasses use AI to accurately determine what you&apos;re looking at and help you identify items. You can also do things like video chat with friends or check messages, and even play AR games with others.</p><p>The glasses are larger and thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> but much smaller than other efforts. However, they&apos;re still in development, and it&apos;s unclear when Meta will release them to the public.</p>

However, there have been some issues with the rollout, prompting Google to press pause on the update.</p><p>Some users have been complaining about the update bringing their devices, with one user saying their Pixel Watch 2 was unresponsive after updating, showing only a blank screen with a Bluetooth symbol. One Pixel Watch owner says the update took nearly four hours to complete but functioned just fine when it was done.</p><p>Not everyone experienced problems with the update, but the issues were enough for Google to pull the update while it works out the problems. Meanwhile, affected users can check out this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13575675">support page</a> to hopefully fix their devices.</p>

That means anyone else wishing to access Disney Plus will have to either get their own account or be added on as an extra member for $6.99 a month, at least for a Basic account. Premium members will have to pay $9.99 for an extra account outside their household. It should be noted that account holders can only have one extra member.</p><p>According to Disney, the new policy is available in the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on deceptive AI practices and launched legal action against companies making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">false AI claims</a> or offering tech that can be easily misused for fraud.</p><p>Operation AI Comply, the FTC&apos;s new program, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes" target="_blank">uncovered</a> five cases where companies used AI to boost deceptive practices. These include a so-called "robot lawyer," AI-generated fake reviews, and shady online storefronts.</p><p>One case involves DoNotPay, which claimed to have the “world’s first robot lawyer” that could sue anyone with just a click. Now, the FTC is scrutinizing the company for not following through on its promises.</p><p>DoNotPay offered services like using a virtual card to dodge free trial fees and filing complaints against businesses. However, the FTC claims it exaggerated its capabilities, saying things like users could "sue for assault without a lawyer" and quickly create valid legal documents.</p><p>The FTC has called out DoNotPay for making baseless claims that its &apos;robot lawyers&apos; could replace human lawyers in creating legal documents. DoNotPay had claimed it would "replace the $200 billion-dollar legal industry with artificial intelligence."</p><p>However, the FTC argues that DoNotPay had no evidence to back these claims. As a result, the company has agreed to a $193,000 settlement with the FTC.</p><p>The FTC is also going after companies that claimed AI could help people profit from online storefronts.

<p>Ever since the original iPad was released, I&apos;ve been intrigued and enthralled with the idea of having a slab of glass and metal at my disposal. In most instances, I prefer tablets that are smaller than my laptop but larger than whatever phone I end up carrying that day.</p><p>Before the days of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, this distinction was much easier and is probably why I still adore the Nexus 7. It just served a very distinct purpose and one that couldn&apos;t be served by either my phone or laptop. Unfortunately, we&apos;ve seen a downward trend in device sales across multiple product categories in recent years. However, tablets just experienced a surge that could prove the category is still alive and well.</p><p>Just before attending the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra</a> press event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52611024">a new report</a> from the International Data Corporation (IDC) was released. In this report, the IDC shares that "the tablet market is forecast to grow 7.2% year over year." While that might not seem like much of a jump, it&apos;s actually outpacing PCs, which is expected to "grow 4.3% year over year in 2025." </p>

<p>Considering that there haven&apos;t been many innovations in the tablet space, I&apos;ve been trying to figure out why tablets are seeing a resurgence. There are a couple of different potential explanations for why this is the case, but first, let&apos;s look at why tablet sales suffered in the first place.</p><p>The obvious explanation for the downtrend was the end of the lockdown in 2021, but it&apos;s been three years since then. In that time, there really haven&apos;t been any game-changing device launches outside of the world of foldable phones, which makes the recent surge all the more surprising. After all, tablets remain slabs of glass and either plastic or metal, all with differing software experiences. </p><p>Arguably, Amazon and Google have pushed the envelope a bit further, expanding the capabilities of your tablets by turning them into smart home displays. Meanwhile, Samsung has mostly kept things "business as normal," while Apple still can&apos;t figure out how to implement proper multi-tasking on the extremely overpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-should-think-different-with-ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a> lineup.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-review-1-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 with S Pen back silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXgL486dKccGRiLFvMvLik.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Joe Maring)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, despite this stagnation, why are tablets on the uptick? The first idea that came to mind is that it&apos;s likely been at least two or three years since people last purchased a tablet. That&apos;s a pretty decent upgrade period, somewhat falling in line with getting a new smartphone. </p><p>Another factor here is that Android has matured quite a bit in that timeframe. Not to mention that we didn&apos;t begin seeing the promise of longer software updates for devices until 2022. Samsung now offers seven years of updates, surpassing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>&apos;s three years of major OS upgrades and five years of security patches. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aPuow7pinnUbGJGAdaiLub" name="amazon-fire-7-2022-review-4.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire 7 (2022) with Fire HD 8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPuow7pinnUbGJGAdaiLub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other idea has more to do with the way that I look at tablets, as they can either operate as an extension of my phone or computer or by themselves. Leaning on Samsung again, both the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra can be used as standalone computing devices, even if you don&apos;t take advantage of what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> has to offer.</p><p>These have essentially turned into Android versions of the Microsoft Surface Pro; detachable keyboards and all. While I&apos;m less of a fan of iPadOS now than I once was, it&apos;s definitely possible to be productive, even with a bit less flexibility than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> have to offer. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-dex-mode-classic-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra Using Classic DeX Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjuRAjzVKht95nBPjKqZBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This doesn&apos;t really take Amazon into account, as the majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire Tablets</a> are cheap enough to the point that they&apos;re more stocking stuffers than anything else. Well, at least that&apos;s the idea with the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is the company&apos;s lone non-Kindle premium tablet. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, there&apos;s <em>almost</em> no limit to what can be accomplished. Here are the different combinations that I could think of:</p>
<ul><li>Use the tablet as a tablet, without fiddling with "pro" features.</li><li>With the cellular model, take the Tab S10 Plus anywhere and get work done.</li><li>Use Samsung DeX and enjoy a more desktop-like experience, including being able to plug it into an external display. </li><li>If you own a Galaxy phone, tablet, and laptop, Multi Control lets you use a single keyboard and mouse to interact with your devices.</li><li>Second Screen turns the Galaxy Tab into an external display for any Windows computer.</li><li>With the included S Pen, the Galaxy Tab can transform into a drawing tablet or digital notebook.</li></ul>
<p>I&apos;m sure if I thought about it longer, I could come up with even more things you can do with a flagship Galaxy Tab. But I think you get the idea.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve also been wondering why Samsung would opt to ditch the smaller 11-inch model of its flagship tablet lineup. If you&apos;ll notice, there is no base Galaxy Tab S10, just the Plus and Ultra. Just last year, the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab S9</a> finally gained an OLED display while offering decent battery life and top-shelf performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was something I really couldn&apos;t figure out until I looked at the other Galaxy Tabs that are currently available. I&apos;m not sure if Samsung will keep the Galaxy Tab S9 lineup around, but at the time of this writing, all three models can still be purchased. </p><p>Moving further down Samsung&apos;s price bracket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</a> and its 12.4-inch screen retail for $599, while the 10.9-inch Tab S9 FE is $449. The Galaxy Tab A9 Plus rounds out the pack with an 11-inch display and a $319 price tag. </p><p>Admittedly, it does leave a rather large gap, seeing as the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus starts at $999. What I suspect is that the Galaxy Tab S9 will remain in the lineup, offering an option to those who want the best performance in a smaller form factor. But if you want the latest and the greatest, then you&apos;re probably okay with paying more and getting larger screens. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ" name="oneplus-pad-2-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with keyboard accessory next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&apos;ve been primarily focusing on Samsung tablets, the reality is that there are definitely more options to choose from that don&apos;t just suck. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a> was the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 tablet, while the rather interesting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet</a> is slated to be released in mid-October.</p><p>Lenovo has its own massive lineup of tablets to choose from, ranging from the Tab M8 for $99 and maxing out with the Tab Extreme at $1,099. Currently, there are nine different Lenovo tablets to choose from, coming in a variety of sizes and slotting in amongst the various price brackets. </p><p>This is to say that maybe the reason there&apos;s a resurgence in tablet sales has to do with the sheer number of solid options available. If you want to be productive, then there&apos;s the iPad Pro, Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-tab-extreme-will-challenge-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra" target="_blank">Lenovo Tab Extreme</a>. Need something on a budget but not at the bottom of a barrel? Well, you have an almost never-ending stream of options. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP" name="google-pixel-tablet-home-assistant-dashboard.jpg" alt="Home Assistant Dashboard on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HPQpanRc6kHcuRNCZodKP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon manages to straddle a few categories of its own, such as turning a Fire Tab into an Alexa smart display. While I do hope to see a refresh, you can either let the Pixel Tablet pull double duty as a smart home hub or use a regular Google tablet if you forgo the dock.</p><p>Regardless of the actual reason, if there is one, I&apos;m happy to see tablets getting a bit of the spotlight, especially when other categories of devices are slowing to a crawl. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Meta held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/what-to-expect-meta-connect-2024">yearly developer conference</a> and surprise — a big focus was placed on AI. It will be introducing features that resemble what we see from other tech companies with improved voice recognition, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">photo scanning</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">live translation</a> as some of the highlights.</p><p>It sounds a lot like what we see from Google. It&apos;s also the same potential privacy nightmare and abuse of consumer data that applies to the same tools from Google. And it will be presented the very same way through the terms of service you are forced to agree with to use the products.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/read-the-fine-print">said this over and over</a> and others have, too. You have to read the things you&apos;re agreeing to. Especially this time.</p><p>I&apos;m not a fan of big tech or its fascination with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">intrusive AI</a>. Amazon, Google, Apple, OpenAI, and the rest have their best interests in mind and try to provide services you want to use so they can profit from the user data you supply. That&apos;s why features are presented the way they are and try to entice you into using them.</p>
<p>That&apos;s fine if there&apos;s mutual benefit, and only you get to decide that. I always use myself as an example; I use Google&apos;s products and services.</p>

<p>I hate the amount of data Google collects and don&apos;t like everything the company does with it. In return, I get to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">products I find useful</a>. I&apos;d much rather pay real money to use these products and skip the excessive data collection, but that&apos;s not an option. I opt out of anything that doesn&apos;t interest me and begrudgingly allow the rest because I benefit.</p><p>Plenty of folks don&apos;t feel this way and try not to use Google&apos;s products, and I don&apos;t use Amazon&apos;s (for example) because the benefits aren&apos;t there for me. Nobody is right or wrong here because we each get to decide for ourselves.</p>
<p>You have to make an informed decision, though. It&apos;s foolish to think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-cant-trust-facebook">a company like Meta</a> has developed and released these features for free out of kindness or philopatry. Meta may not want to harm society, but it cares most about how the company itself will benefit.</p><p>No company will risk stealing user data and abusing it without permission. Even when done inadvertently there are often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tracking-private-incognito-browsing-lawsuit-proceeding">brutal punishments</a> doled out by the courts for breach of trust issues. And there should be. Everything Meta collects and everything it does with it once collected is written in the terms and conditions for you to read. If you agree, you have given your blessing.</p>
<p>The one thing here that&apos;s a little different is the language used in those terms. To their credit, Google and Apple use language that&apos;s easy to understand when it comes to company policy, and Microsoft is getting there. We should remember that when we decide what tech ecosystem to buy into. I know I do because this means a lot and promotes a level of trust.</p><p>Meta is not on this list. Meta has a bad habit of writing difficult-to-understand policy documents and hiding them behind links to other documents. Long-time users of Meta products like Facebook will also remember how any updates reset all your privacy features. To return them to work the way you wanted meant you needed to go through them page by page. The company was hoping you wouldn&apos;t bother.</p>
<p>I&apos;m sure that Meta understands what this looks like to consumers. I&apos;m equally sure the company doesn&apos;t care because it knows almost everyone will click or tap the button that says "I agree" and allow them to do whatever they like.</p><p>I&apos;m saying you shouldn&apos;t. The articles you read about how bad Meta&apos;s AI features are from a privacy perspective often leave this important detail out. They&apos;re only bad if you want them to be, just like Google&apos;s, Apple&apos;s, or Amazon&apos;s.</p>
