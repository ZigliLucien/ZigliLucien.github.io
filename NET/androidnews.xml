<hr>
<p>Smartphone sales have finally shot up after a two-year slump. According to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-research-notes-blogs-smartphone-market-recovers-in-2024-after-two-years-of-decline/" target="_blank">report</a> by Counterpoint, the sales of smartphones grew by 4% YoY (33%) in 2024 when compared to the previous year.</p><p>As for what brought in the sudden shift in the numbers, Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research, contributed to overall economic growth in Europe, China, and Latin America, meaning more people could afford to buy new phones.</p><p>"The smartphone market started showing signs of recovery from Q4 2023 and has now grown for five consecutive quarters," Pathak added in the report.</p><p>Xiaomi, even though it came third, took the lead as the fastest-growing smartphone brand among the top five in 2024, with an overall growth of 12% when compared to the previous year. The report stated that this growth was solely due to the company's "portfolio realignment, premium push, and aggressive expansion activities."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.43%;"><img id="S5ES442LFyz8HvLvSP2Bhn" name="Smartphone-sales-2024" alt="Table shows smartphone sales YoY 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S5ES442LFyz8HvLvSP2Bhn.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="985" height="674" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CounterPoint)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Samsung, the company did see a 1% fall in its overall sales but continued to lead (19% overall sales) the market in 2024. Samsung got to stick around at the top, thanks to the rising demand for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">S24 series</a>, especially in the USA and Western Europe. Part of it was because the S24 was the company's first flagship to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, bringing in a host of new capabilities, helping it "outperform its predecessors." It remains to be seen how much the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> could bump up Samsung sales this year.</p><p>Taking second place is Apple,  with 18% of the share coming from Apple’s iPhone 16 series. The report further added that this series was met with mixed reactions due to the lack of Apple intelligence at the launch. Nevertheless, it did see enough growth in non-core markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific to score second place.</p>
<p>OPPO took fourth place, with an 8% YoY decline, and Vivo, even though it took fifth place, ended the year on a high note as the top-ranked OEM in India and China. Huawei, HONOR, and Motorola were ranked among the fastest-growing OEMs among all the top 10 brands.</p><p>The past year also saw the rollout of more generative AI (Gen AI) in smartphones— limited mostly to higher-end phones. However, Counterpoint Research predicts that by 2028, nine out of 10 smartphones over $250 (mid-range) will have Gen AI built into them.</p><p>As for how the market could look in 2025, the report says that despite numbers possibly never matching pre-pandemic times, "revenue growth is set to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8% YoY, compared to 4% volume growth."</p>

<ul><li>A report claims to have spotted Motorola's next clamshell foldable, the Razr 60 Ultra (AKA the Razr Plus 2025).</li><li>The BIS certification listing didn't open up any specs; however, it's early listing leaves speculation to suggest an earlier launch for Motorola in April.</li><li>The device is also rumored to feature the alleged Snapdragon 8s Elite, which recently had its toned-down core setup leaked.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New Year, new wave of phones; and a recent leak might've caught Motorola's next foldable earlier than usual.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/possible-motorola-razr-60-ultra-bis-certified-launch-india/">91Mobiles</a>, a phone was spotted moving through the BIS database in India, which the publication speculates is the "Razr 60 Ultra" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/motorola-razr-60-ultra-closer-to-launch-certification.html">Android Headlines</a>). The post notes that the device was spotted with the model number <strong>XT2551</strong>, which could give credit to this rumor of it being the next Razr Plus for 2025.</p><p>Last year's model received XT2451, so it seems that Motorola has taken that third number up a level to indicate the next generation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the leaks end there, but it does create quite a curious situation as things are seemingly occurring in reverse order.</p>

<p>Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">a rendering</a> of the Razr 50 Ultra, otherwise known as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> in the U.S., surfaced. This was then followed up by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-aka-razr-plus-2024-live-image">set of live images</a> of the device as it moved through the standard certification databases. These events took place in January before a drought until April and May ahead of its official reveal that summer in July.</p><p>More importantly, it's worth noting that the time difference between the phone's BIS appearance and launch was three months.</p><p>The publication also noted that, suggesting that the Razr 60 Ultra (or the Razr Plus 2025) could see a much earlier launch. <em>If </em>— and it's a big if — this device is the next Motorola clamshell foldable, then we <em>could </em>be looking at an April release instead of a summer bash.</p><p>Right now, all of this is speculation, so it's wise to take things with a grain of salt as nothing further has been discovered/purported.</p><p>The publication also speculates that the phone could leverage Qualcomm's recently rumored "Snapdragon 8s Elite" since its predecessor uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>. Speaking of the rumored 8s Elite, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">its latest leak</a> might've put its core configuration into a toned-down perspective.</p><p>A Weibo tipster claims the chip could grab the same 1+3+2+2 config as the old flagship 8 Gen 3. Moreover, it could feature one Prime core at 3.21GHz. The current line of rumors says the chip will be weaker than the 8 Elite and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which lines up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">with ones from December</a>.</p><p>Tipsters purport the 8s Elite could debut sometime in Q1 2025.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims that Qualcomm is starting to test its alleged "Snapdragon 8s Elite" and its core setup has supposedly been leaked.</li><li>The chip may arrive with a 1+3+2+2 array like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with one Prime core at 3.21GHz.</li><li>Again, rumors claim the chip is eyeing the more affordable/cheap line up of phones and could debut during Q1 2025 with iQOO and Redmi.</li><li>A previous leak about the 8s Elite from December doubles down on what we've heard now, as well as its assumed model number.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Our typical top-of-the-line flagships received the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but Qualcomm is reportedly working on a lesser-strength twin.</p><p>Rumors about such a reduced-powered SoC stem from Digital Chat Station (DCS) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/P9n8Zy7UB">on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-leaked-specs-3516209/">Android Authority</a>). According to the leak, the tipster claims the new chip will be called the "Snapdragon 8s Elite" and it <em>could </em>see a 1+3+2+2 core configuration.</p><p>DCS went into those alleged specs, stating the SoC could see one core — which is speculated to be a Prime core — at 3.21GHz.</p><p>The post adds that the 8s Elite could hold three cores at 3.01GHz, two cores at 2.80GHz, and two additional cores at 2.02GHz. DCS purports that the 8s Elite will be joined by the Adreno 825 GPU. Interestingly, the alleged 8s Elite has already gone through Geekbench for performance scoring.</p><p>DCS states the early power specifications show that the chip achieved a score of 1,967 for its single-core and 5,827 during the multi-core stage. For context, the tipster compared it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> from 2023, which achieved 2,200 and 7,000 scores, respectively.</p>

<p>Curiously, this isn't the first time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8s-elite-power-changes-rumored">we've heard rumors</a> suggesting the "8s Elite" will be weaker than the 8 Elite <em>and </em>the 8 Gen 3. In December, DCS stated such a fact, accompanied by a leak by another tipster on X. With that, it seems likely that the chip could be for 2025's midrange devices instead of those of a higher tier. Those rumors also claimed the chip contained the model number SM8735 and would be purely "based on ARM" and not Qualcomm's newest Oryon cores.</p><p>Those old rumors also speculated on the chip's release, which could fall somewhere within Q1 2025 (no later than March). DCS' recent leak states the chip could appear on the upcoming iQOO and Redmi phones, which may line up with this assumed Q1 release.</p><p>The same Weibo tipster floated the theory that this upcoming flagship chip variant could push phones to pack ~7,000mAh batteries.

All things said and done, the promotion offers a value of nearly $125. Considering that the VR headset usually costs $399.99 for the 256GB configuration, that&apos;s a significant chunk of change! </p>

<p>For a limited time, Best Buy (and some other retailers) are dropping $50 off the Meta Quest 3S 256GB, knocking the price of the midrange headset down to $349.99. </p>
<p>As a bonus, you'll still get to enjoy the other freebies that usually come with a Meta Quest purchase, such as three free months of a Meta Quest Plus subscription and a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow. This deal won't last long, so I'd act fast if you're interested. </p>

<p>Like I mentioned above, your purchase will come with three free months of Meta Quest Plus (usually $7.99 per month).

The headset boasts many of the same great features found in the regular Meta Quest 3 — such as identical Snapdragon processors, mixed reality specs, and 8GB of RAM — just in a more-affordable package. </p><p>You also get access to all of the same games, albeit at a slightly lower resolution. Comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Quest 3S vs. the Quest 3</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the more-affordable headset doesn&apos;t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the field of view is a bit narrower, but are these small drawbacks enough to justify spending another $150 on a Meta Quest 3? The choice is yours, but if you&apos;re looking to try one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> at a reasonable price point, this deal is worth considering. </p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit have started reporting that Google is pushing its dual SIM RCS support in Messages via a new stable version.</li><li>Threads state that the feature is appearing on several Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy devices in the U.S., Canada, and Germany.</li><li>Reports from last fall showed that Google was likely extending its testing of the feature as very few users spotted it in beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Google's next step in messaging for its U.S. users is seeing a proper rollout in January.</p><p>Highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-widespread-rollout/">Android Police</a>, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/finally/?rdt=46566">on Reddit</a> have started a thread about the arrival of Dual SIM support for RCS texting in Google Messages. The O.P. (original poster) states they've received dual SIM over RCS support in Messages on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. Another user chimed in, stating they've also received support for it, which involves using both SIMs "simultaneously."</p><p>That particular post added that their device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/comment/m70jp07/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">is not enrolled in the beta</a> and has appeared in version messages.android_20241120_00_RC07 of the Messages app.</p><p>Several more posts say the dual SIM support has rolled onto the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Moreover, users have mentioned the feature delivering support for SIM cards belonging to Verizon, AT&T, and USMobile.</p><p>Elsewhere, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/13/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs/">9to5Google</a> post doubled down on user reports on Reddit regarding its stable app version release. The publication also highlighted other threads that claim the feature is even appearing for more users in the most recent Messages beta, v20250112_00_RC00. Additionally, users outside of the U.S. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0poju/dualsim_now_active/">have reportedly noticed support</a> appearing on Android, which signals an even wider rollout than originally theorized.</p><p>A user with a Galaxy S23 FE in Canada posted a screenshot of the feature's arrival on their device, as well as another in Germany.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1i0nhgx/finally">FINALLY!!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Google has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-us-rollout">slowly moving toward</a> its official push for dual SIM support for RCS texting since last fall. There was a more secluded beta earlier last year; however, some users started noticing it quite sparingly in November. The reports were sporadic as some saw it on stable while others only spotted it in its beta version.</p><p>Regardless, seeing as it's more apparent in January, users should notice the dual SIM feature in the RCS Chats page of the Messages app settings. There, beneath "turn on RCS," users will notice both SIM cards alongside two checkboxes. Users can decide which card to use at any given moment or have them both active at once.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that there are some routine verification steps the cards must go through in the app before everything's green.</p><p>Outside of RCS, Google recently detailed the addition of more AI software in Messages to help users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">combat spam/tricky scam texts</a>. If the app detects a potential sign of spam, it will either automatically drop it in the appropriate folder or alert you about it for better judgment.</p>

<p>The flagship OnePlus 13 and the OnePlus 13R <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">debuted </a>last week globally. Both OnePlus phones have already started getting their first notable updates.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R, which launched with Android 15-based OxygenOS 15, has started receiving its first OxygenOS 15.0.0.403 update for the regions including India, Europe, and North America with corresponding build numbers <strong>CPH2691_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>, <strong>CPH2645_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>, and <strong>CPH2647_15.0.0.403(EX01)</strong>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> at Android Central has also started getting the <strong>CPH2655_15.0.0.402(EX01)</strong> build number. Per the corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1770667430310313986">community post</a> regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, it is an incremental rollout being rolled out in batches. If you are already on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handset</a>, expect it as soon as the rollout has just begun over the weekend.</p><p>The exclusive features included in the OnePlus 13 are new AI features to Google Messages, and according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1878870834254627193">Mishaal Rahman's findings</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-13-gemini-nano-3516037/">Android Authority</a>), evidently it is the inclusion of Gemini Nano. The firmware update for the handset in the U.S. brings a corresponding Android AICore app, which is required to download the AI model.</p>

<p>The Google Messages on the OnePlus 13 will now have the new Magic Compose button, which is an experimental feature that utilizes generative AI to provide suggested replies, per the conversation in the respective chat.</p><p>According to the full changelog posted by OnePlus, the latest firmware for the OnePlus 13R shares some common things with the OnePlus 13 firmware update. It includes a new feature for the photos, which introduces personalized watermarks.</p><p>Like Android's Quick Share, the OnePlus 13 and the 13R have a Touch to-share feature, which now supports iOS devices with the new update. Sharing files and photos to other devices could be a lot better after the update.</p>
<p>Both phone users will see several improvements when it comes to shots captured through Photo mode. The shots taken through both handsets' primary camera and telephoto lens should look better, as color enhancements are included in the update.</p><p>Additionally, for the OnePlus 13, the improvements can be seen in the clarity of 4K videos at 60fps. A fix is also included for photos getting too bright while captured in rear camera mode — on both the OnePlus 13 and 13R.</p>
<p>Other notable improvements include the stability of Wi-Fi connections and connections made through Bluetooth. For a better user experience, the company is also adding charging status to Live Alerts on both handsets. Both firmwares carry the December 2024 Android security patch, and the latest release offers improvements across system stability and performance.</p><p>Other nifty features on the OnePlus 13 include the ability to add a new Weather widget in 1 x 2 size to the home screen, and other enhancements can be seen across the step tracker and storage cleaner widgets. The flagship OnePlus 13 also improves audio quality.</p>

<hr>
<p>We're just two weeks into 2025, and Motorola is dropping its first phones of the year. The Moto G Power 2025 and Moto G 2025 (which now omit the "5G" from their names) are the company's latest budget devices for anyone not looking to spend too much on a smartphone, and both come with colorful designs and large batteries.</p><p>Reading the duo is the Moto G Power 2025, which sports a 6.8-inch FHD+ LCD panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. Departing from last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> a bit, the design more closely resembles the rest of Motorola's lineup with a seamless vegan leather back that covers the 50MP triple camera array.</p><p>The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, which is a slight downgrade from last year's chip. Still, performance should prove adequate, and the difference will likely be negligible, especially with the 8GB of RAM on board. The phone also runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with features like audio sharing, enhanced accessibility, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yvxjNxKG5rhHhBZiHe7PST" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-official-render-leaf-green" alt="Official render of the Moto G Power 2025 in Leaf Green" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvxjNxKG5rhHhBZiHe7PST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Underneath it all is a 5,000mAh battery, which Motorola says should enable all-day battery life. There's also 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.</p><p>Motorola is also stepping up its protection for the Moto G Power 2025, with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protecting the display. The phone also sports MIL-STD-810H certification and IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> — the first we've seen on a Motorola phone at this price point. This means the phone can withstand being submerged and should be able to hold out when facing high-pressure water jets.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 comes in Slate Gray and a rather striking Leaf Green and will be available starting February 6 for $299 unlocked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3168px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w4sALpTLZ8Dqmsd6ZsoAmU" name="Moto-G-2025-Sapphire-Blue" alt="The Moto G 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w4sALpTLZ8Dqmsd6ZsoAmU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3168" height="1782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto G 2025 is Sapphire Blue. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G 2025 is a step down from the Power. It features a slightly smaller 6.7-inch display and the same Dimensity 6300 chipset, which seems pretty comparable to the Snapdragon chip powering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">last year's model</a>. The difference between this and the Power 2025 is the lower 4 or 6GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of expandable storage (compared to 256GB).</p><p>The Power 2025 comes with an 8MP ultrawide camera, while the Moto G 2025 sports a 2MP macro sensor. Both have ambient light sensors.</p><p>The Moto G 2025 gets a 5,000mAh battery and upgraded charging speeds up to 30W when compared to its predecessor, although it misses out on wireless charging. Protection also isn't as robust with Gorilla Glass 3 over the display and IP52 water and dust resistance.</p><p>However, just like the Power 2025, the Moto G 2025 sports a vegan leather finish on the back and comes in Forest Gray and Sapphire Blue. It will be available starting January 30 for $199.</p>

It is the successor to the Xiaomi Pad 6, launched in 2023 in Indian and global markets.</p><p>The latest Pad 7 looks very familiar in design compared to its predecessor, even in colorways; a new Green color is added, while the previous Gray and Purple remain intact. The Pad 7 is slightly thinner than the previous iteration, measuring 6.18mm, while the display measures 11.2 inches, almost similar to the Pad 6.</p>

<p>It incorporates an LCD panel with a 3:2 aspect ratio (3200 x 2136 resolution) and a 144Hz refresh rate. It further features Full DC Dimming and is TÜV Rheinland Flicker Free Certified. Xiaomi notes that it is a nano texture display that makes it glare-free and reduces screen reflectivity. For protection, the display also includes Gorilla Glass 3 on top.</p><p>Underneath, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3</a> SoC with clock speeds of up to 2.8GHz. Storage options include up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. The tablet also incorporates a four-speaker setup with support for Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res & Hi-Res Wireless Audio.</p>
<p>The camera setup is essentially the same, with a 13MP primary camera and an 8MP selfie shooter. The device has a large 8850mAh battery capacity, and this time, Xiaomi has bumped up the charging speeds to 45W fast charging. Other highlights of the Pad 7 tablet include support for Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.4, and the Android 15-based Xiaomi Hyper OS 2 operating system.</p><p>In terms of AI, the Xiaomi Pad 7 supports AI Writing, AI Live Subtitles, and Xiaomi Creation. The company notes that these features need a subsequent OTA upgrade, which is expected to arrive next month.</p>
<p>The company also provides notable accessories for the Xiaomi Pad 7, including a protective cover, the Xiaomi Pad 7 Focus Pen, and the Focus Keyboard. While the Pad 6 was offered in both LTE and Wi-Fi models, the Pad 7 is currently available for sale in a standard version in the Indian market. It starts at Rs 27,999 (~$324) for the 8GB+128GB storage and retails at Rs 30,999 (~$358) for the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage variant.</p>

<p>Does Anker ever miss? Apparently it doesn't, because the charging accessories brand has been killing it lately. The brand always has something cool up its sleeves. This time, it's the excellent Anker Nano 75W Car Charger.</p><p>Anker has found a neat way to improve the humble car charger. Most car chargers that plug into the auxiliary power outlet are cheap and compact. They usually come with either USB-C or USB-A ports, or sometimes a mix of both. The Nano 75W Car Charger has two Type-C ports, but what's fascinating is that one of the ports has a built-in retractable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a>.</p><p>Anker is calling this non-removable cable the InstaCord. It's a standard USB Type-C cable with a flat fettuccine-like shape. The cable pulls out and measures 29.5 inches in length. Once it's out, a second tug makes it roll back into the charger automatically.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2762px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TwqtcjS6wtZABmYLAFSt8G" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TwqtcjS6wtZABmYLAFSt8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2762" height="1554" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The retractable cable leaves only one other port free, but I think that's just fine. This is such a smart way to reduce the clutter of cables in your vehicle. I hate having wires lying around and getting trampled on in the car. Unplugging and replugging them constantly is another hassle. So, having a cable that takes no space whatsoever is an ingenious solution!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3475px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="XFqzKfDXv4npf5mJMJ3Z8G" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFqzKfDXv4npf5mJMJ3Z8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3475" height="1955" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of all the weird and wonderful cables I've tested, this retractable charging cable is one of the best ones. You might think the non-removable factor would be an issue, but I had zero issues with this while testing the Nano 75W Car Charger.</p><p>A car or vehicle doesn't require you to unplug and reuse your cable anywhere else anyway, unlike at home or at your workplace, where you might need your cable to be removable so you can use it elsewhere.</p><p>Anker promises at least 10,000 safe retractions with the Type-C InstaCord and over 12,000 swings, so it should last a while. I've used it for about two weeks, and the cable still looks and feels as good as new.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qbeSVBW69RFrnFrDVfUcG" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qbeSVBW69RFrnFrDVfUcG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally, standard car chargers are rated around 40W to 50W. The Anker Nano 75W Car Charger packs a mightier punch at 75W, so you can fast charge not just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablets</a>, and accessories but also larger mobile devices like laptops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> at max speeds on the go.</p><p>When both ports are in use at the same time, you get 45W from the retractable InstaCord and 30W from the other USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HSKdubz9rBnLjXBF6ySKbG" name="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger" alt="Anker Nano 75W Car Charger inside a car" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSKdubz9rBnLjXBF6ySKbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I do wish the InstaCord was a bit longer than 29.5 inches, though, because depending on the size of your car, the passengers in the backseats may not find it long enough to use comfortably.</p><p>Apart from that, the design is impeccable. Who needs more than two ports in a moving vehicle? On top of that, 75W is a lot of power, even when split between two ports.</p><p>Everything wraps up nicely once you look at the retail price of the Anker Nano 75W Car Charger. This thing costs only $29.99, which is fabulous considering you basically get a two-for-one deal with this product. Sure, there are cheaper car chargers at Amazon or Walmart, but they don't come with a cable built-in, and neither do they have 75W of power output.</p><p>So, if you need a car charger that fits into the auxiliary power outlet of your automobile, stop looking and buy the Anker Nano 75W Car Charger. It's the best car charger available right now.</p>

Samsung launched the phone with a newly minted flat display, a unique anti-glare layer on the screen, a stronger titanium frame, and a stronger software update guarantee than ever.</p><p>At launch, it was clear what Samsung would need to do to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> a better phone. But while 2024's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best premium phone</a> launched strong, nagging issues crept up throughout the year.</p><p>The fancy new display was found to suffer from some strange quality and configuration issues, and some build quality issues with the glass have crept up after a few months of use. Samsung's Android 15 update was delayed several times, and while we're already on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">One UI 7 beta 3</a>, the final version isn't expected until at least sometime in late January at the earliest.</p><p>One UI 7 has also been the source of much criticism and, funny enough, praise due to some major UI design changes. But while One UI 7's new design doesn't seem to be everyone's cup of tea, Samsung is delivering some major improvements for the S24 Ultra that will ultimately please fans in the end, especially as the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> series approaches.</p>

<p>Ever since the Galaxy S24 Ultra's launch, users have been complaining about the display. Whether it was the graininess of the pixels or the permanent smudges that have started appearing on some people's phone displays, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's display has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">a bit of a disappointment</a>.</p><p>Complaints have revolved around a few problems, some of which can be considered major given the high price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra. All Galaxy S24 Ultra units <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">are affected by mura</a>, which means that each pixel isn't reaching the same brightness level as adjacent pixels. This doesn't just happen at high brightness, and it exposes a quality downgrade we didn't expect to see in a Samsung flagship.</p><p>We've also seen several instances of people getting permanent "smudges" on their screens. Based on several examples, it seems like it's the result of the oleophobic layer rubbing off prematurely. There's no way to fix this if it happens outside of replacing the outer glass entirely, so it's best to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">put a screen protector on it</a> as soon as you unbox it to prevent this issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-smudgy-screen" alt="Smudges on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung might have fixed the dull screen issue about a month after launch but the company is still seeing complaints of reduced display brightness and color banding across social media. Some of the brightness issues have to do with thermal management, as the phone tones down the brightness after a few minutes to keep it from getting hot.</p><p>However, the biggest issue is that Samsung artificially reduces the maximum brightness by using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. This dimming method helps increase color accuracy on OLEDs at low brightness but Samsung is using it at all brightness levels for an unknown reason. Using PWM dimming at high brightness reduces the perceived brightness level of the display, something Samsung could fix it it offered a proper PWM-free dimming mode as rivals like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> do.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S24 Ultra's display has been the center of user complaints about the phone, ranging from display quality to early wear and tear on the glass.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>We've also seen several reports of users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1aglx09/s24_ultra_scratch_resistance_is_awful/">on Reddit</a> getting micro scratches on their displays despite claiming to be careful with their phones. Smartphone glass has evolved a lot over the years, but there seems to be something different about the glass used on the S24 Ultra. My unit also has a few micro scratches despite it not being my main phone throughout the year.</p><p>Every time I've used the Galaxy S24 Ultra over the past year, I've had issues using the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. While some folks prefer ultrasonic sensors, people like myself find them to be less reliable than optical sensors, especially when a screen protector is applied. Thankfully, the upcoming One UI 7 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-might-have-faster-fingerprint-unlocks-with-one-ui-7-beta">addresses concerns</a> of fingerprint sensor speed and accuracy and, so far in my testing, has made it substantially more reliable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bbBhSiwX97RD7qzGHxbzGm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-with-oneplus-12-and-google-pixel-9" alt="Customizing the lockscreen on a Galaxy S24 Ultra with a green AI-generated wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bbBhSiwX97RD7qzGHxbzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you love the square corners of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, you might want to hold on to the phone for as long as possible as Samsung is said to be rounding them off with future phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But while the display might not be the best thing in the world, Samsung's design and build quality of the S24 Ultra's remaining hardware has shone through. The titanium frame has received plenty of praise and holds up well with use, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Minor-Scratches-on-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Titanium-Frame-Titanium/td-p/16200852">a few users</a> have found that certain cases can scratch the frame. It's strange, for sure, but something to look out for if you're still rocking a pristine Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>While Samsung has been using <em>very square</em> corners on the Galaxy S Ultra line since the Galaxy S22, rumor has it that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> will do away with these for more rounded corners. Despite rounding out the corners, Samsung is reportedly making the sides of the phone completely flat all around.</p><p>This design would match that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24</a> which received the flat treatment last year. Personally, I hate the flat side rail design and would rather see Samsung keep the curved sides from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which are much nicer to hold and make it easier to pick the phone up from a table or other flat surface.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-split-notification-shade" alt="The new split notification pane on One UI 7 beta 2 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpGswcHfE36tUgcaFkrEF6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra arrived with the first seven-year update promise Samsung has ever made for its phones. While that sounds nice on paper, Samsung will be roughly four months late in delivering its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> update by the time One UI 7 finally makes its public debut.</p><p>Android 15 certainly isn't the biggest update in the world but One UI 7 looks to be worth the wait. I tried out the second One UI 7 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">back in December</a> and was generally impressed with what I saw. Samsung <em>finally</em> ditched the age-old paginated app drawer for a vertical app drawer by default, although you can switch back to the old style if you prefer that.</p><p>The company is also using a new design for its multitasking interface that looks almost identical to an iPhone. Some people might not be happy with the change for this reason, but it's far more practical than the awful old side-by-side design. This design makes it easier to quickly multitask as you can "peak" at the next few apps while scrolling through the tiles while the previous design only showed one app's tile at a time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7GZMDwezjKoxMi77GUAjBU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-one-ui-7-multitasking-02" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7GZMDwezjKoxMi77GUAjBU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is also borrowing Apple's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">split notification pane design</a>, making it so that the phone's notification pane only appears when swiping down on the left side of the status bar, while swiping down on the right side brings up a full-screen quick toggles pane. This design is polarizing as it's contrary to standard Android design, but some folks prefer the larger quick toggles pane to be the default.</p><p>Regardless of your preference, nearly everything can be customized out of the box to suit your preferences. The only exception, for now, is the multitasking interface, which usually requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Samsung Good Lock</a> to change. Thankfully, Samsung is said to be giving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">Good Lock a total overhaul</a> when One UI 7 officially launches later this month, so you should be able to change it if you're not a fan of the new design (or like one of the many alternatives Samsung has always offered).</p><p>Samsung's real strength has long been offering something for everyone, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra's software experience perfectly embodies that mantra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-performance-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Performance and battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cUHxa7bj5cGp8nq2nL6pNg" name="Samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-performance-benchmark" alt="Running a performance benchmark on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUHxa7bj5cGp8nq2nL6pNg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-galaxy-s24-support-ray-tracing">when Samsung announced it</a> last year, ray-tracing on phones hasn't caught on yet. Diablo Immortal launched its big ray-tracing update, but we haven't seen a huge push for using this technology on phones, presumably due to battery life and performance constraints that phones uniquely face when compared to consoles or PCs that push the same tech.</p><p>Overall, though, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra still delivers stellar real-world performance. Newer phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> significantly outpace it in terms of performance and thermal limits, but that's fully expected from a new generation. For its part, the Galaxy S24 Ultra never feels sluggish, but Samsung tends to throttle brightness quite a bit when the phone starts to get warm.</p><p>This keeps performance high and prevents the phone from overheating, but it's annoying to have to deal with low brightness at the worst time: in the bright sun. Outside of this situation, however, the S24 Ultra performs admirably and should please even the pickiest of users, even a year later.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Overall performance is still fantastic even a year later, but the phone's display dims too quickly when the phone gets hot.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One problem that only feels worse with time, however, is the dreadfully slow charging speed. Samsung, Google, and Apple's phones all still charge incredibly slowly, even with a "fast" 45W charger. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> can fully charge in about 30 minutes with the charger included in the box, but Samsung phones still take well over an hour.</p><p>Some people have gotten through this by having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">great wireless charger</a> on their desk or in their car, but it doesn't replace the proper fast charging that most Android brands offer. At the least, battery life is still great a year later and more software-side tweaks in One UI 7 should further help keep battery life great over the seven-year lifespan of the phone.</p>

<p>When I published the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera review</a> last year, I marveled at the improvements Samsung had made. The company had gone from mediocre to the best in most situations, barring just one big area: motion capture.</p><p>While the Galaxy S24 Ultra offered up some options to help reduce blurry moving subjects — usually kids or pets that won't hold still — its performance was still worse than the competition. As of a year later, this hasn't changed a bit. If anything, Samsung looks worse than ever because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">even OnePlus has fixed the same problem</a> that plagued its phones for a long time.</p>

<p>Outside of blurry moving subjects, the Galaxy S24 Ultra still suffers from an incredibly irritating slow shutter speed problem. When you press the shutter button to take a picture on a Galaxy S24 Ultra, there's a truly annoying lag that takes place in the camera viewfinder. I don't see this on <em>any</em> other phone on the market and it's something Samsung needs to address on the S25 Ultra.</p><p>Samsung still does an excellent job of portrait photos, but I've been less impressed with the phone's camera this year than I was last year. Low-light shots aren't as good as the Pixel 9 Pro or OnePlus 13, and even daytime portrait shots aren't as vibrant or beautiful as I expect. While photos from some newer Android phones might be better, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's video recording quality is still top-notch among Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-is-it-still-worth-buying-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Is it still worth buying?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8GmrZTdnEk2YxHXekXRfQg" name="Samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-island-01" alt="The camera array on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8GmrZTdnEk2YxHXekXRfQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the cusp of being officially announced, you're probably wondering if it's still worth buying the Galaxy S24 Ultra. While I can't fully answer that question until the Galaxy S25 Ultra is actually announced, we know for sure that you can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-wait-for-the-s25-when-you-can-score-up-to-usd950-off-the-galaxy-s24-ultra-right-now">Galaxy S24 Ultra deal</a> that will save you hundreds versus waiting a week or so to preorder a Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>The first question is how picky you'll be about any potential display issues you're bound to run into with the S24 Ultra. The display has garnered the largest number of complaints I've seen about the phone over the last year, and while some of them are from power users who nitpick the smallest details, plenty of problems have been noticed by folks who aren't tech-savvy, too. There's no guarantee that Samsung will fix any of these with the S25 Ultra, but it'll likely address at least a few.</p><p>You'll also need to consider the camera, which may be <strong>the </strong>biggest reason to choose something else. If you primarily take pictures of your kids or pets, you should consider a OnePlus 13 or a Pixel 9 Pro. Both take far better pictures of moving subjects, with the Pixel taking a slight edge in this category. If this particular photography category isn't big on your list, the S24 Ultra could be a great pick.</p><p>Lastly, you may want to consider grabbing a OnePlus 13 over either a Galaxy S24 Ultra or a potential Galaxy S25 Ultra for battery life and charging speed. Samsung phones, along with iPhones and Pixels, have long been among the slowest-charging smartphones on the market. That's never been truer in 2025 when phones like the OnePlus 13 take 20 minutes to top-up the battery while an S24 Ultra might take an hour and a half.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-37">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp may be working on a new widget that brings Meta AI to your home screen, letting you chat with the AI or snap photos for instant AI analysis.</li><li>The widget, spotted in WhatsApp beta 2.25.1.27, comes in a 4x1 layout and joins other WhatsApp widgets like the 3x2 and 1x1 options.</li><li>You’ll need access to WhatsApp’s AI chat features to use it, and since Meta AI is still rolling out, it won’t be available to everyone right away.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is reportedly working on a fresh widget that brings Meta AI right to your home screen and snaps photos for instant AI analysis, all in one spot.</p><p>The new widget, spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> beta 2.25.1.27 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-1-27-whats-new/" target="_blank">WABetaInfo</a>, offers two handy features. You can tap the text field to chat directly with Meta AI or use the camera icon to snap a photo and send it for instant AI analysis or other tasks.</p><p>The widget, shown in a 4x1 grid layout, joins WhatsApp’s current 3x2 and 1x1 widgets.</p><p>The new Meta AI widget will be completely optional and will sit alongside WhatsApp’s existing widgets. Designed for convenience, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-starts-testing-meta-ai-on-whatsapp">lets users chat with Meta AI</a> straight from their home screen, skipping the need to open the app.</p><p>Another standout feature of the new widget is its ability to combine quick photo capture with direct Meta AI access. You'll presumably be able to edit images, analyze content, or even ask questions about a photo and get smart, context-aware answers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.13%;"><img id="hHKBMYjaxnd3RTeERgEure" name="Meta-AI-widget" alt="Meta AI widget on the home screen showing access to Meta AI and a camera button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHKBMYjaxnd3RTeERgEure.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="1689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just a heads-up, you’ll need access to WhatsApp’s AI chat features to use this widget. Since Meta AI is still being rolled out in stages and only available in certain territories, it won’t be available to everyone right away.</p><p>Right now, you can access a basic version of Meta AI through WhatsApp’s existing widgets, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-new-meta-ai-widget-beta/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>. However, these don’t offer the full features or smooth functionality expected from the new Meta AI widget in the works.</p><p>A big difference is that the current widgets don’t have a camera shortcut for quick image capture and sharing for AI analysis, something the new widget will include. This shows just how much more seamless the upcoming widget is going to be.</p><p>Meta AI in WhatsApp brings a bunch of tools, all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">powered by Llama 3.1</a>. It goes beyond basic chatbot features, offering a mode akin to Gemini Live meant for more lively and interactive chats. Plus, you can translate languages, summarize info, and even create images right within WhatsApp.</p>

Seeing as OnePlus and OPPO decided against releasing a new foldable phone in 2024, I've been wondering what a potential OnePlus Open successor would bring, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-might-outdo-the-honor-magic-v3-as-the-worlds-slimmest-foldable">now we might have an idea</a>.</p><p>Until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> arrived, the Open was my daily driver, and I still find myself wanting to go back to it. However, after seeing the latest teaser from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1110411735/P9lMhlTL0">post on Weibo</a>, I'm really hoping that OPPO didn't "lose the plot."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-oneplus-open-face-down.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and OnePlus Open face-down with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dS9GZeJta4Bn4kmYb8crCC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I mean is that there seems to be quite a bit of focus on how thin a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> can get. It remains one of the main selling points of the 9 Pro Fold but is something that I don't even care about.</p><p>There were a few things that made the Open great, and the design was definitely one of them. But it's not the main reason why I fell in love with it, and I'm worried that we're in store for some unnecessary sacrifices just for the sake of being thinner than a #2 pencil.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="m89SsR69efxcGZYk8CKg3i" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-oneplus-open-3.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m89SsR69efxcGZYk8CKg3i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I'm disappointed OnePlus skipped a major foldable launch in 2024, I understand why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> hasn't already arrived. There were minimal performance gains with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and outside of some foldable phones outside of the U.S., the Open offered the best cameras in this form factor.</p><p>I've even been impressed with OxygenOS despite it not being as feature-rich as what you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Then again, I don't think <em>any</em> foldable phone matches up with what Samsung phones can do, at least for now. But the Open gets pretty darn close, and I hope that even more functionality comes with the next major release.</p><p>What I don't want is for OPPO and OnePlus to fall into the trap of picking a primary selling point only to make sacrifices elsewhere, particularly where the camera is concerned.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TyHPSrVEVebvBV8YXUTdwC" name="oneplus-open-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyHPSrVEVebvBV8YXUTdwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Open sports a massive module right smack dab in the middle of the back. Sure, this helps the Open <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">stand out</a> from the crowd, but it actually houses a performant trio of sensors, headlined by the 48MP "Pixel Stacked" main camera. This is paired with a 64MP telephoto lens, with 3x optical zoom and 6x "in-sensor" zoom. Then, there's a 48MP ultra-wide lens that also doubles as your macro camera in a pinch and does a pretty good job.</p><p>All of that sounds pretty great, and the Open's camera system still holds up today. Google is partly to blame, as we don't have the same camera system as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> in the 9 Pro Fold because it likely would've made for a thicker phone. To me, it's a dumb reason, but maybe that's why I'm here writing about phones and not making those kinds of "upper-level" decisions.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to say is that I hope that the OnePlus Open 2 is even better than its predecessor in every way possible. If the phone is announced and the camera is the same (or a downgrade), I'm going to be extremely disappointed.</p><p>I've been wanting flagship cameras in foldable phones for years, but the only way that's been possible is to import something from abroad. The Open 2 has the unique opportunity to put both Google and Samsung to shame, and I just hope that it can hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>Monday morning brought in some exciting news from Nothing. A leaked email, allegedly from CEO Carl Pei and shared on X (formerly Twitter)<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank"> by @evleaks, </a>suggested that the company will be joining the big leagues, aka the ring of flagship phones, in 2025 with its Nothing Phone 3.</p><p>Like most flagship phones in the market, the upcoming Nothing phone is set to offer “breakthrough innovations in user interface” and will feature AI.</p><p>In June 2024<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank">, Carl Pei took to Twitter to announce</a> that the Phone 3 will be pushed to 2025 as the company prioritizes improving its AI systems. This is exactly what the recent memo stated as well, Pei added that Nothing will further strengthen its products by focusing on "expanding its camera hardware and software development teams by 50%."</p>

<p>The email stated that “a landmark smartphone launch” is set in Q1. While it's unclear if this is referring to the Nothing Phone 3, we anticipate that Nothing is waiting to reveal a new phone at MWC (Mobile World Congress) 2025 in Barcelona, Spain, as it did with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> last year.</p><p>Recently, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">Nothing smartphone was spotted in a Geekbench database, </a>with model number "A059." The listing states that this device in development could debut with 8GB of RAM and Android 15. It also adds that the phone will debut with a 6.5-inch OLED display and Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC, making it unclear if this is, in fact, the Nothing Phone 3.</p><p>Another speculation is that the Nothing has three phones in active development but does not go into detail as to what those devices might be. It is rumored that the Nothing Phone 3 might debut with other sidekicks along with it, an elite Nothing Phone 3 Pro/Plus and the budget Phone 3a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/nothing-is-ready-to-join-the-big-league-with-first-flagship-phone/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>As for how much the phone could cost, rumors state that the Phone 3 could be around the $600 mark. Talking more about the AI system, Pei stated that the company is "aiming at redefining the user experience with personal computing systems- creating technology that knows you, makes your life easier, and is present where you are."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly packing a new 12nm process version of its LPDDR5X RAM, courtesy of Micron, into the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>A Korean report claims this swap in process is due to the OEM running into "heat generation" issues with the 13nm process.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is also rumored to feature upward of 16GB of RAM, which will be highest it has ever seen if the leaks prove true.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor about the Galaxy S25 suggests Samsung could give it an upgrade that keeps it nice and chill.</p><p>A recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250110000227">EtNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will place its newly developed RAM technology into the Galaxy S25 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/galaxy-s25-samsung-improved-lpddr5x-ram-chips.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the publication, the new tech was developed using a new 12nm process instead of the 13nm process that the Galaxy S24 series rocks.</p><p>With this supposed change, there's one major reported difference: stored heat. The publication's "industry sources" suggest that this new LPDDR5X RAM in the Galaxy S25 will assist with heat generation.</p><p>So, it seems likely that this new form of RAM will generate less heat during continuous/rigorous tasks, thus facilitating an even cooler Galaxy S25 flagship series.</p><p>The change to 12nm was reportedly due to a "heat generation issue" when using the 13nm process. This reason has forced Samsung to swap its RAM chip manufacturer from its in-house kitchen to Micron. Those at Android Headlines add that these slightly upgraded RAM chips may be a little more efficient than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> was given.</p>

<p>Past RAM rumors suggest the Galaxy S25 Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-bump-up-ram-in-its-higher-end-models">could see a bump</a> in its higher-end models. The upcoming could see more RAM than previous generations as speculation claims its 256BGB variant could grab 12GB of RAM. What's more, the device's alleged 1TB variant could see roughly 16GB of RAM.</p><p>That rumor also tossed Samsung's Galaxy AI into the equation, stating the increase in RAM could be to better handle its on-device work. Perhaps, with what we're seeing about a new 12nm RAM process for the series, both could help as the Galaxy S25 will likely have a lot going on internally and software-wise.</p><p>Multiple ongoing tasks will surely create an increase in heat, but taking a small step — such as with its RAM — could aid it in the long run.</p><p>What caught everyone's eye last week was a huge Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">specifications leak</a>.

<ul><li>Samsung posted a short teaser video today (Jan 13), which seemingly alludes to a huge update for its AI, Bixby.</li><li>In the clip, the person involved is giving Bixby a list of tasks to complete, which include an online search and saving that information.</li><li>Samsung's executive vice president, Won-joon Choi, stated the company plans to bolster Bixby due to the rise in gen AI and LLMs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is ramping up the hype surrounding its next Unpacked event as a new teaser drops and teases is AI assistant.</p><p>The Korean OEM posted a short, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/AoX8nleSb64">17-second video teaser</a> on YouTube today (Jan 13) about a "True AI companion" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-shows-off-bixby-upgrades-galaxy-s25-teaser-video/">SamMobile</a>). It seems that Samsung is preparing to upgrade Bixby with a better understanding/comprehension of long, complex commands for (likely) a range of topics.</p><p>In the video, the woman is talking to Bixby on her Galaxy device, which is only highlighted by a rising whimsical wave of blue energy.</p><p>Their command involves telling Bixby to search for an outdoor-seating Italian restaurant that is also "pet-friendly." Additionally, she asks the AI assistant to send it to another person — Luca — and to also "put it in my calendar."</p><p>While Samsung Galaxy users have the company's Galaxy AI to help with tasks, it's not <em>really </em>a "companion." So, as the publication also notes, this feels more like a nod at what's coming next for Bixby. What's more, the post speculates that Samsung may improve the AI helper with better NLP (natural language processing), which could explain the demonstration of this long command with various tasks woven throughout.</p><p>One thing to note is that Samsung has clearly stated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-teases-generative-ai-plans-bixby">it has no plans of giving up on Bixby</a>, per the executive vice president of Samsung’s mobile business, Won-joon Choi. Last spring, Won-joon Choi stated that the company needs to "redefine the role of Bixby" as generative AI and LLMs (large language models) continue to rise.</p><p>More importantly, Won-joon Choi teased that the work Samsung was doing with Bixby would facilitate more "natural conversations." The company's latest teaser seemingly does this. The company's executive vice president also stated that Bixby is a "key voice assistant" across its gadgets and gizmos.</p><p>Before that, Samsung did upgrade Bixby with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-bixby-integration-announced">hands-free update</a> that brought Galaxy AI to the assistant. Utilizing the company's software, Bixby was able to leverage Live Translate, spelling corrections, webpage summaries, and more all by a user's voice command. This initially arrived for the Galaxy S24 before hitting a few past-gen phones.</p><p>There was also an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">overhaul for Bixby</a> that arrived for an overseas market launch of a Galaxy foldable.</p><p>However, with what we've seen teased today, it's clear that there's more in store for Samsung's Bixby <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">on the Galaxy S25</a>. The flagship trio will launch on January 22. It's not far away and we'll finally be able to see if these new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-potential-bixby-relaunch">Bixby upgrades are worth it or not</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly working on a new button in Circle to Search to help users on Android become better gamers.</li><li>The button, currently titled "Get Game Help," will reportedly take a screenshot of your game and run it through the engine.</li><li>Google recently introduced barcode/QR code scanning in Circle to Search alongside help for complex math problems.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly working on taking its device-wide search software to the next level for Android gamers.</p><p>In an APK teardown, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-get-game-help-apk-teardown-3515789/">Android Authority</a> state that Google is potentially developing a new help function for games. The publication reportedly spotted a new suggested option called "Get Game Help." What was discovered was pretty bare bones — though, the actual rollout may not expand much beyond it taking a snapshot of your screen before running a proper search.</p><p>With notable X tipster AssembleDebug assisting, the demo provided showed that Circle to Search will take a snapshot of your screen.</p><p>After placing it in the search field, it will supposedly "add some search text" on its own. This "text" looks to be the following statement: "Get help with this game." Curiously, Circle to Search doesn't specify (in its written query) what game the snapshot concerns.</p><p>From the quick test, Google Search can recognize the game in question; however, the results are extremely broad and don't necessarily <em>help</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:271px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.40%;"><img id="QUWwgxa2kdjgNUYu3r3oNP" name="google-circle-to-search-game-help-button" alt="Circle to Search may soon help users on Android become better gamers with online assistance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUWwgxa2kdjgNUYu3r3oNP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="271" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no telling when this feature will arrive for Android users. The post states it was discovered in version 16.0.7 of the Google app.</p><p>Early on, one thing to note is how general Search's results are for this "get help with this game query." Once it arrives, it might be beneficial for users to re-write the AI's query to something more specific, which was also noted by the publication. Moreover, this feature could be of better to other games like Honkai: Star Rail or Zenless Zone Zero where the content is a little more defined — and the communities (think Reddit and X) for help.</p><p>The demo used Subway Surfer as an example and most of the results provided were basic as they covered Play Store results and TikTok videos.</p><p>Development is likely still progressing, so we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for an official launch later on.</p><p>Last summer, Google expanded its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-get-new-circle-to-search-features">Circle to Search capabilities</a> by providing barcode scanning and help for math homework. When questioned, the company stated students could leverage Circle to Search for "symbolic math" equations and receive "step-by-step" help for how to solve them. Following its initial debut on Samsung's Galaxy foldables, Google dropped it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-circle-to-search-is-now-your-barcode-and-qr-code-scanner">on its Pixels</a> a couple of months later.</p><p>Circle to Search <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">also piggybacks off</a> Google's AI Overviews for users attaching a screenshot and a quick query.</p>

<ul><li>The Samsung Galaxy Ring now comes in sizes 14 and 15 and is available in 53 markets, including 16 new countries.</li><li>Two new sleep tracking features are available including sleep time guidance and a new sleep environment report that syncs with SmartThings.</li><li>The new mindfulness tracker feature lets users track moods, breathing, and stress.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung is working on making the Galaxy Ring more attractive than ever by expanding its health tracking features and ensuring that it fits more customers than ever before.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> now comes in sizes 5-15, two sizes larger than when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">reviewed the Ring</a> last year. Those new sizes 14 and 15 come in all three colorways, including silver, gold, and black, and will debut on January 22, 2025, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">upcoming Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>Samsung also says it's available in 16 new countries including Cyprus, Czech, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="y73qovgF8X4BMijzdzUpp" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-new-2025-sleep-and-health-features" alt="New 2025 Samsung Health features for the Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y73qovgF8X4BMijzdzUpp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1206" height="678" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first new Galaxy Ring software feature is the mindfulness tracker, which will be available in the Samsung Health app soon. The new mindfulness section of the app shows a calendar complete with easy-to-understand, color-coded faces that summarize each day's mood, breathing, and stress levels. This should help organize the data Galaxy Ring already collects more concisely.</p><p>Sometime in the first half of 2025, Samsung will add a new sleep environment report that will use SmartThings-connected devices to add temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity to your morning sleep report. To get these, you'll need to have a thermostat, air quality monitor, or light bulbs connected to your Samsung SmartThings account.</p><p>The second half of 2025 will bring another update to the Galaxy Ring that will suggest optimal bedtime and wake-up time based on collected sleep patterns, habits, and conditions. This new analysis should help users sleep better by being on a regular schedule instead of ending the night after a Netflix binge session.</p><p>While it'll be a while before this feature is available, the bright side is that this feature requires existing data for it to work effectively. If nothing, you'll likely have plenty of sleep data for it to analyze by the time Samsung delivers it.</p>

<hr>
<p>ASUS has officially announced the upcoming Zenfone 12 Ultra, a flagship that’s not following the compact phone trend.</p><p>The company revealed the news on X (formerly Twitter) that the Zenfone<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review"> 12 Ultra will launch on February 6. That’s a bit earlier than last year’s Zenfone</a> 11 Ultra, which came out in March, so it looks like ASUS is pushing up its release schedule.</p>

<p>ASUS' launch announcement comes with a sneak peek at its advanced videography features. A teaser image shows off a feature for 4K video, ensuring the subject stays sharp and clear no matter how the shot moves.</p><p>After ditching the compact design for the larger Zenfone 11 Ultra in 2024, ASUS seems set to stick with this strategy in 2025. There’s no sign of a smaller Zenfone 12 model, with all the buzz and official teasers pointing to the Zenfone 12 Ultra as the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phone</a>.</p><p>Back in August 2024, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/17/exclusive-asus-zenfone-12-ultra-surfaced-but-its-not-coming-right-away/" target="_blank">surfaced</a> that ASUS started working on the Zenfone 12 Ultra after it showed up in the IMEI database. There’s been talk that the Zenfone 12 Ultra might share some features with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9</a> series, suggesting ASUS could be blending some of its top-tier tech across its flagship devices.</p><p>In November, a Bluetooth SIG listing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-bluetooth-sig/" target="_blank">revealed</a> a device with the same model number as the ROG Phone 9 series, sparking rumors that it could be the much-anticipated Zenfone 12 Ultra.</p><p>As for specs, the Zenfone 12 Ultra is expected to pack a punch with the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a huge 5,800mAh battery, and a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display. It’ll supposedly have IP68 dust and water resistance for durability, up to 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.</p><p>ASUS also teased the role of AI in the Zenfone 12 Ultra, declaring on X, "Zenfone 12 Ultra unlocks the power of AI, so get ready to step into a new era of mobile photography excellence!"</p>

<ul><li>T-Mobile and Starlink are deploying their satellite texting service in the Los Angeles area.</li><li>The temporary deployment is hoped to help T-Mobile customers with select Android phones stay connected amid deadly wildfires.</li><li>iPhone users will rely on Apple’s own satellite texting service, rather than T-Mobile and Starlink’s partnership.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Multiple deadly wildfires in the Los Angeles area led <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> and SpaceX to enable satellite texting for people impacted by the natural disaster in California. The feature uses Starlink satellites and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">was set to undergo beta testing by T-Mobile customers</a> early this year. That beta testing period is still on the way, but T-Mobile and SpaceX activated the service for Android users in Los Angeles to help customers stay connected.</p><p>“T-Mobile and Starlink opened up T-Mobile Starlink Direct-to-Cellular service over impacted areas of Southern California to deliver wireless emergency alerts and SMS and enable 911 texting,” T-Mobile told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-and-spacex-turn-on-satellite-texting-for-los-angeles-fires/" target="_blank">CNET</a> on Thursday, Jan. 9 as firefighters struggled to contain the wildfires.</p><p>“While SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, we are once again temporarily making this early test version available for those who need it most,” the wireless carrier continued.</p><p>Satellite connectivity enables T-Mobile customers with select Android phones to contact loved ones and emergency services when cellular networks are unavailable. T-Mobile told CNET that commercial power loss in the region caused cell networks in and around Los Angeles to go offline, but added that it had "restored roughly half of the sites that were impacted by commercial power loss."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">Starlink</a> also announced the move in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “For those in the Los Angeles area, the Starlink team and T-Mobile have enabled basic texting (SMS) through our Direct to Cell satellites,” the post explains. “You can now text loved ones, text 911, and receive emergency alerts.”</p>

<p>T-Mobile and Starlink have activated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/starlink-direct-to-cell-open-to-any-telecom-says-spacex-exec">its satellite-based network</a> during other natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Miltion and Helene. iPhone users will get Apple’s version of satellite messaging, powered by Globalstar, instead of using T-Mobile and Starlink’s solution.</p><p>T-Mobile customers in the Los Angeles area can text as they normally would, through their phone’s default SMS app. When cellular service is unavailable, select T-Mobile Android phones will fall back on satellites for connectivity. This emergency deployment could help people stay connected with each other and first responders amid a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>New Year's resolutions have taken on a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. Cold weather and returning to work sap your motivation. Then you hear excuses about Quitters Day — how "most people" abandon their resolutions by the second Friday in January — and settle back into your old routines because your resolutions were always doomed to fail. Convenient!</p><p>Apple referenced Quitters Day in its latest commercial, promising that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> will give you "a little extra motivation" to "quit quitting." It's a nice idea, but as someone who's tested most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a>, none of them can fundamentally change how you act by buzzing your wrist.</p><p>Watch alerts like hourly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">move reminders</a> or having to log meals in your health app quickly become a source of guilt and annoyance because you feel like you don't have the bandwidth or energy for them. It's far too easy to turn these features off or stop using them until the guilt of abandoning your 2025 goals ebbs away.</p><p>Smartwatches are only built to reinforce habits and hobbies that you already enjoy, not magically make you love exercise or counting calories.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I believe in using tech and New Year's resolutions to motivate myself. They work for me! I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">lost 30 pounds last year</a>, ran more miles, hiked more steps than in 2023, and finished more personal projects — all with a Google Doc of resolutions and a smartwatch to motivate me. Believe it or not, I had <em>fun</em> following my resolutions.</p><p>Keeping in mind that I don't know what <em>your</em> New Year's resolutions for 2025 might be, let me help you "quit quitting" by running through a resolutions template that I think anyone can easily follow and that you can start any time or month, not just January.</p>
<h2 id="set-monthly-goals-with-moving-goalposts-2">Set monthly goals with moving goalposts</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:806px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="wTkUuuKod2TrqjYwKNCyuQ" name="Resolutions-example-steps" alt="A screenshot of a Google Doc file showing goals for hitting certain step counts per month, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace goals for each of the 12 months." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTkUuuKod2TrqjYwKNCyuQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="806" height="453" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My Google Doc for my 2025 New Year's resolutions, with dropdown menus for different goal tiers; you can easily organize your own Doc in the same way. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm no psychologist, but I think it's pretty obvious that people with the weight and pressure of a <em>year</em>'s expectations will quit when they can't keep up with ambitious goals. If you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">walk 10,000 steps a day</a> to lose weight and then fail to do so a few days in a row, you won't bother restarting because you've already failed!</p><p>Now look at my personal walking and steps resolutions for 2025, above and below. Each month has a main gold-medal target — I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">love the Olympics</a> — with bronze and silver offramps for months where I fall short and a level above gold in case I'm feeling especially motivated that month.</p><p>Why organize my goals this way? Simple: Whether your goal is related to steps, calories, or whatever, you're going to have sick days, tough weeks at work, or even whole months where life's roadbumps derail or distract you. So, you need to plan for failure if you want to succeed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UHkJadh2w93hfb5ho4FR5c" name="Resolutions-example" alt="A Google doc file showing my goals for finishing a certain number of hikes and miles walked per year, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace benchmarks for any given month." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UHkJadh2w93hfb5ho4FR5c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1534" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My Google Doc for my 2025 New Year's resolutions, with bronze, silver, gold, and ace tiers for each month. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even if I'm off my target pace for a given month, I can still hit my lesser targets, so I have a reason to persist. If I have a bad month, I still have 11 other months to shoot for gold; why quit?</p><p>If you're trying to read more books or cook new recipes, it's less daunting to aim for two a month than 20 that year. Maybe you skip a few months or only hit your backup silver goal with one book/recipe that month. But it doesn't matter: you're still outpacing last year when you gave up entirely.</p><p>The same goes for vaguer goals like making an effort to see friends more often or trying to drink or vape less often. Use an artificial monthly goal (only drink X times in January, plan a board game night for February) until it feels more natural without handrails, and don't give up entirely just because you chickened out the first month.</p><p>Eventually, these monthly goals will build a foundation of habits, so you do these things without needing to track them.</p>
<h2 id="treat-your-resolutions-like-a-living-document-2">Treat your resolutions like a living document</h2>
<p>One reason to make your resolutions monthly instead of annual is that you can change your targets if you realize you made them too easy or difficult but still want to keep at it. Plus, you can add <em>new</em> goals at any time.</p><p>It's hard to think about a goal like "swim more at the local pool" or "go hiking more" when it's snowing and the trails are too muddy to climb. Some ideas don't apply — or won't come to you — until months from now.</p><p>My advice is to make more short-term resolutions, like an aspirational to-do list. If you want to try homebrewing beer or joining a local sports league, add it to your resolutions doc with a generous timeframe for when to start or sign up so it doesn't fade out of your mind like other past fancies.</p><p>Adding new resolutions that you can quickly achieve throughout the year — and then moving on to something new — is the best way to keep things fresh. Otherwise, you'll get bored tracking the same stats and goals month after month.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-resolutions-fun-2">Make your resolutions fun</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8" name="San-Francisco-Bridge-Half-Marathon-Golden-Gate.jpeg" alt="Me standing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge during the San Francisco Bridge Half Marathon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vDevfVsBWvJZUefw5yyrq8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me, running the San Francisco Half Marathon </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People don't like to think about difficult things, and most resolutions <em>are</em> difficult because they require changing how you lived your life in the past months or years.</p><p>I'm the kind of weirdo who loves running, so aiming to run more miles or beat my fastest half-marathon PR in 2025 is aspirational rather than painful to consider. You should associate your goals with positivity, not a chore or burden, or it's much harder to stick with it.</p><p>If you're invested in difficult resolutions like budgeting or cutting calories, make your overall New Year's resolutions more positive by throwing some fun gimmies onto your list, with no monthly timeline or difficulty curve.</p><p>Some of my resolutions are "beat 20 new video games in 2025" and "finish 12 new seasons of TV shows." It's no effort for me to finish these "resolutions," and I probably would have done so anyway! But that's the point.</p><p>My resolutions Google Doc is full of movies, shows, games, and books that I've been looking forward to. Checking them off my list lets me feel like taking care of my mental health is an accomplishment, and it feels more satisfying than sitting around watching YouTube or TikTok.</p><p>Plus, while I'm deciding which fun thing to do that night, I also scroll through my <em>harder</em> fitness or home improvement goals. Bribing myself with a fun resolution first makes it easier to plan out a difficult workout or project the following day.</p>

<p>I wrote late last year about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-your-new-cyber-monday-smartwatch-to-shed-thanksgiving-pounds">using fitness tech to shed Thanksgiving pounds</a>, and while that holiday is long past, my advice still applies. Hourly stand reminders, walking more steps, using calorie apps like MyFitnessPal, and other tech tools are accessible ways to get healthier.</p><p>In my case, I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> to guide my runs and then check my monthly stats like mileage, steps, and race times in the app to transfer over to my resolutions doc. It doesn't have to be Garmin; if your smartwatch of choice doesn't organize stats monthly, export to Strava or another fitness app that does because it's too easy to lose track if you log every activity manually.</p><p>Some fitness apps (like Garmin and Strava) have monthly challenges, but I think those are cherry-on-top rewards for working hard, not real motivators. If you start slacking off and stop closing your daily rings or see your VO2 Max fall, it's too easy to refuse to open the app because you know you won't like seeing your results.</p><p>A Google Doc or another note app can always remain open more easily, and you can highlight the stats <em>you</em> care about instead of getting overwhelmed with irrelevant data.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube Music just gave the 'Top Songs' section on artist pages a welcome update. The redesign aims to make it easier for fans to dive into an artist's biggest hits.</p><p>Before the update, artist pages showcased a list of five curated Top Songs upfront. You could tap 'More' to see the full list or start playback right away, with tracks flowing smoothly through the 'Up Next' queue.</p><p>The latest change, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/10/youtube-music-top-songs-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, revamps the Top Songs section on artist pages with a scrollable carousel. Each page shows four tracks, and you can swipe through five pages to check out all 20 songs.</p><p>This new layout makes it super easy to check out the top hits of a newly discovered artist since it eliminates the need to tap in order to expand the Top Songs section. All you need to do is swipe through and explore their music effortlessly.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> keeps it simple with a handy 'Play All' button in the revamped interface, letting you instantly play all the songs in the carousel.</p>

<p>The carousel's design closely mirrors the 'Quick Picks' layout from the Home tab. This cohesive style also carries over to other sections like 'Long listens' and 'Trending.'</p><p>According to 9to5Google, the revamped Top Songs section is widely available on Android and iOS, but some users haven’t seen the new carousel or Play All button yet. Looks like YouTube Music is rolling it out in phases.</p><p>YouTube Music has been on a roll with updates lately. The latest tweak follows the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-monthly-audience-stat-test-detailed">introduction of a new "monthly audience" metric</a> on artist pages, giving fans a glimpse into an artist's reach and listener engagement. Late last year, the platform also added a much-requested feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-gains-a-crucial-feature-for-podcast-listening-and-sharing">shareable links</a>. Now, users can share specific timestamps in songs, podcasts, or other audio, making it easier to recommend the exact moment that hits just right, like the main YouTube app.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Oppo Find N5 is tipped to launch soon, rumored to feature a super slim design with a titanium frame.</li><li>Leaks suggest the Find N5 (and consequently the OnePlus Open 2) could be the thinnest foldable yet, possibly beating the Honor Magic V3, which currently holds that title.</li><li>Key features include a Hasselblad triple-camera system with periscope lens, Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, satellite communication, and a "nearly 6,000mAh" battery with wireless charging.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Fresh reports from China hint at the Oppo Find N5's upcoming launch, and it's tipped to flaunt a super slim design wrapped in a titanium frame.</p><p>Originally rumored for a 2024 release, the Find N5 (from which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> is taking inspiration) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-2-might-launch-much-later-than-we-hoped">faced some unexpected delays</a>. There were even rumors it might get scrapped altogether. But recent leaks have put those worries to rest, showing that OnePlus and Oppo are still committed to making this book-style foldable a reality.</p><p>In a Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5121184775012675" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Digital Chat Station shared that the upcoming Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium chassis. They also claim that it will be the thinnest foldable phone yet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-Open-2-World-s-next-thinnest-foldable-smartphone-tipped-to-be-made-with-titanium.945100.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>).</p><p>If these claims hold true, the upcoming Oppo model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-thinner-design-rumors">could dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest book-style foldable</a>. The Magic V3 currently measures 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded. This would set a new benchmark in the foldable market, though the leaker hasn't shared specific dimensions of the upcoming device.</p><p>While previous leaks have teased the OnePlus Open 2's look, they haven't confirmed the materials used. However, the idea of a titanium body seems plausible, given how popular this lightweight yet durable metal has become in premium phones.</p><p>Titanium’s strength and lightness make it a top pick for flagships like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the upcoming S25 Ultra. So, if the OnePlus Open 2 uses titanium, it would fit right in with the latest design trends and further cement its status as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">premium foldable</a>.</p><p>In a separate Weibo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/P8MOkkQkw" target="_blank">post</a>, leaker Smart Pikachu shared a detailed look at the device’s key features. The design focuses on durability, with a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, including a periscope lens for better optics.</p><p>The tipster also claims that the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and support satellite communication. It could also pack a "nearly 6,000mAh" battery with wireless charging support.</p><p>Smart Pikachu also hinted at a February 2025 launch for the Oppo Find N5. This timing gives OnePlus a solid chance to lead the foldable market. With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 not expected until later in the year, the Open 2 could have a strong, uncontested run, helping it grab market share and build a loyal following before its biggest competitor arrives.</p>

Unlike their larger foldable counterparts that open to reveal a larger tablet-like display, these phones go for a more compact approach by shrinking down to half their size, often with a cover screen for basic controls over notifications and more.</p><p>There isn't much in the way of added functionality as you get with larger foldables, but flip phones go for the "less is more" approach, which I have become quite enamored with in recent years. In the absence of compact "mini" phones, flip phones offer a nice medium, in a sense offering the best of both worlds.</p><p>However, while the experience of using one is fun, flip phones are far from perfect, and in some ways, they are a half step down from a conventional smartphone. Companies like Samsung and Motorola have worked for years to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> up to speed with traditional smartphone models, and I think they're almost there.</p><p>So, what do I think a perfect flip phone look like, and could we achieve this?</p>

<h2 id="size-matters-2">Size matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones are often seen as a more compact version of a conventional smartphone, which is true in some aspects. After all, you're basically folding down a phone to half its size. However, that introduces a new problem: the phone becomes twice as thick when folded.</p><p>This isn't that big of a problem with larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> (unless you're Samsung) because there's enough area to spread out the batteries and other components so that folding the phone gives you roughly the same thickness as a traditional smartphone, with the device getting <em>thinner</em> when unfolded.</p><p>With flip phones, the opposite occurs, and the phone gets thicker because you have to somehow squeeze two batteries, two displays, a folding hinge mechanism, and all the other components into the same size as a regular phone. The result is a phone that's often thicker than a folded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (which is saying something).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4221px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hinge.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQTJ9P6J9rk777bFSQAcR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4221" height="2374" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The downside of this is that in my pocket, the phone doesn't take up as much surface area, which is nice, but it does protrude a lot more, which can look a little funny. More importantly, this thickness has prevented me from consistently using cases on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review" target="_blank">Razr Plus 2024</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> because they just add even more thickness to the phones. And while I love how the Razr feels without a case, I'd feel much better having one on than not, but not if it makes the phone unnecessarily bulky.</p><p>My hope is that, somehow, some way, companies are able to minimize the thickness of the phones, perhaps by using thinner and denser batteries or tweaking the hinge designs even further. Of course, this has to be done without trade-offs like reduced battery life or compromising the integrity of the device.</p><p>I don't expect this to be figured out in 2025, but I hope to see companies working toward this goal</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-16.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xk33zq3Ca5579tvjuvpsre.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've never been a fan of the tall 22:9 aspect ratio that flip phones have adopted. It's one thing when Sony started going with 21:9 aspect ratios on Xperia phones to achieve a more "cinematic" look, but there doesn't seem to be an aesthetic reason behind the tall screens on flip phones.</p><p>I find tall phones to be a bit of a nuisance for the simple reason that I tend to use my phone one-handed, and I know I'm not alone in this. It's one thing to have a display closing in on seven inches, but it's another thing to make it so that I have to completely shift the way I'm holding my phone in order to reach UI elements toward the top of the display.</p><p>Of course, we could start asking OEMs and developers to start changing their UI to better accommodate this, but that's an article for another time.</p><p>One flip phone that I think nailed this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-razr-2022-launch">Motorola Razr 2022</a>, which features a more natural-feeling 20:9 aspect ratio. It's a bummer that the phone never made it to the States and that Motorola switched to the taller aspect ratio in subsequent models, but I hope companies can move away from this</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XwmSSrLrKvQfobwQaJ9hSN" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cameras.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XwmSSrLrKvQfobwQaJ9hSN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones aren't known for having the best cameras, especially when compared to more traditional flagship smartphones, and it's really a shame. After all, I'm spending the same amount of money or more for a foldable, so I should have camera quality that matches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android camera phones</a>.</p><p>That's not to say it's all bad; in fact, flip phone cameras are getting better, as we've seen with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024. It's not just a flip phone thing; companies like Google and Samsung tend to skimp out on camera sensors when it comes to foldable phones. It could be a size constraint thing or a cost issue, but either way, something's gotta change if we're gonna continue to shell out $1,000+ for a phone just to get lower-quality cameras.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3932px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8" name="OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-review-12.jpg" alt="OPPO Find N3 Flip tented from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sxSwtaPe4AoDHdJBCD9iT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3932" height="2212" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only that but flip phones are often constrained by the number of cameras they offer. Most tend to sport two rear cameras, and while a select few from companies like OPPO and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-pocket-2-launch">Huawei</a> have offered a third sensor, it's certainly not the norm. I would love to see more flip phones with a telephoto camera in addition to a wide and ultrawide.</p><p>Samsung has sort of worked out a happy medium with the Z Flip 6 by improving the digital zoom quality using AI. It's a decent effort to get past the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera, but a software solution can only go so far.</p><p>If you want a good camera system, you would actually save money by purchasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which has a third sensor and pretty great cameras. Even the cheapest "entry-level" flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> comes with a triple-camera system — with a 3x telephoto camera — and costs hundreds less, highlighting the discrepancy between traditional smartphones and flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-other-camera-problem-2">The other camera problem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-10.jpg" alt="Google Messages on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66FMYDhBrM6ELGfymJGhCn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I would like to see more cameras on flip phones, that introduces a new problem that OEMs have to figure out: where are these cameras going?</p><p>Because of the ever-expanding cover screens on flip phones, OEMs have to get creative when it comes to the placement of the camera modules. The cameras have to hold space on the same square cover panel as the external display, and they can't obstruct the cover screen experience too much. OEMs have tried different methods with varying levels of success, but they all seem to have downsides.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 has one of the largest external screens you'll find on a flip phone, but because it takes up the <em>entire</em> cover panel, the company opted for cutouts for the cameras and flash. It works mostly fine, but because the cameras tend to cover certain app elements, Motorola lets you shift the app upwards in a condensed view to access that part of the app. Again, it works fine when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">using apps on the Razr cover screen</a>, but it's an extra step when doing something like sending a message and trying to tap the <strong>Send</strong> button, often located on the bottom right side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-15.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 cover screen with YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpvT2fjNbbhfNrHPegS9E8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung went with an awkward cutout on the cover screen to avoid the cameras completely. The problem with this method is that the overall <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">app experience on the cover screen</a> feels uncomfortably scrunched up. Meanwhile, other companies like OPPO and TECNO moved their external displays or software experiences to one side of the cover panel to avoid the cameras, providing a fully vertical app view. While it seemingly makes more sense, just about every app element is minimized, which actually feels less convenient in actual use.</p><p>So, how can we have both a large cover screen and a multi-camera system on a flip phone without one obstructing the other? The only way I can imagine this might work is to adopt under-display cameras so they won't get in the way, providing an unrestricted cover screen experience. Unfortunately, that could result in degraded camera quality, which takes me back to my previous problem with flip phones.</p>
<h2 id="catching-up-where-it-matters-2">Catching up where it matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zQ76E72LUqCkBT9UtXVf3G" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-24.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 next to its 70W charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zQ76E72LUqCkBT9UtXVf3G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I've stated, flip phones have come a long way from where they started, and I've been happy to see companies like Samsung and Motorola improve year after year.</p><p>In addition to improved camera quality, flip phones have become much more durable and are not able to withstand drops better. They can also be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">fully submerged in water</a>, and we've even started seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-waterproof">official dust resistance</a> ratings appear on phones, which should give consumers more peace of mind.</p><p>Battery life is one area that still lags, but that's slowly improving as well. In fact, companies have managed to catch up with and even exceed some traditional flagship smartphones. Samsung and Motorola fit 4,000mAh batteries into last year's models, bringing roughly all-day battery life to their phones. TECNO and Xiaomi took it to the next level with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Flip</a>, offering massive 4,720mah and 4,780mAh batteries, respectively.</p><p>Those two phones also feature 70W and 67W charging, much faster than the speeds on Samsung's top-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip phones are also reaching lower prices, making it a great time to buy one if you've been on the fence. With phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a>, you can snag a foldable for as low as $500. That's about the same as you'd pay for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> that don't flip, except now you get a much more interesting smartphone.</p><p>These are just some of the ways we've seen flip phones evolve over the years since their resurgence. With these changes and improvements, flip phones are becoming much more mainstream than their larger-screened foldable counterparts, and I can't wait to see how the form factor improve in 2025 and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="my-perfect-flip-phone-2">My perfect flip phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-4.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPWe8Qrh2AMDzZjTbs6aY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that I've outlined my current issues with flip phones and the ways the form factor has improved, it's got me thinking about what my perfect flip phone would look like in an ideal world where I could have my way when designing and building my own phone without restrictions.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect (although some of them come close), and my thoughts are likely to change throughout the year and in years to follow. For now, this is what I would like to see in a flip phone:</p><p>The device would feature a design similar to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, complete with curved edges and an expansive cover screen. It would have a 6.7-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and measure no more than 11mm when folded (roughly half that when unfolded).</p><p>The battery would have a capacity of no less than 4,000mAh, and the phone would charge at 67W with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">Qi2</a> (with built-in magnets).</p><p>There would be three 50MP rear cameras hidden under the cover screen, including wide, ultrawide, and telephoto sensors, with camera quality matching something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The front-facing camera would also be an under-display unit.</p><p>The UI? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, but with the ability to natively run apps out of the box without needing to rely on Good Lock.</p><p>Basically, I want a phone built by Motorola with Samsung's software and Google's (or OnePlus's) cameras. Much of this sounds a bit farfetched, although who knows what flip phones will look like in a few years, especially when Google and Apple decide to launch their own models. Until then, I'll be looking forward to whatever Motorola or Samsung bring us in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google dropped Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to fine-tune connectivity, customization, performance, and stability in the beta channel.</li><li>The update includes January 2025 security patches and fixes issues like app crashes, freezes, and random reboots.</li><li>It also fixes a weird bug where Emoji Workshop settings pop up when changing wallpapers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hxn904/android_15_qpr2_beta_21_now_available/" target="_blank">pushed out</a> Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.1 to Pixels mainly to fix some pesky bugs.</p><p>The latest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-2-is-here-with-our-first-look-at-the-working-linux-terminal-app">builds on Android 15 and QPR2</a>, bringing tweaks to improve connectivity, customization, performance, and overall stability in the beta channel. For developers, it’s their chance to test apps against the new features and system changes, making sure everything runs smoothly for users.</p><p>This release is pretty light on changes compared to the big QPR2 Beta 2 list, but that’s what you’d expect from a point release like this.</p><p>This update, with the build number BP11.241121.013, packs in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/january-2025-security-patch-rolling-out-for-google-pixel-devices-heres-whats-fixed">January 2025 security patches</a> along with Pixel-specific tweaks. The main focus is to fix those annoying issues like apps crashing, system freezes, and random reboots that some beta users have been dealing with.</p><p>Here's what's fixed:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed several issues that sometimes caused a device to freeze, crash, or restart unexpectedly. (Issue #380500068, Issue #381894854, Issue #378856187, Issue #384447026, Issue #384885640, Issue #385056337, Issue #385126181)</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Emoji Workshop options opened when selecting wallpapers from other categories in system settings. (Issue #384629413)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability and connectivity.</li></ul>
<p>On top of that, this update fixes a weird bug where the Emoji Workshop settings would randomly pop up when choosing a new wallpaper.</p><p>This update also brings some solid improvements to system stability and network reliability.</p><p>Like previous Android 15 updates, this one works with the Pixel 6, 7, 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">9 series</a>, as well as the Pixel Fold, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and Pixel Tablet. If you’ve got one of these devices and want to try out the beta, just head to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">registration page</a>. There, you can pick the device you want to use for testing out the beta updates.</p>

The two words to pay close attention to in that sentence are <em>possibly</em> and <em>Korea</em>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> Subscription Club is already a thing in Samsung's home country for its line of smart appliances. The service launched in December to a very positive consumer reaction, and subscription sales already accompany 30% of purchases at Samsung stores. People in South Korea love Samsung and its software and are willing to buy it.</p><p>People in the U.S. aren't as enthusiastic.</p>

<p>That's why you might have seen news about Samsung's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-phone-subscription-club-service-detailed">phone subscription</a>" in the news this week. Thanks to some rather questionable articles on the matter, people assumed that Samsung was introducing some sort of subscription pricing to use the phones we're about to see at Galaxy Unpacked.</p><p>To be very clear — we're not. This is <strong>only</strong> for special AI services, even if it makes its way to the U.S. I hate that we call this a phone subscription because it's not; it's a software subscription that is no different than what Adobe or Norton offer for your PC. Phone stuff is weird sometimes.</p>
<p>Enough about what the AI Club is and that it might expand. Let's talk about the reaction. Why do people hate it when Samsung does the exact same thing that Apple and Google already are doing, for the same type of service?</p><p>If you use a new iPhone, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">Apple Intelligence</a> features free until 2027, but to get the most from it you can connect it to a paid ChatGPT subscription that costs $20 a month.</p><p>If you use an Android phone in select countries, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> for free. To get the most from Gemini, you can subscribe to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plan that includes Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 a month.</p><p>Samsung has already said that all Galaxy AI features are free for phone and tablet users until at least the end of 2025. It <em>might</em> include an AI subscription tier in South Korea.</p><p>If it's OK for Apple and Google, it should be OK for Samsung.</p>

<p>Judging by the internet tech prosumer reaction, it's clearly not OK for Samsung to do it. That's because of the way we view Samsung in the West.</p><p>When you think of Samsung, you probably think of phones and the parts used to make phones. Samsung is well known as an electronics manufacturer and almost every phone has some Samsung parts inside of it. Even an iPhone.</p><p>Samsung is really good at this, too. There is no consumer outrage about the performance of a Samsung display on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>. Samsung's memory and controllers are great and part of what makes your flagship phone so fast. The company's phones and tablets are no slouch either, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best you can buy</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to software, there isn't the same enthusiasm. The company seems to have finally built a great version of Android with recent versions of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI</a>, but most tech enthusiasts don't use Samsung's phone software very much or at all.</p><p>Samsung's apps are like the Stocks app on an iPhone and end up crammed in a junk folder if they can't be disabled. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a> (which isn't really that bad) is a laughing stock among Android enthusiasts, and what Samsung did to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-tizen-powered-z1-rival-android-one-if-not-all-android">Tizen</a> should send some people straight to Dante's Inferno.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE" name="tizen-z1-1.jpg" alt="Tizen on a Samsung phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCKKSdoGMEBfAG7KTfHgtE.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>This is what U.S. tech enthusiasts think of Samsung's software. You don't have to look very hard to find people saying they wish they could buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> that runs Google's Pixel version of Android, and there are plenty of people trying to hack just that onto their expensive phones. Most consumers don't know any better or even care and just use what's there, but die-hard techies are the people who get vocal on the internet about everything.</p>
<p>I would never pay for an AI subscription, at least until it offers more than a different way to feed me information that's already available. When that happens, I don't care if Samsung, Apple, or Google offers it — I'll buy whatever suits my needs best.</p><p>More than likely, we won't have to worry about this at all here in North America and this was just a handy excuse to complain about Samsung and AI in general.</p>

First, the specs of the devices leaked online, followed by the full renders with over 75 odd pictures of what we think is the actual Samsung S25 series.</p><p>The morning of Jan. 10 started off with pictures of official renders of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 series that were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>. First up we see the S25 Ultra pictures that show rounded corners and an entirely flat display and sides for the phone. The back of the device is shown with its rumored four-camera array and lenses that could have black rims. The publication states the Galaxy S25 Ultra could see the following colors upon release: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus pictures reveal that they look a lot like their previous models, and each device features rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thin bezels. However, the only visible change is with the lenses, as those could grab the same black rings as the Ultra model. They are said to come in four colorways: Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint.</p>

<p>Along with the renders, the entire spec sheet of the models was also leaked by the same publication. The trio's entire spec sheet shows that the Ultra is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto.</p><p>The S25 and S25 Plus could see a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch display, respectively. They will have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Both handsets will also have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p>

The OnePlus 13 has a 6.8-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate, the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, and a larger 6,000 mAh battery. For the camera systems, OnePlus partnered once again with Hasselblad for a powerful triple camera system: a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP 3X Triprism Telephoto camera, which is equipped to capture shots at more than 10X zoom.</p><p>Android Central's Nick Sutrich said in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review" target="_blank">camera review</a> that the OnePlus 13 can stand tall knowing that "it's got one of the finest mobile cameras available today."</p><p>OnePlus 13R gets the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, with a 6.78-inch 1.5K ProXDR flat display, 6,000 mAh battery, and an upgraded camera system.

Its main 50MP camera, equipped with the Sony LYT-700 sensor and OIS, helps shoot better images in low-light conditions. The camera can also capture swift moments like the OnePlus 13, with a 50MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom for sharp, detailed portraits and an 8MP ultra-wide camera for capturing "expansive scenes."</p><p>The OnePlus 13 comes in three colors, Midnight Ocean, Arctic Dawn, and Black Eclipse, costing $899.99, while the 13R comes in two colorways — Nebula Noir and Astral Trail, which costs $599.99.</p><p>Both devices are currently available for pre-order.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>In some ways, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's display is the best Samsung has ever made. It finally upgraded the PWM dimming rate to match the iPhone, and Samsung's new anti-glare filter made it easier to see in the sunlight.</p><p>But problems were brewing under the surface and have slowly cropped up over the last year, leading us to wonder if Samsung will fix them in the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series.</p><p>From grainy displays to dull colors, Samsung has some work to do on the quality and configuration of the display itself. We've also seen Galaxy S24 Ultra models with permanent smudge marks on the screen, a sign that the oil-resistant layer is wearing off prematurely.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung continues to be one of the only remaining companies that don't offer eye-friendly dimming options for folks sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> and flickering LEDs. Here's everything Samsung needs to improve on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display to retake the crown for the phone with the best display.</p>
<h2 id="grainy-displays-2">Grainy displays</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1796px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-mura.jpg" alt="An extreme close up of the Galaxy S24 Ultra's panel at a brightness under 10%." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HaN6EnSjhANoWUyrqSgZPc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1796" height="1010" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Early on, users complained of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-grainy-mura-problem-reported">grainy displays</a>. While this is mostly noticeable at low brightness levels, some users have noted that they can see the grain even at regular or high brightness. This problem, technically known as "mura," is one we haven't seen so widely since the days of the Google Pixel 2 XL and it persists on Galaxy S24 Ultra displays today. You can see the uneven pattern in the image above which I captured using a microscope on my Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>The grainy issue is caused by manufacturing defects where adjacent pixels aren't as bright as each other, making it look spotty or grainy. Pixels on an OLED are all individually lit and part of the manufacturing and calibration process is ensuring that each pixel meets a specific uniformity level.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung is skipping this step or if the M13 generation is just particularly prone to this graininess issue. What is clear, however, is that no other phone with an OLED screen suffers from this issue in such a major way. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2024/11/18/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-fixes-grainy-display-without-m14-oled/">November rumor</a> says that Samsung fixed the problem in the Galaxy S25 Ultra by using M13+ panels, but we'll have to wait and see if that's the case.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-smudges-2">Permanent smudges</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-smudgy-screen" alt="Smudges on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYyF49Mn6WpPDz9jXKmFEG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone has had to wipe down their smartphone display from time to time to remove smudges and dirt, but some unfortunate Galaxy S24 Ultra users have found that the smudges on their screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-display-coating-premature-wear-out-3509276/">never go away</a>.</p><p>This is believed to be caused by a premature degradation of the oleophobic coating on the outside of the display. This coating is applied to glass to keep fingerprints and smudges at a minimum, as it's naturally resistant to water, oils, and other liquids.</p><p>The result is a display that looks permanently dirty, and only a replacement of the glass will fix the issue. Worse yet, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s24-ultra-display-smudge-poll-results-3511629/">Android Authority poll</a> shows that potentially 50% or more of Galaxy S24 Ultra users are experiencing this problem. Our advice for Galaxy S24 Ultra owners without this problem is to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-screen-protectors">good Galaxy S24 Ultra screen protector</a> on your phone immediately.</p><p>Samsung <em>needs</em> to fix this problem on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's non-negotiable for a $1,200+ smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="better-dimming-options-2">Better dimming options</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9cRdEYEm2C7PAfierAyAU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As more and more research piles up, it's clear that using PWM dimming on displays and LED bulbs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">is causing health problems</a>. Since I began writing about this problem nearly two years ago, I've been able to help lots of people get rid of the headaches they'd been experiencing daily by recommending smartphones and light bulbs that don't flicker.</p><p>Unfortunately, Samsung is one of the worst offenders of flickering displays. Those displays are only getting harsher and more painful every year since companies are obsessed with making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">brighter and brighter</a>. The solution is extraordinarily simple, but Samsung so far has refused to talk about it or make any sort of accessibility changes for the betterment of its users' long-term health.</p><p>U.S. users, in particular, have almost no flicker-free options to choose from since Samsung, Google, and Apple all now equip every phone they make with flickering displays. Samsung has a real opportunity to get things right with the Galaxy S25 series and take the lead on eye health as the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.</p><p>If companies like OnePlus, Nothing, Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and many other brands can do it, Samsung can too.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-forget-the-fans-2">Don't forget the fans</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-good-lock-module.jpg" alt="S24 Ultra showcasing Good Lock modules" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4gpMuHf4NvR79YBDgV2mkc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last problem is the least egregious but one that probably irritated fans the most. At launch, the Galaxy S24 Ultra's display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">was duller than previous Galaxy flagships</a>.</p><p>I praised the more realistic colors of the display in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra review</a>, and while Samsung did an excellent job of tweaking the colors to make them more realistic, the company seemingly forgot that some of its users love vibrant, highly saturated colors.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/first-major-galaxy-s24-patch">released a patch</a> about a month after the S24 Ultra's release addressing the issue and providing a vibrancy slider for folks that wanted bolder colors. Hopefully, the company won't forget this option when it launches the Galaxy S25 Ultra sometime soon.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The United States has added technology giant China-based Tencent to a list of companies designated as partners with the Chinese military, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Tencent is one of the ten biggest companies in the world, with ownership or investment in multiple game developers and publishers, and is the developer of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-wechat-and-why-trump-banning-it">WeChat</a>, one of the world's largest social media and messaging platforms.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">WeChat was specifically named to be banned</a> along with TikTok by the first Trump administration, but this was halted by a federal judge and officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/biden-undos-trumps-wechat-and-tiktok-bans">undone by the Biden administration. </a></p><p>Now, it appears the whole mess is happening again, albeit for a different reason this time.</p>
<p>In the past, concerns over WeChat centered around data collection and retention by China. This time, Tencent — WeChat's parent company — is under scrutiny because the U.S. thinks it has ties to the Chinese military. In statements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a> and Bloomberg, Tencent has denied these allegations and says it will work with the Department of Defense to be removed from this list.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG" name="tencent.jpg" alt="Tencent hallway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XLxKLTsUMCHMojknJA2bxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Zhu Min / Zuma Press)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the meantime, being on the list doesn't block anyone from using Tencent's services or gaming titles. You can still play Valorant or League of Legends, and WeChat use in the States won't be interrupted in any way. It does, however, deal quite a blow to a company's reputation in the West, and Tencent's stock prices fell over seven percentage points with the news.</p>
<p>So what <em>does</em> this mean? WeChat is the brand most affected by anything that happens with Tencent because it is the company's biggest platform by far. With approximately 1 billion users in China alone, the platform dwarfs most other services of its type. It's worth noting that there are also over 4 million WeChat users in the U.S. who would be affected by any governmental action against Tencent.</p><p>Which could be coming. The Trump 2.0 administration will be as unpredictable as it was the first time whenever it comes to dealings with China. We could see this develop into a fill-on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">Huawei-style banning</a> should the president decide to do it. We could also see it just go away if it's shown that Tencent really doesn't belong on this list. That is exactly what happened with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-latest-be-blacklisted-trump-administration">Xiaomi</a> when it was found to have been added in error in 2021.</p><p>Tencent was also in hot water with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">Department of Justice</a>, which claims there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-plans-get-epic-games-antitrust-motion-dismissed">antitrust</a> violations with the way Tencent and Epic Games (Tencent owns 35% of Epic) were running their Board of Directors. This has no direct relationship with the addition to any DoD lists but is ammunition should further action be considered.</p><p>In short, if you use WeChat on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> you don't have anything to worry about yet. Tomorrow, however, is another day.</p>

<ul><li>Shokz announced the OpenFit 2 wireless open-ear earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday.</li><li>The OpenFit 2 have 11 hours of battery per charge, dual low- and high-frequency drivers in each earbud, and IP55 water resistance.</li><li>The new earbuds are 1g heavier but have improved Bluetooth, tweaked earhooks, and a new physical button for controls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Shokz announced the successor to my favorite wireless earbuds at CES 2025 on Tuesday, but it took me three days to see the news. Even though I'm out of the loop, I decided to cover the announcement late. I'm just that excited about it.</p><p>Ever since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> wireless earbuds in late 2023, I've abandoned my old earbuds and worn them almost exclusively. Over a year of wearing them for training runs, hikes, and races, I've grown dependent upon their open-ear fit for keeping my situational awareness and letting my eardrums relax, while acknowledging some annoying flaws with them over time.</p><p>Now it looks like the Shokz OpenFit 2 will fix most (if not all) of my complaints with the first-gen earbuds.</p><p>Like the original OpenFit and the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">OpenFit Air</a>, the OpenFit 2 has a silicone earhook that lets the speaker sit directly over your ear, directing sound inside while leaving it open to hear your surroundings. It's a nice alternative to bone conduction headphones (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a>) if you're not a fan of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Shokz OpenFit have a relatively average battery life, finicky touch controls that frequently lead to dropped phone calls, and softer sound compared to in-ear earbuds. They also sometimes refuse to charge and stay connected to your phone while in the charging case, or die if they sit too long without the case being charged.</p>

<p>I'm waiting to hear back from a Shokz rep if that notorious charging connector issue has been fixed, as the OpenFit 2 charging case has the same look and 48-hour capacity as the first generation. But on every other front, the OpenFit 2 should be a major improvement.</p><p>It jumps from 7 to 11 hours of streaming per charge, with a 270-day standby time in-case instead of 10 days. They've added a physical button with single-, double-, and triple-click shortcuts like pausing music or answering phone calls; now the touchpad only controls volume and your voice assistant, which is a relief.</p><p>Most importantly for audiophiles, it adds two drivers instead of one, targeting lows and highs, with a larger bass driver than before and "OpenBass 2.0" tech to "enhance dynamic low-frequency vibrations directly into your ear."</p><p>I personally felt the OpenFit had good-enough audio quality with the bass boost EQ setting, and cared more about the eardrum comfort and unimpeded awareness than perfect surround sound. The OpenFit 2 will provide a lovely little boost for first-gen fans, but probably won't satisfy those who prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> with a proper seal and artificial transparency modes for richer sound, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2</a>.</p><p>Other new upgrades include a redesigned flexible earhook that's supposed to "ensure a secure fit" with new, softer silicone than before, along with a jump from IP54 to IP55 water resistance (handling water jets instead of splashes) and new Bluetooth 5.4 support for triple the range away from your phone.</p><p>I intend to review the Shokz OpenFit 2 soon and see if they deliver on the company's promised improvements. But consider me quite optimistic, simply because the upgrades seem to directly address many first-gen users' complaints, including mine.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Stay aware and in the zone</strong></em></p><p>The new version of my favorite wireless workout earbuds keep the same DirectPitch audio design that blasts the sound into your ears while keeping them unimpeded, similar to bone conduction earbuds but with more traditional speaker audio. This version costs the same but lasts longer, hits a louder and deeper sound, and can withstand more water and sweat.</p></p>

<p>The Visible Plus plan is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plan</a> that money can buy, coming complete with premium data on Verizon&apos;s 5G Ultra Wideband, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and free smartwatch service (a $10/month value). You also get a ton of international perks, including unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data in Mexico and Canada and free calls to over 30 countries worldwide. </p><p>The carrier will even throw in a free Global Pass day every month (a feature that&apos;s usually reserved for Verizon users). There&apos;s a reason we called Visible a "phenomenal value for heavy users" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>. The Visible Plus plan usually costs $45 per month, but this deal knocks the price down to only $30 monthly for over two years. </p><p>Of course, none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a> are perfect. You won&apos;t get any multi-line discounts if you&apos;re signing up for the whole family, and you&apos;ll want to be in an area with great Verizon coverage to get the most out of the service. But if you&apos;re a heavy data user looking for international perks on a budget, this deal on Visible&apos;s Plus plan is hard to beat. </p>

<ul><li>Samsung's rumored Galaxy S25 Slim arrives at Geekbench, revealing what to expect.</li><li>The device carries the SM-S937U model number and is likely powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>The S25 Slim was also seen featuring 12GB of RAM and running on Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Galaxy S25 series is coming this month, precisely in less than two weeks. While we expect the conventional trio at the launch, a new Galaxy S25 Slim has been long rumored to come alongside the other three handsets.</p><p>According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X, the Galaxy S25 Slim has now hit Geekbench and is believed to be the U.S. version. The benchmark shared by the tipster has revealed notable details about the upcoming rumored handset. The test appears to have been very recent, with the device bearing the <strong>SM-S937U</strong> model number.</p>

<p>Per the shared Geekbench screenshot, the rumored Galaxy S25 Slim, featuring 12GB of RAM, has scored 3005 single-core and 6945 multi-core scores. The device seems to be running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. It is also powered by a Qualcomm chipset, and the architecture indicates that it could be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or an exclusive Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip.</p><p>While the Geekbench indicates that Samsung surely has another device up its sleeve, it is still unclear whether we will see the Galaxy S25 Slim at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">January 22 Unpacked</a> event launch. Earlier rumors indicated we wouldn't be witnessing the launch until Q2 2025.</p>

<p>The Unpacked teaser image, however, hints at four phones stacked together, which could mean we might have a glimpse of the rumored Slim phone or maybe not. Meanwhile, you can head over to our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 guide</a> on what to expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Slim is anticipated to have a thin profile, and it isn't clear what sacrifices Samsung would make to achieve that compared to the flagship Galaxy S25 series trio. On the other hand, the Slim phone is expected to have a triple camera system, even with its slimmer form factor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-camera-specs-details-rumored">Earlier reports</a> indicated that it could carry a 200MP primary lens, like the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra, and even feature two 50MP ultra-wide and telephoto lenses. According to rumors, the S25 Slim might make use of Samsung's recently developed ALoP technology to incorporate powerful cameras even in a smaller package.</p>

<ul><li>A major leak might've left nothing to the imagination about the look of the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The S25 Ultra is the primary culprit of the most drastic changes as the device supposedly sports rounded corners, flat edges/display, and more.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is confirmed to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following a host of other Galaxy S25 rumors, a recent leak might've taken the cover off the look of the new flagship series.</p><p>A major leak, which allegedly contains the "official" renders of the Galaxy S25 series were posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-design">Android Headlines</a> today (Jan 10). The leaked imagery leaves nothing to the imagination, beginning with the Galaxy S25 Ultra model. Renderings of this device were spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">last year in September</a> and what's proposed today aren't <em>that </em>different. The alleged renderings showcase a phone with rounded corners and an entirely flat display and sides.</p><p>A full-frontal look at the phone seemingly showcases relatively thin bezels around the device's entire display. A centered selfie camera is also seen, but that's pretty much expected by this point.</p><p>The leaked renders then show off the back of the device and its quadruple, vertical camera array. The lenses seemingly retain the silver rings around the circumference of the cameras. However, the renders give us yet another look at the black rings on the surface of the cameras, surrounding the lenses.</p><p>This is a change we've seen rumored before, which is in the same vein as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="bxPhxEr4S4yFuA3MharK3A" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-render-back-front" alt="An alleged look at the front and back of the Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bxPhxEr4S4yFuA3MharK3A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication states the Galaxy S25 Ultra could see the following colors upon release: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver.</p><p>On the other hand, the other two siblings in the series: the S25 and the S25 Plus might not receive such a "significant" glow-up. Per the leaked renders, both devices look relatively the same as the S24 alternatives. Each device features rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thin bezels. However, the only suggested change is with the lenses as those could grab the same black rings as the Ultra model.</p>

<p>The post claims the base and S25 Plus models could see the following colors: Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint.</p><p>This alleged in-depth look at the next trio arrives quite quickly after a major leak dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">the entire spec sheet</a> of the S25 series. The Ultra sibling is rumored to grab a 6.9-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For its cameras, the device could see a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto.</p><p>A 5,000mAh battery is suspected to arrive within the device to empower your days with 45W fast charging to boot.</p><p>For the other two, the S25 could see a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch display for the Plus model.</p><p>Either way, with so much information to chew through, this could hold us over until the official launch of the series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">on January 22</a>.</p>

<p>A few late leaks suggest what consumers can expect from Samsung's next Ultra model's camera in terms of features and AI.</p><p>Two separate lists were posted on X by Egyptian tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/1877589986154869029">Ahmed Qwaider</a>, who claimed that Samsung is boosting the Galaxy S25 Ultra's camera with new AI software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-more-camera-features-leak-3515455/">Android Authority</a>). The machine-translated post states the next Ultra model's camera could benefit from "higher screen color" and an increased "brightness rate of 43%."</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AhmedQwaider888/status/1877594739484074212">could build on</a> its AI-based editing tools for its camera with "Auto Eraser." The tipster claims this feature will let users "remove annoying sounds in the video."</p>

<p>Continuing with videography, the tipster claims the S25 Ultra will give users "control" over the colors of a video and allow you to record in "raw colors," as well. More importantly, the post states that users can swap between camera focal lengths when filming "without cutting or lagging" your final product. The tipster states this is a result of increased frames on the device's recording side.</p><p>Samsung is allegedly boosting the resolution capabilities of the S25 Ultra for "less noise." Moreover, the device's macro mode is supposedly receiving an upgrade for better clarity.</p><p>Likely, several of the S25 Ultra's camera enhancements and AI tools are a result of Samsung's One UI 7 software and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>. The former recently entered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a>, which hauled in fixes for a load of issues that plagued testers early on. The software has been rumored to drop near or alongside the Galaxy S25 this month.</p><p>Regarding the S25 Ultra's cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fresh-leak-suggests-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-get-a-major-camera-boost">rumors claim</a> the device could grab a major boost with a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide camera, a 3x zoom 50MP telephoto camera, and a 50MP super-telephoto camera with 5x zoom capabilities. Recently, another batch of rumors allege the device could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-low-light-video-improvements">shine in low-light situations</a>. It's purported that the phone's videography side could let users record better videos with more clarity and color without an abundance of light.</p><p>The feature is rumored to heavily rely on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Qualcomm seemingly confirmed</a> will arrive inside the series.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is confirmed to debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">during Unpacked</a> on January 22.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra specs leak before the launch.</li><li>All models will include at least 12GB of RAM and storage options, including 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.</li><li>All three models’ specs indicate minimal changes over the predecessors on paper.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung recently announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">launch date</a> of the most anticipated Galaxy S25 series, which is less than two weeks away. A new leak has revealed every possible spec of the trio before the launch.</p><p>The leak comes from Steve Hemmerstoffer in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specifications">Android Headlines</a>, and it shows all the specifications of the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The Ultra, the premium model, will be powered by the latest and greatest Qualcomm chip—the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>—the same one that was featured in the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and will likely see its way into most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> of 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Back in September, in collab with @Androidheadline, I provided the very first and early look at the #GalaxyS25 Series.In addition, today we joined forces again to bring you #GalaxyS25 #GalaxyS25Plus #GalaxyS25Ultra full specs sheets!😏You're welcome👉🏻 https://t.co/qRMywd6X3b pic.twitter.com/GCVrLKcvSa<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877692152173482475">January 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The same chipset is shared across the Galaxy S25 trio, at least for the U.S. region. The Ultra will have a flat display like the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, measuring 6.9 inches, with a WQHD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The storage options, on the other hand, according to the tipster, will include at least 12GB of RAM, and consumers get to choose between 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage variants. Further, the handset will have the same 5000mAh battery as the previous iteration, supporting 45W fast charging.</p><p>Lastly, for optics, the premium handset will incorporate a 200MP primary camera paired with a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and another 10MP telephoto shooter. For selfies, users will get a 12MP shooter.</p><p>Per the leaked specs and prior <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">renders leaked</a> earlier, the Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be a minimal upgrade when it comes to the overall look at the specs — yet there should be a significant amount of improvements in terms of performance — thanks to the new Qualcomm SoC.</p>

<p>The other two shorter siblings of the Ultra —the Galaxy S25, and S25 Plus, share most of the specs and design, as per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-plus-leaked-alleged-rendering">leaked renders</a>. Both models will also be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and carry the same storage options as the Ultra model.</p><p>The standard Galaxy S25 will feature a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display, while the S25 Plus model, on the other hand, will feature a 6.7-inch display with a WQHD resolution.</p><p>The S25 Plus will have a 4900mAh battery capacity, and the shorter Galaxy S25 will feature a 4000mAh battery. They also support 45W and 25W wired charging, respectively.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S25 and the S25 Plus will have a triple camera array featuring a 50MP primary lens next to a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 10MP telephoto lens. Both handsets will also have a 12MP selfie shooter on the front.</p><p>Other interesting features across all three models include Android 15-based One UI 7, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3. Lastly, here are all the expected measurements of all three models from the lineup:</p>
<ul><li>Galaxy S25 — 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm, weight 162 grams.</li><li>Galaxy S25 Plus —158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3mm, weight 190 grams.</li><li>Galaxy S25 Ultra — 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm, weight 218 grams.</li></ul>
<p>While these specs pretty much look like the real deal, we ought to take these leaks with a grain of salt until the official announcement later this month at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked</a>.

<p>Samsung is starting its year with a fresh patch of updates for its devices. The company's security update came in hot with about 51 patches that include 21 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures(SVEs), which are specific to Samsung. The rest of the 29 patches are Android bug fixes.</p><p>These patches aim to improve the security of the devices as part of Samsung's monthly Security Maintenance Release (SMR) process. The update was first rolled out to the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in South Korea for users who have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out" target="_blank">One UI 7 Beta 3</a> update. Today (Jan. 9), the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Z Fold 4, and Galaxy Z Fold SE received the security update.</p><p>A bulk of these patches focused on blocking vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to read or execute codes on the user's device without permission, and one of them even changed the configuration of device notifications without the user's knowledge on Android versions 12, 13, and 14.

<p>While Samsung didn't disclose what these vulnerabilities exactly were, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb" target="_blank">patch changelog</a> mentions five "Critical" level fixes alongside 24 "High" level fixes. They address issues with Samsung’s  Messages, Notification Manager, and Bootloader.</p><p>As of today, this security patch is available only on carrier-locked units in the U.S. and all devices in South Korea. However, according to its website, Samsung plans on releasing this update to all above-mentioned devices globally and said that "delivery time of security patches may vary depending on the regions and models."</p><p>Users can check for an update on their devices by heading to <strong>Settings ></strong> <strong>System & updates > Security update</strong>.

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung could drop Bluetooth connectivity from the S Pen of the new Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>If true, a tipster on X claims that the stylus would lose "gestures" and "remote control" functions, such as those for the phone's camera.</li><li>Samsung's previous Ultra models could pair with multiple S Pens and styluses, granting users alternate options.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is preparing to debut on January 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent rumor suggests Samsung's next S Pen might be a disappointing facet with its upcoming Ultra model.</p><p>The information was posted by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1877621301583474842">Ishan Agarwal</a>, who claims the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen could drop its (typically expected) Bluetooth connectivity (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/10/galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-without-bluetooth/">9to5Google</a>). The user states they discovered this supposed loss of connectivity via "retail sources," but fails to cite those sources.</p><p>However, this possible loss of Bluetooth could indicate that the next Ultra model's S Pen will lose some of its features. Agarwal claims the stylus would force users to lose "gestures and remote control" on the next Ultra.</p><p>The folks at 9to5 speculate that the removal of Bluetooth could be a "cost-cutting" measure by Samsung. Moreover, the removal of such connectivity would negate the necessity of charging it within the S25 Ultra. This was a sentiment the tipster discussed in their X thread; however, if this is true, it seems more like a "take it or leave it" scenario.</p><p>The tipster claims the removal of Bluetooth may only provide a measly "15 to 20-minute" addition of battery life to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will no longer feature Bluetooth according to retail sources!Which means you will lose certain features like gestures & remote control.How do you feel about this downgrade? #GalaxyS25Ultra pic.twitter.com/ASDKB06nsx<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1877621301583474842">January 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The S Pen has continued to be a useful tool for Galaxy Ultra users who want to write by hand, especially if it's for note-taking. Typically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-galaxy-s24-work-with-the-s-pen">like on the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, the S Pen can turn your handwritten words into digital text for messages, text extraction from photos, coloring, and more. Interestingly, one "remote control" feature the S25 Ultra may lose is the ability for the S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10000758/#:~:text=Capture%20photos%20and%20screenshots">to control its camera shutter</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Ultra and the S Pen typically featured a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-galaxy-s24-work-with-the-s-pen#:~:text=Which%20S%20Pens%20work%20with%20the%20Galaxy%20S24%20Ultra%3F">pairing function</a>. Users could pair multiple styluses to the device, in case they wanted to swap to another that could do more or things differently. What the current rumors propose could see that go away with the next iteration.</p><p>With the recent S Pen rumors, perhaps the Korean OEM will deliver additional features for the stylus via One UI 7. The OS skin entered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second beta</a> before Christmas, which fixed a host of malfunctions and errors across the S24 series.</p><p>Elsewhere, Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">seemingly confirmed</a> that the Galaxy S25 series will rock its Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset ahead of its January 22 launch. Samsung will host its usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">Unpacked event</a> where we should see the next flagship trio and, maybe, even more surprises.</p>

<ul><li>People on iOS might soon have an enhancing privacy feature on Google Chrome.</li><li>YouTube Incognito links are likely to open in Chrome Incognito mode. This helps users prevent the browser from saving their watching history.</li><li>It is also likely to help users avoid receiving unwanted advertisements as the feature also eliminates tracking.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome on iOS is developing a new feature to increase privacy when using YouTube Incognito mode.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mspoweruser.com/chrome-ios-to-open-youtube-incognito-links-directly-in-incognito/">MSPowerUser</a>, a new feature might soon be introduced into Chrome for iOS users. This feature will open YouTube Incognito links directly in the browser's Incognito mode as a significant privacy measure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR" name="YouTube-LifeStyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="YouTube on Galaxy Z Fold 2 with toys around it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2eVc334fHSBSNuLipjwTqR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The evidence was found through a new Chrome flag through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6152054/3">Chromium Gerrit</a>, which indicates, "Enable the opening of links from YouTube incognito in Chrome incognito." Enabling it will open up YouTube Incognito links directly through Chrome Incognito.</p><p>Whenever the feature goes official, it enhances privacy for users, as Chrome doesn't store browsing history. This wasn't the case earlier when YouTube Incognito links opened in regular Chrome and were not in Incognito mode.</p>
<p>MSPowerUser further notes that users will see a bottom sheet message indicating that they are in Chrome Incognito, and they will see "Chrome automatically opens YouTube incognito links in Incognito." The indication is pretty similar to what we are used to on the YouTube Incognito screen, with a similar indication at the bottom.</p><p>Alongside the privacy aspect of the upcoming new feature, it also helps users with data tracking, usually done through a web browser, including Chrome. Since it is incognito, it is one less thing to worry about, as it also saves from unwanted advertisements. Users have to bear in mind that the feature on the Chrome browser only applies to YouTube Incognito links and not to videos.</p><p>All in all, the upcoming feature on Chrome on iOS is a component of the search giant's larger initiative to enhance user control and online privacy. It is still unclear whether the feature will eventually debut on Google Chrome browsers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. If it does, it will be a nifty addition.</p>

<ul><li>Google is widely rolling new feature for its popular Quick Share tool on Android devices.</li><li>Quick Share users can now take advantage of a new QR code option to send their files to other users.</li><li>Recipient can quickly scan the QR code to get the files through a link.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Quick Share is a nifty equivalent to Apple's AirDrop for Android users. While it has been around on Android handsets for a while, the quick sharing functionality is adding new means to share files with other users.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users can now share files through Quick Share with the help of a QR code, which will make receiving files by the recipients hassle-free and also make it more secure. This feature happened to be rolling out widely (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/quick-share-qr-code-rolling-out/">9to5Google</a>) when it was announced last month and was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-quick-share-speedier-sharing-option-tipped">spotted back</a> in May last year.</p>
<p>Up until now, users who wanted to share photos or files had to turn on the Quick Share feature either to their Contacts or for everyone nearby, which showcases the device's availability to almost any Android device nearby. However, the new QR code-sharing users can now tap on the "User QR code" feature, which will be visible in the "Send to nearby devices" pane.</p><p>Tapping it further will reveal the QR code alongside the number and types of files that a user wants to send. The recipient can now scan the code from their Android phone and click on the quick share link (<u>quick share.google</u>) to get the original files. There is also a nifty prompt over the QR code indicating that the Android phone recipient should scan the respective code.</p>
<p>It eliminates the need to keep searching for contacts or pairing for new devices nearby, as scanning a QR code is a bit easier. Also, the QR code can be read by more than one Android device, which means multiple users nearby can benefit from quickly receiving the original files, which can be a savior in gatherings or at events.</p><p>Android users on the latest version of Quick Share (version <strong>24.49.33</strong>) will be able to see the functionality on their devices, as the rollout has just begun.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OnePlus had a strong 2024 on the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">12R</a>, and it is looking to emulate a similar success this year. The OnePlus 13 introduces a bold new design, better cameras, and a larger battery — all while being thinner than last year's phone. The software is also much better this time around, and although you don't get a clean interface, it is fluid and doesn't have many bugs.<br> <br>I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and think it has the potential to be one of the best phones of 2025. That said, the phone is costlier by $100, edging it ever closer to what Google and Samsung charge. If you don't want to shell out that much cash, there's an alternative — the OnePlus 13R. <br><br>Just like last year, the OnePlus 13R is launching globally, and that's absolutely the right call — there's obviously a lot of interest in the device outside India and China. Also, the  OnePlus 12R continues to be the best mid-range phone you can buy, and the 13R builds on that foundation, delivering increased performance by way of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and a bigger 6,000mAh battery. <br><br>OnePlus is making considerable changes to the imaging as well, with the phone featuring a new 50MP main camera and a dedicated 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom. With these upgrades comes a price hike, and the OnePlus 13R costs $100 more as a result in North America and the U.K. Thankfully, Indian buyers don't need to worry about paying more, as the device costs the same as the 12R a year ago. <br><br>Does the OnePlus 13R do enough to retain its mantle as the best value flagship? I used the phone as my daily driver for two weeks, and here's what I think.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-pricing-and-retail-availability"><span>OnePlus 13R: Pricing and retail availability</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pRatN24iays3TBpVAMU3Yo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRatN24iays3TBpVAMU3Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R was unveiled on January 10, 2025, and the phone is now available to buy in India, the U.S., U.K., and select global markets. Like last year, OnePlus is selling the phone in 256GB and 512GB storage variants, but North American buyers will just get the 256GB model. <br><br>Thankfully, the base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage, and it gets UFS 4.0 storage as standard — unlike last year. This model costs $599 in the U.S., £599 in the U.K., and ₹42,999 ($501) in India. The 16GB/512GB variant is debuting at ₹49,999 ($582) in India, and you get the usual launch incentives. <br><br>While the device costs more in the U.S. and U.K., that isn't the case in India; OnePlus tends to be aggressive in the country in this category, and I think it is a good value considering the hardware you're getting.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-design"><span>OnePlus 13R: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone launching these days, the OnePlus 13R switches to a flat aesthetic with boxy sides. While the OnePlus 13 also has a similar design, that phone has beveled edges that make it comfortable to hold and use. You don't get the same on the 13R, and it doesn't have anywhere close to the same in-hand feel.<br> <br>The sides tend to dig into your palm, and while it is technically lighter than the OnePlus 13, it doesn't feel that way when holding both phones. It's thinner as well at 8mm, but the boxier sides minimize that effect — I like the in-hand feel of the 12R much better to this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VWvQph3sxN3sbps5fqjTWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VWvQph3sxN3sbps5fqjTWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the design at the back highly interesting; the Astral Trail model has a set of rings etched into the glass that looks cool, and the camera housing has a cleaner design than previous years. The mid-frame uses aluminum, and there's a clear difference in the sturdiness of the device over the 12R.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JvuCo8FKKsfmHDTU5vySUo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvuCo8FKKsfmHDTU5vySUo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need a matte texture, the 13R is also available in a Nebula Noir color variant, but that model doesn't quite have the same striking design at the back. The alert slider is intact, and it easily allows you to switch between ring, vibrate, and silent profiles without too much of a hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VQv5iyDFgabdbsp6WLsGSo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQv5iyDFgabdbsp6WLsGSo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the slider continues to be a differentiator, I don't like the OxygenOS 15 bundles calls and notifications into a single category in Do Not Disturb; if you enable DND but want calls to come through (as I do), there's no way to set it up. Every other manufacturer has calls and messages split into different categories, and that needs to be the case in OxygenOS as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2Go567yuhr6q9JpANpM5Wo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Go567yuhr6q9JpANpM5Wo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the OnePlus 13 gets a new ultrasonic fingerprint module, the 13R has an optical unit instead, and it is positioned too low on the screen, making it awkward to access when holding the phone one-handed. The module was higher up than usual last year, and that made it uncomfortable as well, and OnePlus course-corrected too much this time, putting it too low on the panel — now we'll need to wait and see if next year's phone has it in the goldilocks zone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8awathS2xkGKRdzyEX3BWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8awathS2xkGKRdzyEX3BWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get IP65 dust and water resistance, and while that is decent enough in its own right, it isn't quite as effective as IP68 or IP67 that's used by a few manufacturers in this category. While there are a few quibbles with the design, the OnePlus 13R looks better than last year, and more importantly, it is more durable.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-display"><span>OnePlus 13R: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Zmt4FvJ4mJJ3iTgn4HZZYo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zmt4FvJ4mJJ3iTgn4HZZYo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus retained the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as last year, but it is flat this time; it goes up to 120Hz and has a maximum brightness of 1600 nits in HBM. There's Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and interestingly, the panel is protected by Corning's new Gorilla Glass 7i, which has increased scratch resistance. <br><br>As you get the same BOE panel, I didn't see any issues with color vibrancy or contrast levels. The panel gets bright enough in daily use, and even under harsh sunlight, I didn't notice any problems. It doesn't get quite as bright as the Pixel 9 Pro or Vivo X200 Pro, but you'll only notice the difference when using the 13R next to these devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GJB8GVM2MbhXu9rpauJD" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJB8GVM2MbhXu9rpauJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a decent amount of customizability with the panel when it comes to adjusting color balance, and OxygenOS has the best always-on styles you can get on any phone, with unique options that allow you to tailor the lock screen to your tastes. And just like the OnePlus 13, you get Aqua Touch on the 13R, which gives you the ability to use the phone when there's water on the screen.</p>
<p>Gaming is similarly enjoyable, and while you don't get 120fps on the device, it does an admirable job at 60fps with most titles. The one positive is that BGMI goes up to 120fps using frame interpolation, but it has jitter at times. Stereo sound is detailed enough that you can use the onboard audio for casual gaming, but I recommend using earbuds if you're listening to music — the OnePlus Buds 3 continue to be a terrific choice in this regard.</p>

<p>OnePlus messed up with the storage variants last year, incorrectly stating that the 256GB version had UFS 4.0 storage. It's addressing those shortcomings with the 13R, with the phone now offering 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage on the base model. Indian buyers also get a 512GB model, and this variant also gets UFS 4.0 storage. <br><br>There's good news on the hardware side as well, with the phone powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It is just as capable as last year, and continues to deliver outstanding performance — I'm yet to see any games challenge the chipset. There is thermal throttling after the 30-minute mark, but the phone has a higher threshold than the regular OnePlus 13; I noticed it going up to 47 degrees in extended testing, whereas the OnePlus 13 didn't go beyond 42.2 degrees.</p>

<p>I didn't encounter any lag or slowdowns in the two weeks I used the phone, and it held its own in demanding games as well. Annoyingly, there's no eSIM connectivity on the phone, but you get OnePlus's new BeaconLink standard that builds on Bluetooth, delivering increased range of up to 100 ft. <br><br>The rationale for not including eSIM is that it doesn't get much use in countries like India — where the phone will see a bulk of its sales — but the manufacturer is betting on BeaconLink as a new standard that has potential, so it's included instead. Thankfully, the phone doesn't miss out in other areas, and you get a good Wi-Fi 7 modem, Bluetooth 5.4, AptX HD, LHDC, NFC, and dual-band GPS. This is easily one of the best hardware packages you'll find in the sub-$700 category, and barring the omission of eSIM, there isn't anything to fault.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I easily got a day and a half out of the OnePlus 12R's battery, and the 13R manages to last two days thanks to a bigger 6000mAh battery. Even with heavy use, the phone managed to last over a day and a half, and I averaged two days in regular use. This is the case on other devices I tested recently that had 6000mAh batteries as well, and I'm excited that we're at a point where you no longer need to charge your phone daily. <br><br>Unlike the OnePlus 13, the 13R doesn't have silicon-carbon tech, and instead uses a single 6000mAh cell. As it no longer uses dual cells, it takes considerably longer to charge the device. In my testing, the phone took just over 55 minutes to charge using the bundled 80W charger — 17 minutes more than the OnePlus 13. <br><br>Obviously, the charging time isn't ideal, but it is still better than what you get with Samsung and Google phones, and there's a charger bundled in the package. The downside with the phone is that you don't get wireless charging, but seeing as how I don't use it at all, it isn't as big a limitation.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is using a 50MP Sony LYT-700 imaging sensor as the main camera on the 13R, and it's joined by a 50MP Samsung JN5 telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom and an 8MP wide-angle lens that uses Sony's IMX355 module. The tele lens is limited in its usability as a 3x sensor would have been much better, and in a similar vein, the wide-angle lens needs a better sensor. <br><br>The camera interface itself is identical to last year, but you get a ton of new AI-assisted editing features that do a good job. Just like the regular OnePlus 13, all three modules at the back can shoot 4K60 video, but the video quality itself isn't as good. The phone does a better job shooting photos of moving objects, and you can take live photos that retain motion even when you move the images over to iOS.</p>

<p>Although you don't get any Hasselblad tuning, the OnePlus 13R delivers photos that look similar to the OnePlus 13, which was the case last year as well. The wide-angle lens doesn't quite manage to deliver the same vibrancy of photos, and again, this was something the 12R struggled with. The resultant images are decent enough, but you don't get the same detail, and there's visible noise in low-light situations.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ec3764ba-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>Shots taken in daylight have good colors and detail, but they have higher levels of contrast, and foliage rendition isn't as natural. That said, the resultant shots look great in their own right, and there isn't that big a difference in this scenario.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=ffb1448e-cf47-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>It's in low-light conditions where the OnePlus 13R struggles to hold against the standard model. It boosts the exposure to eke out additional detail, and in doing so you get colors that look washed out at times, visible grain, and aggressive smoothing at the edges.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=14f00de4-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>That said, the phone does a good enough job if there's some artificial lighting.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="480" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=40eb9d00-cf48-11ef-9397-d93975fe8866"></iframe>
<p>On the whole, the device manages to deliver one of the best cameras in its category. It's a letdown that the auxiliary modules aren't quite as good, but other than that, this is a great showing. Unless you need the additional versatility that you get with the 3x lens on the OnePlus 13, this is a good enough choice if you're looking to save some cash.</p>

<p>Software has been a point of contention for OnePlus in the last three years, but the OnePlus 13R doesn't have any shortcomings in this area. The device runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a> based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and it is just as fluid as the OnePlus 13 — and has the same feature-set. <br><br>There's a sprinkling of AI thrown in for good measure this time, but as is always the case with these things, the usability is dubious. Like most other manufacturers, OnePlus is using a mix of on-device LLMs and cloud servers, and there's a dedicated section in the settings that lets you see all the features available. <br><br>The interface is fast and doesn't have any slowdowns or bugs, and it's refreshing to be able to say that about a new version of OxygenOS. There's good customizability (as always), and the latest iteration of the software brings a slew of lock screen styling options, and they look great.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, I don't really have much to point out. I didn't see any issues with notifications or aggressive battery management, and the device does a great job with the basics. The only quibble is that the UI is heavily customized, but that's the case with most phones other than Pixels, and if anything, I prefer OxygenOS to MIUI. <br><br>Coming to updates, the device will get four years of software updates and six years of security updates. OnePlus basically made it clear last year that this would be the maximum it would offer on its devices, and while it isn't on the same level as Google and Samsung, it's still decent enough.</p>

<p>What's so good about the OnePlus 13R is that it is positioned in a segment where you don't have many devices. I like what Vivo is doing with the V series, and the V40 Pro has the best cameras in this category, and the sleek design is a differentiator as well. That said, it isn't anywhere as fast as the 13R, nor does the battery last as long. <br><br>The Reno 13 Pro is a good choice to consider as well, with the device touting great cameras and a long-lasting battery. It doesn't quite have the same power, but that's about the only limitation, and it is quite similar to the 13R in regular use.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13r-should-you-buy-it"><span>OnePlus 13R: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a mid-range phone with the best hardware</li><li>You want a phone that lasts two days between charges</li><li>You need a great camera</li><li>You want fluid software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need great auxiliary cameras</li><li>You want a watertight design</li></ul>
<p>I called the OnePlus 12R the bargain of the year in 2024, and if anything, the OnePlus 13R does more to deserve that title this year. The phone delivers better performance, has a bigger battery, double the amount of storage, takes better photos in challenging situations, and will get more software updates. You're paying the same as last year's model while getting a decent set of upgrades, and I call that a win. <br><br>The cameras are among the best in its category, and OnePlus nailed the software as well this time, rolling out plenty of AI features you'll actually end up using. Just like the standard OnePlus 13, there isn't anything inherently wrong with the 13R, and the only limitation I've come across is that the auxiliary cameras aren't on the same level as the main sensor. Outside of that and IP68 water resistance, you don't have anything missing here. <br><br>If anything, I'd suggest getting the OnePlus 13R instead of the OnePlus 13 if you don't need the absolute best cameras. There really isn't any other device that offers quite the same caliber of hardware in this category, and for the second year in a row, OnePlus managed to deliver the best value flagship.</p>

<p>Google announced Android XR at a surprise event in December 2024, unveiling the first version of Android built for AR and VR devices. Just as the term "smartphone" encompasses several different form factors — slabs, folding phones, etc. — XR is the combination of AR and VR under one umbrella term.</p><p>While Android XR is a bit late to the game, Google has the chance to learn from Meta and Apple. From everything we've seen so far, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a> looks to be the perfect combination between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Meta's Horizon OS</a>, which powers Meta Quest headsets, and Apple's Vision OS on the Apple Vision Pro.</p><p>But while Google looks like it has figured out the operating system side of things, we still don't have any proper product announcements. That's going to change in 2025, and I fully expect to see at least one flagship VR/mixed reality headset and one pair of AR glasses make a commercial debut. We also know about a few other projects in the works, so here's what you can expect from Android XR in 2025.</p>

<p>The first major Android XR product launch I expect in 2025 is from Xreal. The company has already proven itself as the market leader in smart display glasses segment and has launched two full-fledged standalone smart glasses products to date — Beam, and Beam Pro. Beam Pro redefined the company's standalone solution in 2024, and I believe Xreal will continue to evolve this concept with its first Android XR product.</p><p>Xreal Beam Pro looks a lot like an Android smartphone with dual ports on the bottom. I expect the first pair of Android XR-powered smart glasses from Xreal to replace this design with a "compute puck" similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> is using. I don't expect it to be wireless like Orion's puck, as Xreal would likely prioritize battery life and comfort by putting the battery in the compute puck.</p><p>I also don't think the compute puck will feature a display, as Android XR is built to display an XR user interface rather than a traditional flat-screen Android UI. As such, the puck will only function when the glasses are attached, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/spacetop-g1">that one Xreal-powered laptop</a> that got canceled.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1980px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Pr5HopUsbmpN3BxEnFVwr4" name="spatial-ui-panels" alt="An Android XR UI design template provided by Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pr5HopUsbmpN3BxEnFVwr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1980" height="1114" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I still expect the glasses to have a custom piece of silicon inside, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One</a>, the company's recently updated smart display glasses. Xreal One has an optional camera coming out soon, but I expect Xreal's first Android XR glasses to have cameras built in for full spatial tracking. I got a glimpse of this future at MWC 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">when I went hands-on</a> with Xreal Air 2 Ultra, which featured a very beta custom UI, full 6DoF tracking, and rudimentary hand tracking support.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Xreal Android XR glasses will almost certainly use a compute puck that sits in your pocket or is clipped somewhere else on your body.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With Android XR powering the experience, hand tracking will be flawless and the UI will look gorgeous. I'm quite confident in Xreal's ability to deliver excellent hardware at this point, and fully expect Xreal's Android XR glasses to challenge Meta Orion in a serious way.</p><p>While the ultimate goal of Android XR smart glasses will almost certainly be to replace your phone, I think initial versions from companies like Xreal will mainly be focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">providing a neck-saving experience</a> for entertainment and productivity on the go.</p><p>When will we see Xreal Android XR glasses? I believe we'll see them debut at Google I/O 2025, which is typically held in May. Google I/O is the company's annual developer conference, and what better way to encourage development for a new Android platform than to fully debut it and a new set of products than at a developer conference? I can't think of one.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung"><span>Samsung</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to years of leaks, Samsung and Google had originally planned to launch its first mixed reality headset powered by Android XR sometime in the latter half of 2024. That all changed when Apple unveiled the Vision Pro in the summer of 2023, which seemingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-headset-reportedly-delayed" target="_blank">compelled Samsung to go back to the drawing board</a> to make a more compelling device.</p><p>The result is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. We don't know the final product name for it just yet but we do know Samsung plans to release it commercially sometime later this year. That's a full year late, but it absolutely means we're going to get a better product because of it.</p><p>Samsung aims to deliver a cutting-edge product that looks like a melding of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> and Apple Vision Pro into a (hopefully) more affordable headset. It sports the same ski goggles-like form factor as these two products and even uses a similar magnetic light blocker system and halo-style strap as the Quest Pro, which I still find to be the most comfortable VR headset for long-term use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because Samsung waited a bit, it's able to fix the biggest problems with the Vision Pro and Quest Pro, namely by delivering an ideal balance between price, performance, and long-term comfort. Moreover, unlike Apple, Samsung will be launching its headset with motion-tracked controllers instead of relying entirely on hand tracking.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is using the Job Simulator developers to help give its headsets a unique personality that we'll see later this year.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Google has already tapped into its long history with XR development by getting Owlchemy Labs — creators of the infinitely popular Job Simulator VR game — to create the onboarding experience for Android XR. Owlchemy built this new experience in the Job Simulator world and, appropriately, calls it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://owlchemylabs.com/blog/save-jobbot-from-reality-in-owlchemy-labs-new-android-xr-title-inside-job">Inside [JOB]</a>.</p><p>Google's use of Owlchemy Labs for this project feels like the "good old Google" that had fun creating projects and pouring lots of character into them. That, combined with Samsung's hardware expertise and what we've seen of the incredibly polished Android XR, gives me high hopes that we'll finally have a good standalone VR headset to compete with Meta's seemingly unstoppable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3" target="_blank">Quest 3 domination</a>.</p><p>While Project Moohan <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-and-mixed-reality-prototypes-remind-us-not-to-get-excited-too-early">is just a prototype</a>, hands-on demos from Google's Android XR event give us a good idea of what we should expect when the final headset makes its debut, which I expect to happen later this Summer at the second Samsung Unpacked of 2025. This is usually where Samsung unveils its latest foldable phones, smartwatches, and other wearables, which, this year, should include a wearable mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>Google has also partnered with Sony, Lynx, and Magic Leap to debut Android XR devices in the near future, but we know next to nothing about what any of these companies are working on. At the least, I can surmise what each company might do based on existing products.</p><p>Magic Leap will, undoubtedly, make a new pair of AR glasses that'll be powered by Android XR instead of the OS that powers existing Magic Leap glasses. Magic Leap was the first AR company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-magic-leap-partnership">that partnered with Google last year</a> to help build Android XR. It makes sense, then, that Magic Leap will at least tease a new pair of AR glasses this year.</p><p>Sony is known in the XR space mainly for PlayStation VR, but the company also announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">a new mixed reality headset</a> last January for enterprise customers but has yet to properly release it. That headset — now called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/vr-ar/i-just-tried-sonys-new-xr-headset-concept-at-ces-2025-but-its-not-what-youd-expect">Sony XYN</a> — is powered by the same Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset that powers Samsung's Project Moohan (detailed above), so it would make sense for Sony to build another version of this headset using Google's new XR OS and give it a wider audience than who it's currently made for.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Three other major companies, Lynx, Sony, and Magic Leap, are also expected to debut Android XR products this year, but those may not make store shelves.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And that just leaves Lynx. The company's first headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lynx-r.com/" target="_blank">Lynx R1</a>, soft-launched in the spring of 2024 to a handful of early financial backers. The headset featured cutting-edge "no latency" mixed reality vision and is also powered by a Snapdragon XR2 chipset, although the R1 never went into mass production.</p><p>It's entirely likely that the company is working with Google to properly launch a headset built upon similar tech in the R1 but using a newer Snapdragon chipset and Android XR on the backend. That helps the company with the app support it needs to ensure a rich experience and help Google to launch a healthy Android XR product portfolio by the end of 2025.</p>
<h2 id="bridging-the-gap-2">Bridging the gap</h2>
<p>Android XR feels like the beginning of Android back in 2008. Much of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZZ-R3p_w8">original public announcement</a> talked about how fragmented the space was and how one company (Google) could bring them all together with an OS that helps set standards and define the user experience.</p><p>Meta is trying the same thing at the same time, but Google has nearly 2 decades of experience building a platform that works on thousands of devices. The company absolutely can deliver on the promise of an OS that bridges the gap between different types of hardware and delivers a stellar experience for anything you want it to do, and we can't wait to see what the first real product brings this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-137">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is starting to develop a feature in Photos that lets users decide which faces they'd like to "see more" of in Memories.</li><li>The feature was reportedly spotted in version 7.12 of the Photos app and is placed alongside the "hide faces" option in a picture's description box.</li><li>Google Photos is also opened its early waitlist for its upcoming "Ask Photos" feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a way for people to surface the memories they'd love to see the most in Photos.</p><p>A discovery by notable X tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/photos-memories-show-more-3514639/">Android Authority</a>), a recent update for Photos reportedly contains details about an upcoming feature refresh. Per the tipster, Google is seemingly working on a way to make faces you'd love to see more of in Photos a little easier. According to the teardown, when viewing a picture in Photos, users can navigate to its information description containing the time it was taken, the lens used, and more.</p><p>There, users will also see small snapshots of the faces and people in the photo that the app recognizes.</p><p>The tipster's test shows that users may soon be able to long-press a person's icon and see a new pop-up menu. The app's code shows a new option: "Show more in memories." This button joins the "hide face from memories" option, an update the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-hide-faces-3465522/">picked up last year</a>, per the publication.</p><p>What's unclear in this early test is if the "show more" option will deliver a pop-up menu like the "hide face" choice. Memories typically creates a collage of a user's photos that can be grouped. The post states that the "hide face" option lets users decide to show "less" of a person's face, but they will still show in grouped collections. However, the alternative involves not showing the person at all, even in grouped situations.</p><p>With the (happier) "show more" function in development, perhaps there will be more in store for users who want to relive certain memories of specific people. Maybe users can have the app create curated collages of a singular person or photos with both parties in them. We'll have to wait and see as more concrete details weren't readily available.</p>

<p>The good thing about this previous "show less" change is that it removes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://proof.vanilla.tools/androidcentral/articles/edit/B6GNTpjPbYXRdwSS3oTnbB">long list of steps</a> previously needed for a simple task. More importantly, there was never a way for users to show <em>more </em>of who they would like to see. The company pushed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-memories-view-rollout">new Memories view</a> during the summer of 2023, alongside a few AI-powered tools. With generative AI at its heart, the tab "curates and organizes" your picture together, so long as they're similar. These similarities can include people, places, and occasions (like parties).</p><p>The AI will also generate a quick title, which users can fix later.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Google opened its early test waitlist for its AI-backed "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" feature in September. This will bring even more of its software to the app by letting users converse with its AI model about content stored in their photo galleries.</p>

Pick up the Samsung watch today and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YL96ND"><strong>you&apos;ll score a whopping 35% discount</strong></a> on the LTE version, knocking the price down to $423.99. As of writing, there are only 13 watches left in stock, so I&apos;d jump on this deal quickly if you&apos;re looking for a new wearable. </p>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> we've ever used, the biggest issue we had with the Galaxy Watch Ultra was its price. Fortunately, a third-party deal has come along and knocked a shocking 35% off the premium wearable, making it a much easier pill to swallow. </p>
<p>As you probably know already, discounts from third-party sellers at Amazon can come and go <em>extremely </em>quickly, so act fast if this deal piques your interest. </p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a fantastic smartwatch with a rugged construction, bright, vivid display, and all of the intelligent hardware upgrades that you&apos;d want in a modern wearable. There&apos;s a ton of accurate health and fitness tracking features, plus you get dual band GPS, built-in LTE support, and up to 100 hours of battery life (in power saving mode). </p><p>Sure, the bulky design isn&apos;t for everyone, and the cost may be prohibitive compared to other watches (even with a discount), but if you want one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best wearable experiences</a> that Samsung has ever introduced, now&apos;s your chance. </p>

<ul><li>In an internal memo, Google CEO Sundar Pichai previewed what employees should expect for 2025.</li><li>After viewing demos, Pichai was impressed by the "amazing" progress Google is making with new AI features.</li><li>A few things Google could release in 2025 are full-fledged Gemini 2.0 models and Project Astra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last year, Google began 2024 with mass layoffs, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/more-job-cuts-on-the-horizon-for-google-says-ceo-sundar-pichai">its CEO Sundar Pichai had to send internal memos to employees</a> explaining the company's plan. At the start of 2025, it looks like Google is in a very different place, as an internal memo from Pichai viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/sundar-pichai-2025-ai-launches/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> revealed. In the email sent to employees, the Google CEO cited the "amazing" progress of future AI features currently in development.</p><p>"We ended 2024 on a super high note with Gemini 2.0, Willow, Veo 2, and lots of innovation across Search, YouTube, Cloud, Android, Pixel, and more," Pichai wrote. "The foundation to all of this is our technical and AI leadership, made possible by our full stack approach, and people were inspired by what we built."</p><p>By the full-stack approach, the Google chief executive is most likely referencing the company's development of AI features, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> models that enable them, and the Tensor smartphone processors that run them. Google is able to make efficient, tailor-made AI features by controlling the software, SoC, and AI models from top to bottom.</p><p>"As we start the year, I have been reviewing demos for the products and features we’re rolling out in the next few months," Pichai continued. "The progress is amazing, and I’m confident we will keep the momentum going in 2025."</p><p>Google already has a few work-in-progress features for 2025 that we know about, like Project Astra. That's t<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">he multimodal AI interface that we tried at Google I/O 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">opened up for waitlisted signups in December</a>. There's also the crop of Gemini 2.0 models, which are listed as "experimental" now but should fully release this year. Other projects, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>, could make an appearance.</p><p>There are surely projects that we don't know about, too. If Pichai's remarks are any indication, 2025 could be a good year for AI for Google.</p>

<ul><li>The Gemini app on Android is reportedly rolling out its new lock screen capabilities for calls and texts.</li><li>When enabled, the feature lets users command the AI via voice to call or text one of their stored contacts.</li><li>Google brought this feature into beta in December and, shortly after, the company started testing its new Flash 2.0 model.</li></ul>
<p>Google is pushing an update for Android users that makes its AI Gemini a little more useful.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/09/gemini-call-message-without-unlocking/#more-652193">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini app on Android is beginning to roll out its new calling and messaging capabilities via the lock screen. The publication notes that this update for the Gemini app affects the basic Google Assistant, too. The company has reportedly reduced the amount of available features the Assistant can offer users as Gemini picks up calling/messaging via the lock screen.</p><p>Google's more capable AI model's feature has supposedly "replaced" the Assistant's "lock screen settings" and "Assistant routines."</p><p>Additionally, as the feature arrives on more Android phones, it has been recommended that users enable the Phone app and Messages extensions via the Gemini app settings. Google details both extensions in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15575143?sjid=14948406395937871357-NA">a support page</a>, stating that, when enabled, users can "ask" Gemini to make a call or send a text when in the app.</p><p>However, with this function arriving for the lock screen, users only need to produce the AI's overlay and speak their command into their phone. It seems like users can follow the same basic written commands when using the hands-free voice capabilities. Essentially, users can say "Hey Google, call..." followed by the person's name.</p><p>This should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15574940">work similarly for messages</a> as saying "Hey Google, text/message..." is likely to get the job done.</p><p>The publication states the lock screen feature for Gemini's calling/messaging was spotted in version 15.50 of the Google app. So, if the feature hasn't yet appeared on your device, it's likely still making its rounds.</p>

<p>In December, Google first dropped its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-lock-screen-call-messages--rollout">Gemini on lock screen</a>" capabilities on Android tester. The beta showed that some users may see a new settings app within the Gemini app that details its lock screen functions. When activated, users can freely produce the AI without opening their phones. However, it was discovered that not every device will have this option available.</p><p>For devices without full support, Gemini will prompt users to unlock their devices so the call may be placed.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google continues to progress with its AI software by rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Flash 2.0 experiment</a> to Advanced subscribers. The test concerns those subscribers and the Gemini app on Android, letting them in on the new faster, lightweight model. The Flash 2.0 model takes things beyond what you'd find with Flash 1.5 or even the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Display was at CES 2025 and it showed off several screen concepts.</li><li>Among them, the company showed a "Slidable Flex Duet" and "Solo," which can slide out to the sides for a larger screen experience.</li><li>The company also showcased the world's first rollable OLED for laptops, which it states will arrive by June as it enters mass-production in April.</li><li>In CES 2024, Samsung Display showcased an in-and-out foldable phone and its rollable phone concept.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>CES 2025 is nearly over, but it was full of notable screen concepts from Samsung Display for multiple form factors.</p><p>Samsung Display released a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31326">press release</a> detailing its plans for CES 2025, highlighting several of its design concepts. Among them were a couple of concepts that could (potentially) be used for future phones or tablets. The first involves a Samsung Display concept called the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQ8hkci8o0">Slidable Flex Duet</a>." The company states this screen allows users to slide out from the left and right.</p><p>The post states that the display is roughly 8.1 inches when compact; however, fully sliding things out brings it up to 12.4 inches. There's also a "Solo" variant of this, which seemingly only lets users slide the screen out from one side. Per the post, this display starts at 13 inches before reaching 17.3 inches maximum.</p><p>Another concept seems befitting of a phone as Samsung Display dubs it the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFMFS0eoRhA">Slidable Flex Vertical</a>." This concept involves a user holding the device on either side at the top to pull upward. Samsung states that, at base, the device is 5.1 inches, but fully extending it brings it to 6.7 inches — the size of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.72%;"><img id="UA6Wy9rwNuoLeohCPUSU8b" name="samsung-display-slidable-flex-duet-example" alt="Samsung Display's "Slidable Flex Duet" lets users expand a screen from two sides, creating an even larger experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UA6Wy9rwNuoLeohCPUSU8b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="886" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Display)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During CES 2025, Samsung also showed off a rollable OLED concept for a Lenovo laptop. The concept involved a display that, when "rolled in," is a 14-inch screen that reportedly supports a 5:4 aspect ratio. Samsung states the display reaches 16.7 inches with an 8:9 aspect ratio when rolled out. Seeing as this is a laptop, the post — and the CES demo — states that the screen expands vertically.</p><p>The display was placed on the Lenovo ThinkPad Plus G6, a device that has to be released. However, today (Jan 9), Samsung Display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31332?category=67&page=1&type=list">announced</a> that it will begin mass-producing this rollable OLED laptop concept in April ahead of an official launch in June 2025.</p><p>Additionally, the company states it has applied its "Eco² OLED" technology to the upcoming ThinkPad, which "reduces panel thickness and power consumption."</p><p>In other news, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/i-just-saw-samsungs-stretchable-microled-display-at-ces-2025-and-its-totally-mind-boggling">Tom's Guide</a> spotted a stretchy Samsung Display concept that <em>literally</em> makes your content move off the screen. The publication states that the OEM calls this technology a "Stretchable MicroLED." As the name implies, the tech is relatively small, but will reportedly shift its form (like moving at you) depending on what is shown.</p><p>It's always interesting to see certain "proof of concepts" of sci-fi-like ideas, which is no different than what Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">showed during CES 2024</a>. Last year, the company was deep in its foldable phase as it showcased concepts for an in-and-out folding phone and a rollable display for a smartphone. Also, Samsung first showcased a "stretchable" display at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-demoes-stretchable-oled-display">Global Tech Korea in 2021</a>. The concept four years ago looked different than it does now, but the core functionality of morphing its shape for content remains the same.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Android Auto 13.5 update swaps "Car" for "Vehicle" in settings, hinting at broader vehicle support.</li><li>New icons in the interface, like one for Indian motorcycle brand TVS, suggest Google’s planning to bring Android Auto to bikes.</li><li>Android Auto is also prepping for a visual upgrade, with support for higher resolution displays coming soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be working on a few changes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, including bringing it to more vehicle types and giving it a fresh makeover for a smoother ride across all kinds of vehicles.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/07/android-auto-13-5-vehicle-support/#more-656369" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> recently spotted some subtle but telling tweaks in Android Auto version 13.5. Screenshots show that Google swapped out the word "Car" in the app’s settings for the more inclusive "Vehicle." While it might seem small, this change hints at a bigger plan: making Android Auto work across a wider range of rides, including motorcycles.</p>

<p>Currently, Android Auto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-vehicles">depends on your car model</a> or having a compatible aftermarket stereo. But according to 9to5Google's findings, that might be changing. It is speculated that Google could break free from these limits, with motorcycles possibly leading the charge.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-motorcycle-support-apk-3513842/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> also spotted new icons in the Android Auto interface that hint at motorcycle-specific features. One standout is an icon for TVS, an Indian motorcycle brand, suggesting Google is teaming up with manufacturers to bring Android Auto to bikes.</p><p>TVS' app icon shows up with other motor brands like China’s Geely and Leap Motor, California’s Lucid, and Italy’s Fiat. Interestingly, Fiat is the only one from that list officially compatible with Android Auto so far.</p><p>It also looks like Android Auto is gearing up for a visual upgrade. Code from the latest update hints at support for higher resolution displays, stepping beyond the current 1920x1080p limit.</p>

<p>This move could take full advantage of high-end vehicle screens, delivering a sharper and more polished experience to match modern infotainment systems.</p><p>Furthermore, Google seems to be making strides in bringing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> AI model to Android Auto. While it’s still early days for the backend integration, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-gemini-ui-3514032/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> spotted a visual clue—a Gemini-style gradient on the microphone icon.</p><p>When you tap the microphone icon (assuming it eventually becomes live), it kicks off an interaction with Gemini, showing the prompt "Ask Gemini" at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>These updates aren’t available in the current version of Android Auto yet, but they’re expected to roll out in future software updates.</p>

The X7 and X7 Pro are now available globally, and the latter model is particularly interesting, as POCO teamed up with Marvel to release an exclusive variant of the device, dubbed the POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. <br><br>I'm a big fan of these limited-edition models, and OnePlus used to do a terrific job rolling out unique designs in the past with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t-star-wars-review">OnePlus 5T Star Wars</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-6-avengers-edition">OnePlus 6 Avengers</a>, OnePlus 6T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7t-pro-mclaren-edition">7T Pro McLaren</a> models, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-2-pac-man-edition">Nord 2 Pac-Man</a> variant. It's exciting to see POCO get in on the action with the X7 Pro, and what's notable here is that the brand is doing so on a budget phone, making the device much more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ihzjJZu8huNrE2UAaSQTY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition packaging with SIM card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ihzjJZu8huNrE2UAaSQTY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, POCO isn't launching the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition in India, its biggest consumer market — the phone is instead debuting in select Asian countries. It is available in a single 12GB/512GB model, and costs $399. The base model of the X7 Pro, meanwhile, costs $299, with the 512GB model selling at $369, so you're basically paying $30 additionally for the Iron Man Edition.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's talk about the design. POCO clearly paid a lot of attention to small details, with the SIM card ejector in the box styled to look like an Arc Reactor.</p>

<p>The packaging itself is done really well, and it has a "mechanical lift structure" that's meant to mimic the feel of "donning Stark's armor," and you get a cutout highlighting blueprints of Iron Man's suit. There's a case included in the box that does a good job reinforcing the device while simultaneously showing off that design at the back.</p>

<p>Coming to the phone itself, the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition has a distinctive back design with red and gold hues, with the Iron Man helmet prominently highlighted. The helmet is housed within a stylized Arc Reactor, and the rest of the back has a "3D relief enhanced with platinum detailing" that does a great job accentuating the design.</p>

<p>POCO used a tiered system to create a sense of dimension to the design at the back, and the effect is rather interesting. "Thanks to the sophisticated layout of the tiered platinum serrations inside, the shining finish has been perfected for an even brighter, more sparkling look, creating a sense of dimensionality that mirrors the detailed craftsmanship of Stark's engineering. While using a combination of matte and gloss finishes with a sparkling sand texture, the helmet reflects a subtle brilliance under light, while the Arc Reactor's intricate patterns appear both powerful and precise."</p>

<p>While my immediate reaction after taking the device out of the box was that it looked a little tacky, I don't feel the same after using the phone for a week. POCO did a great job with the overall aesthetic of the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition, and the red accents around the cameras at the back and the power button distinguish the design quite a bit. You also get the Avengers logo at the bottom with the POCO logo located at the top, and both of these are decked out in gold, adding a nice bit of contrast.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY" name="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition" alt="POCO X7 Pro Iron Man Edition side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LRsen3ZbCKHuTvAq74kgVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides have a boxier design, but there are subtle curves, and I didn't see any issues with usability. That's mostly down to the matte texture on the sides, which just makes it easier to hold and use the device. Other niceties include custom backgrounds and an icon pack that has red borders, which is preinstalled. While I like the backgrounds, the icon pack is too distracting, and thankfully, you can easily switch it out.</p>

<p>The rest of the hardware is identical to the X7 Pro. You get a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh and 1920Hz DC dimming, and it is backed by Corning's Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>

<p>The phone is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 8400 Ultra, and you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The phone doesn't run demanding games at the highest setting, but it is decent enough in its category, and I didn't see many issues in this area. I'll go into much more detail in my review, but as a teaser, I'm including synthetic testing scores above.</p>

<p>Coming to the cameras, there's a 50MP Sony IMX882 that serves as the main shooter, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle, with POCO sensibly choosing to limit the device to two good sensors. There's a 6000mAh battery with 90W charging, and interestingly enough, the Indian model of the X7 Pro gets a bigger 6500mAh battery. The Iron Man Edition is based on the global variant, so it has a 6000mAh battery. Rounding out the hardware, you get IP68 ingress protection, NFC, IR blaster, and a decent vibration motor.</p>

<p>On the software side of things, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, which gives it a distinct edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>, a device that costs $150 more.</p><p>Overall, I really like what POCO did with the X7 Pro Iron Man Edition. The brand put a lot of thought into the design of the phone as well as the packaging, and it doesn't have an absurd premium over the standard X7 Pro. I would have liked to see the device in India, but outside of that, I don't really have anything to fault with the device — it is one of the best limited-edition models I used recently.</p>
