                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest PSVR 2 headset firmware update enables a direct PC connection via the built-in USB-C cable for supported PCs.</li><li>Sony hasn't released a software driver yet, which means official support isn't quite ready.</li><li>The headset requires a unique 12V connection, meaning most PC users will need some kind of adapter.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony regularly updates the PS5 and all its accessories, including headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a>. The latest firmware update includes a nifty hidden feature that will soon unlock direct PCVR usage when plugging a PSVR 2 into a supported PC, but there&apos;s a catch: you&apos;ll need a 12V USB-C port for it to work.</p><p>Sony&apos;s PSVR 2 hardware is designed similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualLink">Nvidia VirtualLink</a>, a special VR-ready port used on the company&apos;s GeForce RTX 2000 series of graphics cards. Nvidia no longer outfits cards with this special port in the 3000 and 4000 generation, meaning only users with a GeForce RTX 2000 series card and a VirtualLink port can directly connect a PSVR 2 and use it as a PC headset.</p><p>While this portion of the equation has been known for some time — you could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/992490/iVRy_Driver_for_SteamVR/">iVRy software</a> on Steam for PSVR PC usage — the new firmware update makes it so PCs will no longer require some kind of workaround software solution to make the headset work.</p><p>Now, all we&apos;re waiting on is an official Windows driver, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/iVRy_VR/status/1770724715444809964?s=20">iVRy on X</a> (formerly Twitter). Once Sony has that driver ready for consumers, a PSVR 2 headset should be usable as a PCVR headset without any hacky workarounds.</p><p>The final part of the equation, of course, is how to get around that VirtualLink port requirement. It&apos;s surmised that Sony is developing an adapter similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-get-psvr-adapter-ps5">PSVR to PS5 adapter</a> that&apos;ll allow users to plug a PSVR 2 into it and then into a PC for easy wired PCVR use. Sony has become increasingly friendly about providing its games on Steam in recent years, so it&apos;s entirely likely that we&apos;ll see a final official solution soon.</p>

The Zyber Elite Strap, one of our favorite accessories for folks looking to replace the included Meta strap, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHPDYLW1"><strong>currently sitting with a massive 36% discount</strong></a> during Amazon&apos;s Big Spring Sale, no strings attached. As if that wasn&apos;t enough, you can also clip a 20% coupon to be applied during checkout for even more savings. </p>

<p>As part of its major Spring Sale event, Amazon is quietly dropping 36% off the Zyber Elite Strap, a versatile and highly-adjustable strap that can totally eliminate neck and head discomfort during those longer VR gaming sessions. </p>
<p>It doesn't come with a battery pack, but if you don't need to extend the 2-ish hours of battery life on your Meta Quest 3, this Zyber strap is a wise choice. Pick one up now and you can even grab an additional 20% off coupon (just don't miss the little checkbox on the product page). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHPDYLW1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="48fc7702-fa6b-4655-8f5c-901772bd3047" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Zyber Elite Strap replacement: $38.99" data-dimension48="Zyber Elite Strap replacement: $38.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Zyber Elite Strap is one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>, not because it&apos;s particularly high-tech, but because it does what it&apos;s trying to do particularly well. This replacement head strap doesn&apos;t come with a battery pack like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-is-the-one-quest-3-accessory-you-actually-need">BoboVR M3 Pro</a>, but it adds a considerable amount of comfort for long gameplay sessions. The cloth strap that ships with the Meta Quest 3 is good enough for some people, but the Zyber Strap has multiple adjustment points for a fine-tuned fit, with a double-hinge system and downward tilt that takes some of the pressure off your head. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is one of the best VR headsets ever made, so why shouldn&apos;t it have a better head strap? The Prime Day-esque Amazon Big Spring Sale ends on Monday, March 25th, so don&apos;t wait too long if this discount piques your interest.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new Meta AI feature, SceneScript, can automatically map rooms and identify features such as walls, doors, windows, tables, and more.</li><li>The AI was trained on hundreds of thousands of procedurally generated rooms and could end manual room mapping on XR headsets.</li><li>Room data can also be used by LLMs to ask complex questions about living spaces for consumers and businesses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta researchers have debuted a new room scanning feature called SceneScript, which uses the power of AI to automatically identify a room&apos;s objects and architecture. While that sounds pretty scary, Meta is using it to improve AR and VR devices and make them more consumer-friendly.</p><p>A detailed post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@edwardrichardmiller/post/C4yJmsagJO2">Threads</a> juxtaposes current room mapping techniques with the new model, showcasing how much easier VR and AR usage is with the new model. Meta debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-to-set-up-your-room-for-meta-quest-pro-mixed-reality">manual room mapping</a> on the Quest Pro, while the depth sensor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> can automatically map floors, walls, and ceilings. The problem is that you still have to manually map couches, tables, windows, and other room features.</p><p>This new technique would use the depth sensor, along with cameras, to make a complete map of the room, including automatically mapped furniture and other architectural features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gC5v3wHqPkBzZyD64P3yrG" name="meta-project-aria-ai-room-mapping.gif" alt="Meta's Project Aria AI mapping a room automatically" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gC5v3wHqPkBzZyD64P3yrG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The automatic room mapping technique on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a> means users don&apos;t have to manually map anything at all. Still, Apple&apos;s headset doesn&apos;t automatically identify objects with names and features, just as blank surfaces with which virtual objects can interact.</p><p>Meta&apos;s more advanced mapping feature means that this data can be fed into an LLM like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-working-on-open-source-artificial-general-intelligence">Meta LLaMA</a>, which can then be asked questions about the room. One research example, "how many pots of paint would it take to paint this room?" helps illustrate the value of such data for future AR glasses, in particular.</p><p>Meta used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/">Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset</a> — a collection of 100,000 virtual procedurally-generated rooms — to train the AI so it can understand how rooms are laid out and how to properly identify objects. This helps it understand all sorts of different layouts and decor types, as well as variations in furniture and how a room can still be mapped even if things are moved around.</p><p>Meta hasn&apos;t revealed whether or not this will be coming to the Meta Quest 3, but it&apos;s entirely possible that such an upgrade could be included in one of the regular monthly software updates. It&apos;s entirely possible we could see such a feature in the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">Meta Quest UI overhaul</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung plans to offer a whopping eight years of OS upgrades for enterprise versions of the Galaxy Tab Active 5. </li><li>An executive for Samsung shared the move on LinkedIn, which will see the Galaxy Tab Active 5 get updates through 2032.</li><li>The Galaxy Tab Active 5 was released earlier this year, and the standard version will only get five years of software support. Enterprise users will have three years of additional support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-active-5-debut">Galaxy Tab Active 5</a> earlier this year as a rugged tablet aimed to assist frontline workers. There are standard and enterprise versions of the tablet, though usually, there aren&apos;t many differences between the business and consumer models. However, this year, the enterprise edition of the Galaxy Tab Active 5 is confirmed to be getting three additional years of software support compared to the standard version. While the regular Galaxy Tab Active 5 will get five years of full OS upgrades, the enterprise version will get eight. </p><p>Andy Rottiers, an executive for Samsung Electronics, announced the company&apos;s plans in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyrottiers_itmanagers-samsung-securitypatches-activity-7176493307638763520-_fOP/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn. "2024 started with some good news for IT managers needing to service a large fleet of devices for a longer period," Rottiers wrote. "Samsung is introducing extended security patches and OS updates for their newly launched devices."</p><p>Rottiers confirmed that the enterprise Galaxy Tab Active 5 EE will be supported for eight years, meaning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-tablet">rugged tablet</a> will get OS upgrades through 2032. Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy S24 EE and Galaxy XCover7 EE will each be supported for a seven-year window. These plans follow a trend by OEMs of pushing the boundaries of how long aging hardware can be supported. For example, both the Galaxy S24 series and the Google Pixel 8 lineup are promised to get seven years of full OS upgrades. </p>

<p>The long guarantee of software support makes sense for the enterprise market, where companies hope to deploy their technology for extended periods of time, usually spanning many years or even decades. Due to its rugged build, the Galaxy Tab Active 5 is specifically oriented at frontline workers. The tablet features Gorilla Glass 5, IP68 water and dust resistance, and a protective case that can withstand drops up to 1.8m.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached a point where Apple, Google, Samsung, and others are competing to provide the longest stretches of software support possible. However, we still don&apos;t know what software support for something like the Galaxy Tab Active 5 will look like in eight years. Who knows whether the hardware will hold up in 2032 or if Galaxy Tab Active 5 devices will even be in service at that time? Still, it&apos;s good news for consumers and businesses that devices are nearing a decade of support for full OS upgrades.</p>

<ul><li>This new update follows what had been announced last year by the company. </li><li>Users can take deeper control over their geolocation. </li><li>Apps can now be individually determined to have camera or microphone access. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new update coming to ChromeOS will allow users to have even more control over what apps can see their location. It’s all part of a larger security update coming to the platform, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/shields-up-powerful-new-security-features-in-chromeos">which was announced on Thursday by the tech giant</a>. Though, it’s important to note that many of the updates included within the announcement will affect mainly enterprise users, but the location and privacy settings will impact all. </p><p>Per the announcement, ChromeOS will provide users with enhanced privacy controls, including geolocation control and app-level permissions for camera, microphone and geolocation services. The goal is to enhance “user productivity and transparency with a single hub for all privacy controls,” according to the official blog update. </p><p>These new controls follow what the company had announced last year, which was the ability for users to toggle access to the camera and microphone at a system-based level. Through that update, users who had the toggle turned off would then be asked if they’d like to turn on the microphone or camera when a website attempts to gain access. </p><p>The geolocation control will allow users to individually determine which apps and services can access their geolocation. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/chromeos-location-toggle/">Per 9to5Google</a>, which first spotted the new update, the enhanced controls will disable Google Location Services and can be accessed in the Security and Privacy settings. </p>

<p>In its official blog, the company utilized Instagram as a case example of app-level permissions. In this example, a user could individually control the app and its access, including what permissions it has, such as the camera. Turning it on would allow the app to access a user&apos;s camera, and toggling it off would prevent the app from doing so altogether.</p><p>Additionally, if the user has the toggle on,  Instagram would only have access when the app is in use; otherwise, it would be blocked. This level of control would extend across multiple apps and allow users to do the same for the microphone, allowing users to take charge of how these features and apps interact with them.</p><p>In all, with this update, users can rest easy knowing that they have as much control as possible over what other companies can see and detect.</p>

Amazon has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ9R47PC">slashed 25% off the Google Pixel 7a</a> as a part of its Spring Sale, bringing the phone back down to its lowest price ever. The Pixel 7a was only previously discounted this much during Black Friday, offering an excellent price on an already great mid-level smartphone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> is one of our favorite Android phones, offering a bright 6.1-inch AMOLED display, a great set of cameras including a wide-angle lens, 128GB of storage, and the quick, smooth performance we&apos;ve come to expect from Pixel phones. While its battery life leaves something to be desired, it&apos;s still a better alternative than most of its direct competitors.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 7a is $125 off its normal purchase price for Amazon's Spring Sale, which is only set to last through March 25th. This capable smartphone was our pick for the best mid-range Android phone, and at this extra-low price, it's looking even more appealing.</p>
<p>With 128GB of storage, a beautiful 6.1-inch AMOLED screen, and solid photo- and video-taking capabilities, the Pixel 7a is definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a cheap smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a powerful phone camera with a wide-angle lens; you want something with strong performance without the high price tag; you&apos;re looking for a phone with a vibrant AMOLED display.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re buying a phone specifically for gaming; you prioritize battery life in a phone.</p><p>We consider the Google Pixel 7a the best mid-range phone available today, even earning fourth overall in our 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Best Android phones</a> index. The Pixel 7a has a strong set of cameras that offer a major upgrade from the Pixel 6a, including a wide-angle lens many users like. Additionally, it comes with 128GB of storage, a beautiful 6.1-inch AMOLED screen, IP67 water and dust resistance, and pretty impressive performance with its Google Tensor G2 processor.</p><p>As a mid-range phone, it doesn&apos;t have flawless gaming performance, though it&apos;s passable for most games. In our own tests of the phone, we also discovered that features like Face Unlock and Face Detection were killing the battery super fast, but turning these off kept us close to the full-day battery life mark.</p>

<ul><li>Predictive Back allows users to "preview" their destination when using the back gesture.</li><li>On Gmail, Predictive Back will preview the inbox when attempting to exit an email.</li><li>The feature is also reportedly available on Google Calendar </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 14 users can begin experimenting with Predictive Back on Gmail while they wait for the feature to be deployed system-wide. </p><p>As first spotted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/19/gmail-in-app-predictive-back/"> 9to5Google</a>, Gmail version 2024.03.03.x allows users to take advantage of the nifty gesture. As it stands, Predictive Back on a system level is behind developer options, and the tech giant has yet to implement it across all of Android 14. Still, it’s a welcomed sight for users who fancy productivity. </p><p>For the uninitiated, Predictive Back is a feature that allows a user to “preview” their destination when using the back gesture on their device. This feature gives a user a chance to decide whether they want to continue and commit to swiping back or returning to their current view. That current view is minimized while the user decides what action they’d like to take. </p><p>As Android’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/patterns/predictive-back"><u>developer website notes</u></a>, “predictive back provides a smoother, more intuitive navigation experience while using gesture navigation. It leverages built-in animations to inform users where their actions will take them to reduce unexpected outcomes.” </p><p>Users on Gmail will notice that when using the back gesture and through Predictive Back, their email will shrink into the corner, with the preview being the user’s inbox. As a result, the animation allows the user to commit to whether they’d like to exit the email and return it to their inbox. The Predictive Back feature is also apparently available in Google Calendar its monthly and daily overviews </p><p>It remains to be seen when Predictive Back as a whole will be implemented across Android 14 without the need for developer options. The tech giant has also encouraged developers to work towards enabling it within their own apps, even providing<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture"><u> an entire rundown of how to do so</u></a>.  </p>

The proof is in the pudding with these AMVR Quest 3 controller grips that are mainly designed to add grip and a hand strap, making it fast to change out the battery or use another Quest 3 controller accessory temporarily.</p><p>The secret is in the Quest 3 controller&apos;s ingenious battery door design which clips in and is only released with the press of a button. AMVR Quest 3 controller grips slot in place of the standard controller battery door, adding a lovely grippy texture and easily adjustable hand straps to make throwing objects in VR easier.</p><p>The hand straps are quickly adjustable via a velcro backing, and the ribbed texture on the grip surface helps keep hands cool even during long sweaty play sessions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>.</p>

<p>The original release of this controller grip was defective but AMVR quickly replaced those with a refined version that doesn&apos;t break easily. I&apos;ve been using them for months and have yet to find any structural issues, so I&apos;m confident that the original problems have been fixed.</p><p>My favorite part about these grips is how simple it is to remove them when necessary. You won&apos;t be changing out batteries very often since the Quest 3 controller battery life lasts weeks on end, but I often play Walkabout Mini Golf with friends and love putter accessories like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/helloreal-quest-golf-putter">HelloReal Putter</a> or this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Attachment-Compatible-Accessories-Controller/dp/B0CP1MH1J6/">AMVR Quest 3 golf club</a>.</p><p>Both require you to remove the grips to fit snugly inside the club attachment, and it&apos;s nice to just pop the grips off with a single button press and slide the controllers into the golf club.</p>

<p>AMVR also sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Protector/dp/B0CJF9QKZ5/">another controller grip</a> that completely covers the controller, if you prefer that. These are also good and add a similar hand strap to make throwing easier, but require more work to take off in case you want to use other accessories.</p><p>For me, though, simple is best. That&apos;s why I prefer the regular AMVR Quest 3 controller grips and why I call them one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. Of all the ones I&apos;ve tested so far, this is my favorite way to play.</p>

<p>For years, the Garmin Forerunner 245 was Android Central&apos;s #1 pick thanks to its reliable health and location tracking, along with tools like Garmin Coach that keep you on the right training path. Then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> took its place with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-vs-245">key upgrades</a> like heart rate variability, all-systems multi-band GNSS, and new widgets like a Morning Report and Race Widget that made training planning easier.</p><p>I bring up these watches first because the Garmin Forerunner 265, our pick for the best runners watch, is only a "prettier 255," as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">my review</a> described it.</p><p>You&apos;re getting the same experience for $100 extra, in terms of analyzing your form, performance, and heart health to help recommend your future workouts and recovery times. Both are fantastic devices, and when you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-vs-255">Forerunner 265 vs. 255</a>, the latter has 95% of the same tools.</p><p>So why do I recommend the Forerunner 265? Because the 416 x 416 AMOLED display is significantly more readable than the memory-in-pixel (MIP) displays on most running watches. The 265 is beautifully bright and ensures using your watch indoors isn&apos;t an eye-straining chore. It also lowers the battery life compared to bulkier Forerunners, but 20–24 GPS hours is still above average.</p><p>We also appreciate its one exclusive upgrade over the 255: Training Readiness. An update to the Body Battery stat, it uses HRV status, sleep data, and acute load to measure your muscles&apos; recovery time in addition to your body&apos;s overall energy. So you&apos;ll never be told to run when your body is sore, just because you slept well.</p><p>Ultimately, this is one of the most comprehensive watches for self-guided runners to improve their PRs and VO2 Max scores. The Forerunner 965 is better, but the 265 has a slightly more reasonable price and has all the core tools most runners need.</p>

<p>Shopping for the best running watch doesn&apos;t automatically mean you need to spend a fortune. The Amazfit Cheetah Pro comes with core features like built-in GPS, heart-rate monitoring, activity/sleep tracking, sports apps, energy monitoring, and stress tracking. It trades off features like NFC, but it has all the essentials for a much lower price than most running smartwatches.</p><p>As our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Cheetah Pro review</a> explained, the lightweight Amazfit smartwatch packs plenty of value for money. You get extremely accurate GPS tracking, Alexa onboard, the ability to answer calls on your wrist thanks to the mic and speakers, as well as local music storage. The wearable can last for around two weeks on a single charge, so the battery life is excellent.</p><p>Apart from all the necessary health and fitness tracking sensors, the Amazfit Cheetah Pro also comes with the brand&apos;s proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-amazfit-zepp-coach">AI Zepp Coach</a>. Just like any decent Garmin watch, it uses AI to create a recovery plan and helps you understand how much rest time you need between workouts.</p><p>If you want to go even cheaper, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-round-vs-cheetah-pro">Amazfit Cheetah Round</a> is a stripped-down version of the Cheetah Pro with almost the same features. It&apos;s a decent cheap alternative to consider.</p>

<p>Most people are happy enough with a watch that lasts one day under normal circumstances, while last-gen running watches often only lasted 10-20 hours with GPS tracking enabled, or relied on solar panels to last longer. The COROS APEX 2 can last a whopping 45 hours per charge, ensuring it&apos;ll never die on you even if you start a workout with low battery levels.</p><p>COROS is a popular brand among many runners, and in recent years it has developed significant software tools like an EvoLab for measuring training effect and recovery time and a Training Hub for getting training plans to improve your times. If you&apos;re only familiar with Garmin watches, you shouldn&apos;t sleep on the APEX 2, which gives the Forerunner 265 a run for its money (no pun intended).</p><p>It has a titanium frame and sapphire glass, giving the APEX 2 a more premium appearance than most plastic-heavy running watches (like most Garmin watches). Otherwise, I appreciated that it has both a touchscreen and digital crown for whichever type of navigation you prefer, though some runners will prefer Garmin&apos;s specific Up and Down buttons to a dial.</p><p>The APEX 2 has blood oxygen and ECG detection — though you can only spot-check this information rather than run it continuously. And it uses all-systems GNSS tracking, meaning it relies upon multiple satellite systems at once to detect your positioning more exactly, in case your signal is blocked from a specific direction.</p><p>Technically, the better option for battery life is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">COROS APEX 2 Pro</a>, which lasts a whopping 75 hours per charge and offers other "pro" upgrades like increased storage and dual-frequency GPS tracking. But we recommended the APEX 2 over the Pro in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">review</a>, noting that it&apos;s a better deal for its lower price point. COROS lowered the APEX 2&apos;s price after launch, making it $100 less than the Forerunner 265 at full price. </p>

<p>When we first reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Garmin Forerunner 955</a>, we called it the "best runner&apos;s watch, period." Since then, the Forerunner 265 and 965 have complicated the discussion. I&apos;m currently reviewing the Forerunner 965, which (like the 265) is a more expensive 955 with an AMOLED facelift. Keep that in mind when you&apos;re making your choice; but until that review goes live, the 955 is still my recommendation.</p><p>The Forerunner 955 is a bigger but more polished version of our former top pick, the Forerunner 255. Its bulky design comes partially from its impressive battery (42 GPS hours is nearly unmatched, aside from the COROS APEX 2 Pro) and a 1.4-inch MIP display. </p><p>I especially loved its Training Readiness perk during my review period, but now Garmin is bringing the tool to other Forerunner and Instinct watches. Still, the Forerunner 955 has other exclusive features, starting with a real-time stamina bar that shows your estimated energy left so you don&apos;t overtrain. It also tells you how quickly you&apos;re acclimating to high heat or altitude, taking that data into account for workout suggestions.</p><p>It has a whopping 32GB of storage for both music and maps — including preloaded topographical maps, golf and skiing maps, and room for uploaded GPX maps, which more adventurous runners will find incredibly useful. You can see Strava Live Segments on your wrist during a run, or if you choose a route in advance, the Climbpro feature will preview what kind of elevation gain to expect moving forward. </p>

<p>Most of the best running watches put much more stock in running coaching and health data than traditional "smartwatch" features that require a battery-guzzling processor. But some runners really don&apos;t want to compromise on smarts and will accept a shorter battery for better functionality. In that case, pay close attention to the Samsung Galaxy Watch series.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic</a> sport an Exynos W930 chipset with 2GB of RAM for silky-smooth performance and app support that most other runners&apos; watches can&apos;t offer. That includes Wear OS apps like Strava, Adidas Running, Nike Run Club, and so on; you can directly access these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> instead of having to export data to them from apps like Garmin Connect.</p><p>Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic watches have a gorgeous super AMOLED display with a touch bezel for scrolling through menus, with a physical rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. And they all share a bevy of health sensors that measure everything from your heart&apos;s health and rhythm to your overall body composition (aka fat and muscle percentage) and blood oxygen.</p><p>You get the same all-day battery life on both Watch 6 series devices as their battery specs are the same. Where other Wear OS watches and the Apple Watch could die after just a few hours of GPS tracking, the Galaxy Watch 6 is much more dependable to handle that, continuous HRM, music storage, and so on without instantly dying. Unfortunately, the tradeoff for this battery life is that it&apos;s hard to get past just how heavy this watch is as a runner used to lighter devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> we&apos;ve tested, giving you plenty of perks <em>outside</em> of fitness to enjoy, while still giving plenty of perks for casual runners striving to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Some people run for the joy of running; others because it&apos;s the simplest way to get your heart and body healthier. If health is your main concern, or if you spend as much time in the gym as hitting the pavement, you may want to opt for a Fitbit instead. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Fitbit Versa 4</a> is the more affordable watch, or you could switch to a tracker like the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-charge-5-review">Charge 5</a> instead. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit</a> for health tracking is the flagship Fitbit Sense 2.</p><p>The Sense 2 comes with one of the widest ranges of health sensors available, tracking your heart rate, rhythm, and variance, blood oxygen, and skin temperature. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a>, you&apos;ll get various reports on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-fitbit-daily-readiness-score-and-how-do-i-use-it">Daily Readiness</a>, overall health, stress levels, health trends over the last 90 days, possible issues like fevers or AFib, and other useful tools and scores.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2 review</a> explains the many perks that come with this model, starting with the attractive "squircle" design with AMOLED touchscreen and the new side button that replaces the finicky capacitive button of the original Sense. Its reliance on a touchscreen makes it less reliable than button navigation when your fingertips get sweaty, but it&apos;s undoubtedly a lighter, more attractive watch for casual wear outside of runs. And you&apos;ll get good everyday mileage out of tools like tap-to-pay, Amazon Alexa integration, and even Google Maps support.</p><p>In terms of fitness features, you get essentials like heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, automatic exercise recognition, on-screen workouts, and female health tracking. And you&apos;ll love Active Zone Minutes, which shows the time you spend in fat burn, cardio, or break heart-rate zones.</p><p>You don&apos;t get any super-advanced features here as far as running is concerned, and the six-day battery life doesn&apos;t match other options on this list. Plus, it only has 5 hours of estimated GPS tracking, well below the other options on this list — plenty for casual runners who won&apos;t run longer than an hour or so, but not enough for all-day tracking.</p>

<p>When shopping for the best running watch, there are several factors to consider, including your battery life needs, feature preferences, and budget. Most dedicated runners will find the Garmin Forerunner 265 to be their best option, whether you prioritize price and battery life or display quality and the latest software. Regardless, Garmin watches give you great running guidance at no extra charge.</p><p>Before you choose your running watch, make sure that you&apos;re committed to using that software to amp up your running performance and endurance. Otherwise, you may just want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">traditional smartwatch</a> until you&apos;re sure you are committed. A Galaxy Watch gives you the essentials, and lets you export data to popular third-party <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">running apps</a> where you can get useful maps and analysis. </p><p>Not everyone needs a watch that lasts for weeks, since it could mean missing out on smarter tools or more attractive designs. But if you want something on the other end of the spectrum, anything from a COROS to a Fitbit could give you the health and fitness focus that you want.</p>

<p>The Google engineering team was frank about the experiment&apos;s successes and shortcomings. In ideal situations, the villagers came to the right conclusion nine times out of 10; without proper reasoning and memory, the results fell to three out of 10. The bots were too cagey to reveal useful information and too skeptical of any claims, leading to random dogpiling on unlucky targets.</p><p>Even at full mental capacity, though, these bots tended to be too skeptical of anyone (like seers) who made bold claims early on. They tracked the bots&apos; intended end-of-round votes after each line of dialogue and found that their opinions rarely changed after those initial suspicions, regardless of what was said. </p><p>Google&apos;s human testers, despite saying it was a blast to play Werewolf with AI bots, rated them 2/5 or 3/5 for reasoning and found that the best strategy for winning was to stay silent and let certain bots take the fall.</p><p>As Friedhoff explained, it&apos;s a legitimate strategy for a werewolf but not necessarily a fun one or the point of the game. The players had more fun messing with the bots&apos; personalities; in one example, they told the bots to talk like pirates for the rest of the game, and the bots obliged — while also getting suspicious, asking, "Why ye be doing such a thing?"</p>

<p>That aside, the test showed the limits of the bots&apos; reasoning. They would give bots personalities — like a paranoid bot suspicious of everyone or a theatrical bot that spoke like a Shakespearean actor — and other bots reacted to those personalities without any context. They found the theatrical bot suspicious for how wordy and roundabout it was, even though that&apos;s its default personality.</p><p>In real-life Werewolf, the goal is to catch people speaking or behaving <em>differently than usual</em>. That&apos;s where these LLMs fall short. </p><p>Friedhoff also provided a hilarious example of a bot hallucination leading the villagers astray. When Isaac (the seer bot) accused Scott (the werewolf bot) of being suspicious, Scott responded that Isaac had accused the innocent "Liam" of being a werewolf and gotten him unfairly exiled. Isaac responded defensively, and suspicion turned to him — even though Liam didn&apos;t exist and the scenario was made up. </p>

<p>Google&apos;s AI efforts, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, have become smarter over time. Another GDC panel showcased Google&apos;s vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gcd-2024-google-pushes-devs-toward-genai-living-games">generative AI video games</a> that auto-respond to player feedback in real-time and have "hundreds of thousands" of LLM-backed NPCs that remember player interactions and respond organically to their questions. </p><p>Experiments like this, though, look past Google execs&apos; bold plans and show how far artificial intelligence has to go before it&apos;s ready to replace actual written dialogue or real-life players. </p><p>Chen and Friedhoff managed to imitate the complexity of dialogue, memory, and reasoning that goes into a party game like Werewolf, and that&apos;s genuinely impressive! But these LLM bots need to go back to school before they&apos;re consumer-ready. </p><p>In the meantime, Friedhoff says that these kinds of LLM experiments are a great way for game developers to "contribute to machine learning research through games" and that their experiment shows that players are more excited by <em>building</em> and teaching LLM personalities than they are about playing with them. </p><p>Eventually, the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">mobile games</a> with text-based characters that respond organically to your text responses is intriguing, especially for interactive fiction, which typically requires hundreds of thousands of words of dialogue to give players enough choices. </p><p>If the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> with NPUs capable of AI processing could deliver speedy LLM responses for organic games, that could be truly transformative for gaming. This Generative Werewolf experiment is a good reminder that this future is a ways off, however.</p>
