<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Gemini app for Android might soon add a handy feature that will let you read responses as they&apos;re generated rather than waiting for the whole thing.</p><p>According to code sleuth AssembleDebug, who tipped off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/22/gemini-assistant-real-time-responses/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>, Google might be adding a "real-time responses" feature to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app. As the name suggests, it&apos;ll whip up answers to your questions on the spot.</p><p>Currently, when you shoot off your question to Gemini, it analyzes it and then churns out an answer, but you&apos;re stuck twiddling your thumbs until the whole thing is done. It can drag on, especially if the responses are lengthy paragraphs.</p><p>But with the real-time response feature, you&apos;d see Gemini&apos;s response building piece by piece, just like on the web version. Google sums it up nicely: "Responses will show in real-time while in progress."</p><p>Web users already see a cool typing animation as Gemini crafts your answer. If this new find gets rolled out to everyone, you&apos;ll see that same animation jazzing up the Gemini app on Android.</p><p>AssembleDebug managed to switch on the toggle for the feature in Gemini&apos;s settings menu, hinting that it&apos;s just about ready to drop into a stable release, if at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:479px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:156.58%;"><img id="N6cuY4rAoSwUmFxRUTyrVG" name="google-gemini-real-time-response-settings.jpg" alt="Google Gemini real-time response on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6cuY4rAoSwUmFxRUTyrVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="479" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / PiunikaWeb)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This improvement would definitely be handy, shaving off a few precious seconds by letting you dive into reading right away. It&apos;s especially helpful if you&apos;re only interested in the first few lines or paragraphs of a long response.</p><p>While digging around, AssembleDebug uncovered more than just real-time responses for Gemini. The tipster stumbled upon a new toggle called "Use location from your device" on the same settings page. As it implies, this feature would let users manage Gemini&apos;s access to their location.</p><p>Adding to the mix, PiunikaWeb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-assistant-app-testing-music-streaming-setting">recently reported</a> that Gemini might incorporate your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">favorite music streaming service</a>. It&apos;s a significant development, especially since Gemini is missing out on a few features compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and this could help bridge the gap.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google released the Android 15 Beta 1.1 update with several bug fixes.</li><li>One fix addresses the NFC bug that rendered the feature useless, making contactless payments via Google Wallet unavailable.</li><li>The update is rolling out now on eligible Pixel smartphones, and those that had issues updating to the beta should now be able to.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 Beta</a> was launched a couple of weeks ago, bringing the platform closer to stability than the more developer-focused preview builds. However, the beta brought a nasty bug that effectively disabled NFC operations on many Pixel phones. Now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cahsd1/android_15_beta_11_patch_now_available/">the latest Android 15 Beta</a>, Google is fixing NFC on Pixels.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 1.1 (<strong>AP31.240322.023</strong>) is rolling out now on eligible Pixel phones, and it brings with it several bug fixes, including a text-clipping issue and a problem with Developer Options. However, one of the more pressing bugs for Pixel owners who opted into the beta is one that effectively disabled NFC. The settings menu for NFC was essentially blank, even as Google introduced the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-default-wallet-option">choose your default Wallet app</a> more easily via the Default apps settings page.</p><p>I previously tried to make a payment at the store when my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> was on the first beta, but I was only met with an odd error on the payment terminal. Fortunately, I had my physical card on me at the time, but that&apos;s not always the case.</p><p>Now, the page is back, and full NFC functionality appears to be working, too. Just to make sure, I went back to the store after installing the latest Android 15 beta, and the payment went through as it normally would.</p>

<p>Aside from fixing NFC, the update also addresses an issue that prevented some users from installing the beta in the first place. Hopefully, anyone hoping to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a> will be able to do so now.</p><p>Here is the full changelog for the new 1.1 patch, per Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed various issues with NFC that interfered with wallet apps and other NFC-dependent system operations.

<p>If you&apos;re interested in installing the beta, you&apos;ll need at least a Pixel 6 (or newer), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. Keep in mind that it will likely still be filled with bugs as Google irons out the kinks ahead of the scheduled platform stability, which is expected in June.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet might start asking for a PIN on Wear OS watches, potentially making payments less convenient.</li><li>Some Reddit users report having to input a PIN for every payment attempt on their Wear OS watches.</li><li>The PIN prompt seems limited to a few users, suggesting it could be a test, a glitch, or a gradual rollout by Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paying with your Wear OS watch with Google Wallet might get annoying soon, as the app might start asking for a PIN before you can use the speedy payment feature.</p><p>Google Wallet taps into your Android phone and NFC to make payments super easy. It even jumped onto your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">beloved Wear OS watches</a>, so you could pay straight from your wrist. But here comes a security update that might make paying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS</a> a tad more irritating.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1c8iqw7/gpay_now_needs_to_input_pin_everytime_you_make/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> are reporting about Google Wallet making them enter a PIN every single time they try to pay with their watch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/20/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-pay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This is different from before, where just a tap did the trick. Unless your device figures out it&apos;s far enough from your body, it&apos;s not going to bug you for a PIN.</p><p>Wear OS smartwatches already make you set up a PIN for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> security, so this new pop-up for every tap seems like a bit much, especially on those tiny screens.</p><p>Since it seems like only a few users are getting hit with this new prompt, there are a couple of things that might be going down, as noted by 9to5. Maybe Google is testing out this feature on a select few watches. Or, it could be a glitch in the app. Or, Google might be slowly introducing the PIN requirement to everyone, one watch at a time.</p><p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">made phone users re-verify their Wallet information</a> after a few minutes. So, it&apos;s possible the company is doing something similar for Wear OS, which definitely removes the convenience you get with those speedy wrist taps.</p><p>However, the updated Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519" target="_blank">support page</a> doesn&apos;t even mention smartwatches, hinting that this new authentication requirement might not be on purpose.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s important to remember that this could be a security improvement Google is testing (even if it is a bit annoying), assuming this new feature is indeed heading to smartwatches.</p>

For a limited time, you can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-128gb-unlocked-ink-blue/6540584.p"><strong>up to $200 off on the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) from Best Buy</strong></a> when you have the retailer activate the phone to the carrier of your choice. Even if you connect it to your carrier later, you&apos;ll still get $100 off the price, which is already a 40% discount.</p><p>While the Moto G 5G is really nothing special, it&apos;s a great pick at this price for anyone in need of a cheap, basic smartphone. It boasts decent camera functionality, pretty good stereo speakers, slick Motorola gestures, and over a day&apos;s worth of battery life.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2023-review">Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)</a> normally comes in at a cheap sticker price, but this discount makes it even cheaper, dropping as low as $49.99 if you activate today. With its aesthetically pleasing design, decent cameras, and more than a full day of battery life, this deal is a no-brainer for those who want a no-frills smartphone.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this phone charges fairly slowly, and it doesn't include NFC. Still, dealing with some of its shortcomings might be easier at this extra-low price.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-128GB-MPCamera-163-94x74-98x8-39/dp/B0C2SWQBMB">Amazon - $149.99</a> | <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-5g-gen-2/p?skuId=894">Motorola - $149.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-128gb-unlocked-ink-blue/6540584.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a3070159-46d4-4fdb-adf9-23b269d8594a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>smartphone price point is a major selling point for you; you&apos;ve owned past Motorola phones and enjoyed them.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone with NFC capabilities; you&apos;re willing to spend a few hundred dollars more for a phone with more bells and whistles; slow charging speeds are a deterrent for you.</p><p>The Motorola Moto 5G has all the basics you would expect to find in a smartphone, despite being the 2023 version. Besides lacking NFC capabilities, having limited software updates, and taking quite a while to charge, the Moto 5G still offers excellent speakers, more than a day of battery per charge, and a decent camera.</p><p>While this phone didn&apos;t land a spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list, the Moto G is super affordable and is a solid pick for anyone trying to get a phone at the lowest sticker price possible. Especially with the additional $100 or $200 off, it&apos;s not hard to justify some of the quirky design choices included with this smartphone.</p>

<p>Ozaif writes:</p><p><em><strong>I recently bought a Redmi Note 12 5G and I have gyroscope and accelerometer issues in games and other things. Is there a solution?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>This question from Ozaif is very similar to others we&apos;ve received, where something is happening that causes a new(ish) phone to not perform the way we think it should. It&apos;s a thing that can happen to any phone or electronic device, and it&apos;s a wonder that it doesn&apos;t happen more often.</p><p>For starters, don&apos;t get frustrated. At the risk of sounding like an apologist for any phone maker, when you manufacture and sell millions of products, some are going to have hardware faults. There&apos;s no way to test everything on every phone without driving the price even higher than it already is.</p>
<p>The good news is that companies usually resolve these issues quickly. You just need to know where to start. You might think you should contact the company that made your phone but that&apos;s not always the case.</p>
<h2 id="who-did-you-buy-it-from-2">Who did you buy it from?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:881px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG" name="best-buy-sign.jpg" alt="Best Buy store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="881" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Best Buy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can buy a new phone directly from the manufacturer, but it&apos;s also really common to buy through a third party. This could be from a carrier like AT&T or Orange, a retail partner like Best Buy or Walmart, or an online retailer like Amazon.</p><p>Where you bought your phone could make a difference here. For starters, different sales channels have different types of warranty. We all know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Applecare and Samsung Care Plus</a>, but you&apos;re also able to buy extra protection from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/protect-amazon-tech-purchases-asurions-home-protection-plans">Asurion</a>. You might have seen this option when you bought a phone online or heard about it from a salesperson.</p>
<p>The warranty — which every phone has unless you&apos;re buying it in a country it wasn&apos;t intended to be sold in — is the first course of action if your phone is acting up. If you&apos;re unsure about who to contact for a warranty claim or if your warranty is still in effect, ask the place where you bought your phone, and they will help; they want you to be happy enough to buy your next phone from them, after all.</p><p>A special note here for people in North America who bought a phone through a carrier: you need to initiate any service or warranty claims through them because they&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">special type of partner</a>. </p><p>A phone made by Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-att-phones">specifically for AT&T</a> (for example) is essentially an AT&T product. It was built by Samsung, and in the end, Samsung may be the one who fixes things, but it&apos;s still an AT&T product. Carrier phones in the U.S. and Canada are weird like that. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2033px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g" name="ATT-logo-building.jpg" alt="AT&T Store in NYC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2033" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re out of warranty and have no extended service contract, you have limited options. Some things, like a stuck button or malfunctioning camera, are fixable, but others — like a broken gyroscope — aren&apos;t. There&apos;s no way to isolate, decouple, and replace components like this that isn&apos;t going to cost less than buying a new phone.</p><p>Make sure you have an actual hardware issue. Something that happens in some apps but not in others is indicative of incompatible software and not "broken" hardware, so do a bit of sleuthing yourself and see if you can consistently cause the problem. One option is to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-run-diagnostics-on-your-pixel">diagnostic tool</a>, like the one found on Pixel phones.</p>
<p>If you can, try asking a local phone repair center to take a look at it and diagnose the issue. This might cost a few dollars, and you might not like what they find, but it&apos;s better than sending your phone off somewhere and being without it for a week or two.</p><p>It also gives you an idea of what&apos;s wrong, whether it&apos;s fixable, and what it might cost. A local shop can repair or replace a lot of parts on a phone and a trip to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-repair-partner-ubreakifix-now-asurion-tech-repair-and-solutions">uBreakiFix store</a> might be just what the doctor ordered. </p>
<p>The sad reality is that phones are disposable consumer electronics and aren&apos;t designed to be serviced and repaired. Once your phone is out of warranty or an extended service contract, you&apos;re simply expected to buy a new one when it stops working the way it should.</p><p>With phones seeing seven years of software support, this may have to change. Until then, your best bet is to consider an extended warranty.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Galaxy Ring leak claims to have spotted several model numbers for the product, indicative of several sizes Samsung plans to provide.</li><li>The discovery highlights the existence of eight model numbers, with speculation that a ninth could be available on launch.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring is rumored to feature American ring sizes ranging from 5 to 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to shed light on the existence of several Galaxy Ring sizes for consumers later this year.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-ring/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), Samsung&apos;s first smart ring could arrive in nine sizes as the device&apos;s model numbers appear (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-sizes-model-numbers-leak/">SamMobile</a>). An initial discovery showed that the Galaxy Ring will be placed under Samsung&apos;s new "Q" series for model identification. As such, the following model numbers echo that moniker.</p>
<ul><li><strong>SM-Q500</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q501</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q502</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q505</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q506</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q507</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q508</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q509</strong></li></ul>
<p>There will apparently be nine ring sizes, although the publication&apos;s digging only unearthed eight Galaxy Ring models. Supposedly, the Galaxy Ring will "correspond" with American ring sizes when it hits the market, which would mean the device would range from size 5 to size 13. That range encompasses nine sizes, so we may see one more during the launch.</p><p>Speculation states the ninth model number would feature the "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model numbers.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Ring&apos;s model numbers are seemingly listed in order of smallest (SM-Q500) to largest (SM-Q509).</p>

<p>Galaxy Ring development was reported to begin in May as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-release-unit-production-rumor">a previous rumor</a> suggests Samsung plans to produce 400,000 units in time for launch. The size of the Galaxy Ring could cause Samsung to have "no shortage" of parts, meaning it might be flexible enough to meet demand if the market dictates.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">appearance at MWC 2024</a> with its smart ring confirmed that it will debut in platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black finishes. Following a Samsung executive&apos;s deleted LinkedIn post, there is an expectation that the company will unveil the Galaxy Ring during the second half of 2024. This could line up perfectly with the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">second Galaxy Unpacked</a> event, which could take place on July 10 in Pairs, France.</p>

<hr>
<p>The OnePlus Ace 3 Pro is the next anticipated smartphone from the company after it launched the Ace 3 and Ace 3V in March this year. While the launch details are yet to be determined, new information from the prolific tipster reveals what to expect from the next handset from OnePlus for the Chinese region.</p><p>According to the tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942#:~:text=19%2006%3A31-,Ace3p%E2%80%99s,-new%20machine%20has">Digital Chat Station</a> on Weibo, the upcoming OnePlus Ace 3 Pro will be a performance-driven flagship Android phone from the company featuring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC underneath coupled with at least 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.53%;"><img id="LCjG56xb3SfZiQBwZwKu5a" name="OnePlus-Ace-3-Pro-leaked-details.jpg" alt="Leaked details about the OnePlus Ace 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCjG56xb3SfZiQBwZwKu5a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="865" height="290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device will also have a metal frame sandwiched between a 1.5K curved screen and a glass body texture featuring a new coating process, the tipster notes. The other parameters include a 50MP primary camera, presumably the same one we saw early this year on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, and a telephoto lens that may have 2x zoom. Digital Chat Station further hints at a significant battery capacity bump over the previous one.</p><p>The new Pro device will be coming as the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-2-pro-launch">Ace 2 Pro</a> from last year. Similar to previous models, last year&apos;s variant was exclusive to the Chinese market. However, the first Ace Pro was rebranded as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review">OnePlus 10T</a> for the global market, while the company chose to skip the next iteration (OnePlus 11T) for the global market last year. </p><p>If the company releases the OnePlus 12T this year, it will presumably be a rebranded Ace 3 Pro. While the launch is still speculative at this point, per the previous model launch time frame, we can expect the device to see the light of day sometime this fall in the Chinese region, followed by a global debut if the company chooses to launch so.</p>

Per the screenshots shared by AssembleDebug, users will see the Music option in the Gemini Settings, which notes, "Select preferred services used to play music."</p>

<p>While the new functionality is still in the works, the official rollout might be just around the corner. Meanwhile, Gemini was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-will-soon-be-added-to-the-google-app-on-android">recently spotted</a> in the Google search app for Android with a new toggle switch.</p><p>The toggle switch was seen on the Google search app&apos;s Discover feed, allowing users to shift between Google Search and Gemini Assistant. The same approach was also seen on the Google app for iOS, although this functionality is also still in the works and is yet to be available to the public. </p><p>It looks like Google is prepping up with some juicy updates for its Gemini assistant, which we may hear more about at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> in May.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Google's Circle to Search code seemingly shows two new updates on the way: "Copy Image" and "Share Image."</li><li>The former option will let users edit the snapshot they've taken through the Android editor before placing it elsewhere.</li><li>"Share Image" lets users in Circle to Search quickly share what they've highlighted instead of running a query through the Search engine.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Circle to Search seems primed to pick up two new options that could help speed up our queries and sharing.</p><p>As spotted by AssembleDebug via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/20/circle-to-search-copy-share-images/">PunikaWeb</a>, Google&apos;s gesture-based search feature is preparing to roll out the "Copy Image" and "Share Image" options. When tapping the former, the code suggests users will be able to copy what is contained within Circle to Search&apos;s frame. After which, the captured snapshot will be thrown into the device&apos;s image editor.</p><p>Users are said to find extra options like editing, annotations, and a share option for "supported apps."</p><p>The tipster discovered that the "Share Image" option only lets users quickly send what they&apos;ve screenshot to others. When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is active, highlighting a specific area and tapping "Share Image" will immediately produce Android&apos;s sharing sheet full of contacts and apps.</p><p>It also seems that users can toss that screenshot into their Cloud storage.</p><p>Additionally, Google is preparing to alter the design of the area of selection users see when using Circle to Search. Instead of the rounded corners that put things into a frame, users will soon see the classic pull tabs, similar to highlighting text, which should make it easier to adjust the selected area.</p><p>The tipster suggests Google is preparing to bring these new additions to Circle to Search on Pixel devices. But it seems fair to expect these features and changes to arrive on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, too.</p>

<p>Google revealed its AI-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> back in January. The feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/circle-to-search-rolling-out-to-google-pixel-8">lets Pixel 8 series owners</a> and the Galaxy S24 search for items by scribbling, highlighting, or tapping items on their display. Doing so will produce a small menu from the bottom of the UI that features Google Search&apos;s answer to whatever was selected. </p><p>Moreover, users have the option to add a question alongside the snapshot Circle to Search popped into the engine. Highlighting clothing options brings up relevant retail options from across the web.</p><p>In March, Google brought the handy AI feature to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-will-roll-out-to-more-devices">even more Android devices</a>, such as the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Samsung even rolled it out for all of its flagship devices launched in 2023. Circle to Search was upgraded during that time, as the company included translation functionality.</p><p>Users were given a translate icon (similar to Google Translate) that will automatically display a section&apos;s text in a preferred language.</p>

<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDR2X3M">Amazon - $849.99</a> | <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926uzkaxaa/">Samsung - $999.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-512gb-unlocked-onyx-black/6569852.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="49b6ab39-d366-40e1-9765-eb6b33e04245" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Just like past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> with "Plus" in the name, this S24 device is all about balance. The Plus isn&apos;t quite as large or as powerful as the premium Galaxy S24 Ultra, but you get more RAM and better specs than the base model. I&apos;m talking about thoughtful details like a stunning AMOLED QHD+ 6.7-inch display, an outstanding battery that&apos;ll last all day with ease, and a sleek, flat panel construction that reminded us of an iPhone. And of course, like the other phones in the Galaxy S24 series, you&apos;ll be getting seven years of software support and access to all of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that you&apos;ve been hearing about.</p><p>Sure, if you have an old device to trade in or you want to make a change to your wireless service, there are certainly better <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S24 deals</a> out there. But if you prefer the no-strings simplicity of an unlocked phone, this is the best deal you&apos;re going to find (at least until Prime Day rolls around).</p>
