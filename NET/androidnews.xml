<ul><li>According to recent reports, Gemini can be widely used in split-screen mode on large-screen Android devices.</li><li>The said devices can include foldable phones and large Android tablets.</li><li>The reports say the new window was seen on devices like Pixel Tablet, Pixel Fold, and Galaxy Tab series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Large-screen Android devices are primarily highlighted for their multitasking capabilities, which include split-screen views. Google's Gemini was one such app that supported split-screen views for Galaxy foldables earlier and is now expanding to many other such large-screen devices, per multiple reports.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/29/gemini-split-screen/">9to5Google</a>, the Gemini overlay window on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> now showcases a split screen button previously limited to Galaxy foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p>

<p>Having Gemini in split screen view is particularly useful when you quickly want to research something on the other half of the screen while you might be reading, watching, or even hearing a podcast, for example. It lets you find out about something without leaving or juggling between apps, and it is super useful for large-screen devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> or other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/gemini-split-screen-mode-galaxy-tab/">SamMobile</a> also notes that Samsung's latest Galaxy Tab series also supports the split screen view for the Gemini app. When users trigger the AI assistant, they can now see an overlay window of the Gemini, which they normally do. However, the new button makes putting it in a floating window or split-screen view easier.</p>
<p>The latest addition comes after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assisant-actions-to-replace-gemini-extensions-on-android">recent transition</a> of Google Assistant actions, which are now run by Gemini. It would allow users to send texts on WhatsApp and Google Messages using Gemini — previously performed by Google Assistant actions.</p><p>Gemini integration has also been widely seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">recent times</a> across several Google apps, such as the Chat app, which got a summarize button as part of the latest update. Similarly, Gemini's popular "Help me write" was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-ai-is-swooping-into-gmail-on-the-web-to-supercharge-your-email">recently ventured</a> into Gmail for the web, including a new "Polish" button.</p><p>Google is expected to roll out the next iteration of the underlying Gemini model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-2-dot-0-likely-to-launch-in-december-2024">in December</a>, according to reports. It will likely be dubbed Gemini 2.0 and become a successor to the current Gemini 1.5 Pro model.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it's bringing Google Wallet and tap-to-pay support to Family Link devices next year.</li><li>The functionality will let kids use cards and passes on their devices with parental supervision.</li><li>After first appearing on the Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch, it'll soon come to Family Link Android devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a long-requested feature to Android phones managed with Family Link next year: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> for kids. The company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/30/google-wallet-kids/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> that starting in 2025, kids will be able to download the Google Wallet app on supervised Family Link devices, making contactless payments possible. Of course, there will be a handful of tools and limitations that give parents control of their child's activity.</p><p>For starters, the version of Google Wallet making its way to kids won't include support for online payments. Kids can make in-store purchases using Google Wallet's tap-to-pay feature, but can't buy things online. Additionally, parents will have to approve a credit or debit card before it can be added to their child's Google Wallet app. Every time a kid wants to make a purchase, they'll need to authenticate the contactless payment — just like on the full Google Wallet app. </p><p>Google Wallet for kids became popularized with the release of the Fitbit Ace LTE earlier this year, a smartwatch designed for children. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> supports contactless payments, and now, Google will bring a similar experience to more devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">managed with Family Link</a>. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3" name="add-card-to-google-wallet-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Add new card to Google Wallet on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqR97nhWDLouM2SmndZgF3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents won't have to manually approve every payment, but they will see a transaction history for their child's purchases. If something goes wrong, Family Link managers can remotely remove a Google Wallet card from their child's devices. In all, the experience will be similar to handing a child a credit or debit card — but with one less thing for them to lose. </p><p>Some functionality is limited; kids can't add IDs or use health cards, but they can use event passes. It'll also be a somewhat limited rollout initially, starting with the U.S. and select countries in 2025, with a wider expansion to follow. </p><p>“Following the positive response of tap-to-pay on Fitbit Ace LTE devices, we’re expanding tap-to-pay for kids to Google Wallet," Google said in a statement to 9to5Google. "The new experience is built with safety in mind, and will allow parents to supervise their kids’ usage – including approving new cards, easily removing cards and viewing transaction history.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Google highlights a few new updates web surfers can use in its Chrome browser.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-performance-controls-october-2024/">Keyword post</a>, Google is rolling out a "Performance Detection" tool that continuously seeks ways to improve your browsing experience. The company says this tool will appear as an "Issue Alert" near your account icon. When this alert appears, Chrome will state which tabs require attention.</p><p>Chrome will bring these alerts to your attention when it feels other tabs are soaking up too much memory.</p><p>Google states users can click "Fix now" and the browser will do the rest. Users can disable this tool by heading into their browser's Settings.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post states Chrome is receiving more personalization for its performance-focused features. Now, users can decide which websites should remain active (even when in the background). Indicators for inactive tabs and memory usage information when hovering can be disabled.</p>

<p>Regarding customization, Google highlighted three new modes for Chrome's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-active-inactive-tab-control-spotted">Memory Saver</a>." The memory-freeing feature picks up the following options: Moderate, Balanced, and Maximum. Each mode becomes more aggressive depending on how Chrome views the situation. Google states the "Moderate" mode will deactivate tabs based on your computer's needs.</p><p>The "Balanced" option will consider your computer's memory and your actions in Chrome while "Maximum" is much quicker on the draw to deactivate an idle tab.</p><p>Google has continued to focus on its browser's performance ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-performance-modes">Memory Saver debuted</a> in 2022. The feature was simple since it automatically drew memory used in other inactive tabs to those you were actively using. This was designed to improve the browser's performance <em>and </em>your computer as more available memory means your multitasking goes by without a hitch.</p><p>Additionally, the company introduced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-memory-consumption-per-tab">memory usage tab information</a> in 2023 to join its Memory Saver function. This gave users quick and easy to see which tabs were hogging up all their memory so they could discard them. The update Google is preparing to roll in for Chrome is likely one that removes visual clutter and helps users streamline their experience.</p>

Most of the time, this means a bunch of words and different numbers on a spec sheet without any benefits that we can actually see, but this time, it should be different. Some of these changes are going to make differences that consumers like us will notice.</p><p>Most of the changes are under the hood, and for things, we aren't interacting with. However, the companies making devices and the people building out software solutions are, and these should make a marked improvement in things like Bluetooth connection stability, data speeds, and overall device battery life. The one big change is called Channel Sounding, and it's all about providing true spatial awareness to Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new-in-bluetooth-6-2">What's new in Bluetooth 6</h2>
<p>Bluetooth 6.0 brings six new sets of features to the specification:</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Channel Sounding</strong>: This brings real spatial and distance awareness to Bluetooth. This unlocks a whole host of enhancements and new capabilities. We'll have a look at this in its own section.</p><p><strong>Decision-Based Advertising Filtering: </strong>This isn't about advertisements like the ones you see on a website or social media. This is all about how signals and Bluetooth LE packets identify themselves to devices. This feature allows a device to use the contents of a data packet received on a primary device channel to decide if it needs to scan for related data packets on secondary channels. If that all sounds Greek to you, it's OK. What you need to know is this will cut back on data loss, and when a device doesn't have to fetch the same data twice, everything is faster.</p><p><strong>Monitoring Advertisers</strong>: Again, this has nothing to do with product advertising. This feature allows a device acting as an observer (the one receiving the data) to filter out duplicate data packets from the advertising device (the one doing the sending). It includes built-in protections to make sure a host device knows when another device moves out of range, which could be a problem if multiple packets are filtered out. This will save battery and improve Bluetooth latency.</p><p><strong>Isochronous Adaptation Layer Enhancement:</strong> This allows larger sets of data to be broken down into smaller data packets for faster transfer speeds. It also includes a new mode to reduce latency based on PDU framing. This is as technical as it sounds, but it means that latency for LE connections can be reduced, and data transfer can be improved.</p><p><strong>Frame Space update</strong>: Before Bluetooth 6, almost all data packets were spaced 150 microseconds apart. That sounds fast, but sometimes it was still slower than it needed to be, while other times it wasn't slow enough. With Bluetooth 6, the timing between data packets is negotiable and can be shorter or longer than 150 microseconds. This will improve connection stability</p><p>A lot of this sounds very technical and I've tried to trim it down to its simplest form. If you're interested in the core mechanics of any of these features, the Bluetooth SIG has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/core-specification-6-feature-overview/">a great resource paper</a> with all the details.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth-channel-sounding-2">Bluetooth Channel Sounding</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA" name="pebblebee-clip-google-find-my-device-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip Bluetooth tracker compatible with Google Find My Device on a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5JgWzUivHCApgbp7mRxhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding allows Bluetooth to be much more precise when determining where two or more Bluetooth devices are in relation to each other. Simply put, it means that two devices supporting the new feature can find each other across a wider area and <em>within a centimeter</em> of accuracy.</p><p>How it works is fascinating. It uses two distance measuring methods: Phase-Based Ranging and Round Trip Timing. These can be used separately or together and can achieve extremely accurate measurements.</p><p><strong>Phase-Based Ranging</strong> (PBR) uses the relationship between the phase, frequency, and wavelength of a radio signal. All signals have this relationship and PBR exploits it to calculate a distance.</p><p>1. The initiating device transmits a signal to the reflecting device.</p><p>2. The reflecting device echoes the signal back to the transmitting device.</p><p>3. The initiating device measures the phase of the signal it receives.</p><p>4. The process is repeated with a new signal, which results in a new phase measurement.</p><p>Distance is then calculated using a formula built on the frequency difference, the phase difference, and the speed of light. This is extremely accurate to a distance of 150 meters using a 1MHz signal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:20.89%;"><img id="h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f" name="BT6-PBR-calculation" alt="Bluetooth 6.0 PBR calulcation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4Nm36R5YqL652qb7Gzj6f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1862" height="389" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bluetooth SIG)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Round Trip Timing </strong>(RTT) measures the time it takes for a signal to travel from a transmitting device to a receiving device and back to where it originated. It's more simple and has a longer range than PBR.</p><p>1. The initiating device sends a data packet and records the Time of Departure (ToD).</p><p>2. The receiving device receives the packet and then echoes it back after a pre-determined delay.</p><p>3. The transmitting device receives the packet back and records a second timestamp called the Time of Arrival (ToA).</p><p>4. The distance is calculated using the difference between ToD and ToA with the predetermined delay calculated into the formula, multiplied by the speed of light.</p><p><em><strong>N * 299792458 m/s = X</strong></em></p><p>It also takes time to calculate the sending, timing, and receiving of a signal, which is determined by the hardware and inserted into the result, giving an accurate measurement of distance. This is very close to the way a dedicated ToF sensor in a camera assembly works to measure focal distance.</p><p>RTT can provide 100% accurate distance measurement, but the device hardware is unable to be perfectly precise, so there will always be a very small range of errors.</p><p>This is just a high-level but (hopefully) simplified overview of the technology. To learn more about Bluetooth Channel Sounding, including the full technical details, see the white paper on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/channel-sounding-tech-overview/">Bluetooth SIG website</a>.</p>

<p>Bluetooth Channel Sounding also incorporates several strong security features that help prevent distance spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. These include signal randomization, robust encryption, and the ability to cross-check signal path and distance between PBR and TFF measurements.</p><p>All of this makes Bluetooth 6 a much better solution for services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">Find My networks</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-locks">digital keys and smart locks</a>, and even your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-mice-chromebooks">Bluetooth mouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-expect-bluetooth-6-devices-2">When to expect Bluetooth 6 devices</h2>
<p>As of the time of this writing, no Bluetooth 6-enabled devices have been announced. The new specification was released in August of 2024, and all device manufacturers have access to the full range of features. That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> supports Bluetooth 6, so it may be only a matter of time before smartphone OEMs start incorporating it into their devices.</p>

<p>Next to the chipset, the OnePlus 13 also has ample storage options with up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of onboard storage. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phone</a> from OnePlus also uses a new upgraded Vapor Cooling system that promises better thermal conductivity.</p><p>For better gaming, the OnePlus 13 also supports 120fps gameplay support for large-scale mobile games. OnePlus is also introducing a new Bionic Vibration Motor Turbo, which should give you notable haptic feedback while gaming and while performing relevant system-wide tasks.</p><p>While the OnePlus 13's screen size isn't much different from the previous iteration, it does utilize a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">2K Oriental screen</a> from BOE—the second-generation LTPO panel measuring 6.82 inches with 120Hz refresh rate support. It's a mostly flat display, although with <em>slight</em> curves on each side. Also, for the first time on a OnePlus phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-specs-and-other-essential-features-surface">ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</a> under the display is a new addition. Previous models relied on optical fingerprint sensors.</p>
<p>The Hasselblad camera integration is again present on the OnePlus 13, which has a triple camera setup featuring a 50MP Sony LYT-808 primary lens, aided by a 50MP periscope telephoto sensor and another 50MP ultra-wide-angle sensor. The device also relies on a 32MP selfie shooter on the front.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 6,000mAh battery, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery introduced</a> by the company in June. It supports OnePlus's super fast 100W wired charging and 50W wireless fast charging. The company is promising to juice up the higher battery capacity to full in a mere 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the touch of AI is also seen on the OnePlus 13 across several departments, like the AI Assistant's ability to recognize what's on screen and answer your questions. There is also AI voice summary for calls, AI photo editing, and more. The device is shipping with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based ColorOS 15, which is, of course, confined to China, while the global variant will likely ship with OxygenOS 15.</p><p>The device also gets a nifty IP69 rating, alongside the conventional IP68 rating, which should now handle higher-temperature and higher-pressure water jets.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 starts at CNY 4499 ($632) for the 12GB+256GB variant and goes all the way up to CNY 5999 (~$843) for the larger 24GB+1TB storage variant. The device features three colorways: White Dew Dawn, Obsidian Sercrnet Realm, and Blues Hour (Translated). With the early China launch, we can expect the global launch of the OnePlus 13 to happen sooner rather than later.</p>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI's take on search is here as ChatGPT begins rolling it out today (Oct 31) for Plus, Team, and SearchGPT waitlist users first.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">a blog post</a>, OpenAI states users can find Search available via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search">ChatGPT's web</a> and mobile apps. When opening the app, users will find the standard "Message ChatGPT" text box with a new globe icon for Search. OpenAI states the AI will decide to scour the web "based on what you've asked;" however, the new button is there to force the model into an online search.</p><p>The backbone of this new ChatGPT Search feature is the company's interest in delivering "better answers" quickly.</p><p>The post states users can type to ChatGPT using "natural and conversational" speech. After asking a question, the AI will respond with information sourced from other websites. OpenAI highlights its partnership with news and data providers to ensure ChatGPT's answers include "up-to-date information."</p><p>ChatGPT Search also piggybacks off partner-provided data and<em> </em>information via third-party search engines and a "fine-tuned" variant of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">GPT-4o</a>.</p><p>OpenAI states its ChatGPT Search offers a button at the bottom of its response labeled "Sources." Initially, the pill-shaped icon will display a few icons from the sources it grabbed its information. Clicking on this button will produce a sidebar with the website names and article titles.</p><p>Users can click on these to learn more — and to fact-check the AI model.</p><p>Additionally, OpenAI states users can ask follow-up questions after ChatGPT delivers a response. The post claims the AI will take the "full context" of what you said to search for a "better answer."</p>

<p>ChatGPT Search will arrive for Enterprise and Edu users "in the next few weeks." Finally, free users are set to pick it up "over the coming months."</p><p>We've been expecting OpenAI's take on search with ChatGPT ever since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-engine-rumored">it was rumored</a> earlier this year. Those rumors were based on a discovery within OpenAI's certificate logs <em>and </em>comments by its CEO, Sam Altman. The company's head was on a podcast and reportedly discussed AI alongside search.</p><p>One thing for sure is that ChatGPT Search will sit opposite Google's AI model Gemini and its AI Overviews in Search. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">AI Overviews</a> are closer to what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT Search. The company launched its quick, bite-sized boxes of information in Search during I/O 2024 in May. Google has upgraded its AI Overviews with backlinking to fact-check the AI's responses and a more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">organized</a>" view.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google detailed a series of Android SDK updates, including more for its Play Store and Gemini.</p><p>Google's updates kicked off by highlighting the future of its Android SDK. In a blog post, the company states it will bring "more frequent" SDK releases, beginning in 2025. Google states it will have a "major" release in Q2 that contains "behavior changes" for apps. This seems to be Android 16 as Google states developers should keep their eyes out for more information regarding its first preview. The company states app developers can prepare for the major Q2 2025 release by conducting the "annual compatibility testing" a few months sooner.</p><p>The minor SDK release in Q4 2025 will contain feature updates, optimizations, and bug fixes to clean up any issues with the intended major Q2 launch.</p><p>Q1 and Q3 2025 will be minor, offering "feature only" updates to developers, per Google's set timeline.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-android-studio-updates-2">Gemini in Android Studio Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Following the debut of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-in-android-studio-debut">Gemini in Android Studio</a>" in April, Google's latest updates today (Oct 31) bring several more capabilities to the AI model. The company is pushing the boundaries of its AI by boosting its coding capabilities, allowing it to edit your work by "implementing common design patterns." Several of Gemini's new code editing features include the ability to "modify and refractor" code based on custom prompts.</p><p>A commit message generation feature lets the AI analyze your changes and propose its own set of alterations. "Rethink and rename" lets Gemini generate names for your coding classes, methods, and variables. "Prompt Library" enables the AI to "automatically" save and manage a user's most frequently used prompts for easy recall. Users can also generate documentation for a select chunk of code by right-clicking.</p><p>In the Android Studio, Gemini can now auto-generate "composable" previews and simplify the visualization process for your intended UI. Moreover, "coming soon," Google says Gemini in Android Studio will support image attachments.</p><p>As Gemini in Android Studio picks up a Ladybug feature drop, developers can weed out bugs quicker and (hopefully) see fewer crashes. Additional features include test scenarios using local code context, build/sync error insights, and app quality insights for suggested crash fixes.</p><p>The latest updates to the Android Studio can be downloaded via the Canary channel.</p>
<h2 id="play-store-updates-2">Play Store Updates</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a separate blog post, the company states it's changing how apps are displayed on its store. These new formats include a full-screen mode for portrait videos in an app store listing. Google states a more "prominent" install button should now be visible to users.</p><p>Google highlights the Play Store's "personalized" query recommendations. According to the post, users can find these recommended search queries via the "Search Home." This is available for English with support for additional languages set to arrive "soon this year."</p><p>Google's "interest picker" arrived to help the Play Store understand where your interests are for accurate recommendations. The company rolled out a similar tool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-july-2024-new-updates/">for games in July</a>.</p><p>The post adds that the Play Store delivers a more robust security system when purchasing content. The company says users can now choose "on-device biometrics" when purchasing an app. This includes deciding between using your fingerprint or face to authenticate a purchase instead of inputting your account's password.</p>

<p>The final two updates for the Play Store involve boosting revenue for developers and their apps alongside Play Integrity API upgrades. Concerning the former, Google states that it has "proactively" encouraged users to assign a payment method on the Play Store and within the Android OS. This has reportedly "doubled the number of purchases" in 2024 and provided a nearly 3% increase in conversion rate.</p><p>Payment options have continued to expand as users find options like Paypal, Cash App, direct carrier billing, and more. Additionally, Google highlights its Play Store algorithm for pushing what content users might buy as additional content for their favorite apps.</p><p>Google also highlighted its "gentle nudge," an alert that reminds users of an item they've forgotten in their cart.</p><p>Google states, "in the coming months," developers can opt into improved Play Integrity API verdicts to bolster their app's defenses. What's more, Google's "app access risk" feature has exited beta. Developers can now "detect and respond" to apps that capture a user's screen or control their device to avoid security disasters.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Maps is getting smarter. Soon, it will serve up spot-on suggestions, bite-sized review summaries, and answers all your random questions about places.</p><p>Google announced today that Maps will be a lot handier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>-curated inspiration. So, if you&apos;re planning a night out, you can simply type in “things to do with friends at night,” and get suggestions like live music.</p><p>You&apos;ll also be able to skim through quick review summaries to see what people love, and if you&apos;re curious about the vibe, just ask Maps directly.</p><p>These new features are rolling out on Android and iOS in the U.S. this week. Over the next few months, expect similar upgrades on Google Search, including AI-powered review summaries and the ability to ask about specific details of places.</p><p>Google is also shaking up AI with "grounding" in Maps, letting developers plug into a database of more than 250 million places. Now, AI content can be spot-on and up-to-date, staying real with the latest information.</p><p>Furthermore, the company is making road trips way easier. Just grab directions, tap “add stops,” and get a list of the best landmarks, scenic views, attractions, and food spots along the way.</p><p>Navigating through new areas with a mess of lanes and turns should no longer be a hassle, thanks to the service&apos;s upgraded maps lay out lanes, crosswalks, and road signs nice and clear. You can also forget those last-second merges; just stick to the blue lane markers, and you’re all set for a smooth ride.</p><p>A few months back, the navigation app started highlighting buildings in red as you near your destination. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> has stepped it up—showing you nearby parking and even reminding you to save your spot so you don’t forget. Once you’re parked, you’ll get walking directions straight to the entrance, with Street View or AR to help you get oriented in no time.</p><p>This week, you can start exploring your route, check and report weather issues, and enjoy updated arrival guidance on Android and iOS everywhere. Plus, next month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/game-changing-google-maps-enhanced-navigation-update-arrives-next-month">Google is launching enhanced navigation</a> in over 30 metro areas, with plans to add even more spots down the line.</p><p>Additionally, Immersive View is expanding to 150 cities globally, including cool spots like Brussels, Kyoto, and Frankfurt.</p><p>Immersive View for routes is about to get even better. You’ll now find out where to park and get warnings for tricky turns, so you’re ready for anything. This update is rolling out this week on Android and iOS wherever you can use Immersive View for routes.</p>

While WB is busy trying to make the next successful live service game from the shell of the successful franchise, it's the Iron Man VR developers that actually delivered the single-player Batman Arkham game we've been clamoring for.</p>

<p>Batman: Arkham Shadow returns to the series' roots, something I've wanted since Arkham Knight. In many ways, it's identical to the way Ubisoft handled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus VR</a> when it was released on Quest last year. Instead of a daunting open world, Batman: Arkham Shadow focuses on a key area of the world — Blackgate Prison — and cuts out the unnecessary padding and fluff open world games so often suffer from, as Michael pointed out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">in his hands-on</a> of the game.</p><p>Because of this, Batman: Arkham Shadow feels laser-focused on its intriguing story, which follows The Rat King's rise and the scourge that both The Rats and the corrupt police have brought upon Gotham. It's a story that wedges itself between the events in Arkham Origin and Arkham Asylum, helping to fill in the gaps about what happened to Gordon, Bruce, and Gotham City as a whole.</p><p>Batman: Arkham Shadow is a Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S exclusive game developed by Camouflaj and published by Oculus Studios. It's more than worth noting that this game <em>would not exist</em> without Meta funding it, and Rocksteady was not the primary developer. However, Camouflaj did pull some seasoned Arkham talent onboard, like Bill Green, who was the head designer for all previous Arkham games and helped lead game and level design on Arkham Shadow, as well.</p>

<p>The transition from flatscreen gaming to VR was a challenge for Camouflaj, but one the studio is specifically primed for. As studio director and founder Ryan Payton told me, Camouflaj isn't one to shy away from pushing the boundaries of what people thought was possible for VR gaming.</p><p>In Batman: Arkham Shadow, you'll fight multiple enemies at a time, sneak around in the vents, hop from vantage point to vantage point, glide around using Batman's cape, throw Batarangs to flip switches or disarm enemies, and use plenty of gadgets like the grapple hook to move around quickly and stealthily. These are all things Arkham fans expect from an Arkham-branded game, and every one of them has been lovingly recreated in VR.</p><p>But then there's the spatial awareness that you can only feel and understand when wearing a VR headset. Meta has been prominently using "Become the Knight" as the tagline in ads for the game, and while that might sound cliche to those who aren't familiar with VR gaming, there's something truly visceral and personal that happens when you do the literal cowl by wearing a Quest 3.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Developer Camouflaj isn't one to shy away from pushing the boundaries of what people thought was possible for VR gaming.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Suddenly, the monologue that takes place during story sequences becomes your own monologue. Inward thoughts from Bruce Wayne feel personal, and the anger and deception the character of Batman feels turn into your own as your blood pumps and sweat drips down your face.</p><p>Finishing a fight against 20 enemies at once feels like you just got out of a back alley brawl, as your muscles will ache, and you'll truly feel like you've just taken out those bad guys in real life.</p><p>Likewise, crouching in the vents, grabbing enemies from behind, and zipping between gargoyles elicits feelings that are very different from the flatscreen Arkham games. Sure, there have been plenty of moments throughout the storied franchise where I've felt tense or excited during stealth segments or during combat, but doing all of this yourself instead of mashing buttons on a controller is a very different experience that breathes new life into familiar mechanics.</p>

<p>Case in point, I noticed a trend in reviews for the Arkham series as it progressed from Asylum to City, Origins to Knight, where people commented that some of the mechanics and locations were starting to feel tired. You can only do the same thing so many times before you get tired of it, but people also don't want to deviate too far from something they love.</p><p>That's particularly what Arkham Shadow does well. It features the Metroidvania level design from Arkham Asylum with its "hub world" that revolves around Blackgate Prison and certain sections of Arkham City. Much like Asylum, you'll be revisiting places once you've acquired specific gadgets, each of which grants you access to places you weren't able to access previously.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w9SebYjuiyVJxifsKMUa55" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-Screenshot-06" alt="A screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow taken on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w9SebYjuiyVJxifsKMUa55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each gadget is designed to be both familiar and accessible in VR in clever ways. For instance, you'll aim with the Batarang by looking at your target and then physically throwing the tool. It feels a lot like eye-tracking and will be an even better mechanic once that tech is more commonplace.</p><p>If I had to levy any complaint against the Metroidvania design in this game, it would be that I often forgot where I needed to go back for secrets. The game's story guides you back through necessary areas via audio cues very well, but I'd love a way to tag a specific part of the map to make a waypoint for when I unlock the explosive gel, for instance. There are plenty of collectibles throughout the game, and as a classic gamer, I love finding and grabbing each one as I go.</p>

<p>In my first interview with the team at Camouflaj, Batman: Arkham Shadow's combat was described as being heavily influenced by Beat Saber and SUPERHOT VR, two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. Beat Saber's influence can be directly felt in the pseudo-rhythmic nature of the combat and the different movements you'll need to make to feel like Batman.</p><p>This isn't Blade & Sorcery or another VR action game where you might find yourself flailing around to cheese the physics system. You'll need to punch in specific directions, hit a certain number of times, and ensure you follow the prompts to complete a combat-specific move.</p><p>Sometimes, that's delivering an uppercut followed by a punch to the face for a knockout. Other times, it's knocking an enemy senseless with five straight jabs followed by a shoulder grab and a kick to the face. At all times, this combat feels visceral and authentic, and juggling between enemies is as easy as reaching toward them with a closed fist.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>This isn't one of those games where you might find yourself flaling around to cheese the physics system. You'll need to punch in specific directions, hit a certain number of times, and ensure you follow the prompts to complete a combat specific move.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Countering enemies is just as easy, but you'll need to properly time the counter instead of simply reaching toward the enemy. A handy gauge appears to let you know an attack is incoming, and a grab toward that direction when the gauge is blue will successfully counter.</p><p>As you progress through the game, new enemies will require new tactics to dispatch. After a few hours, you'll be tapping the right stick forward to leap over enemies with stun batons, while you'll need to do a cape swing or explosive gel blast to stun more heavily armored enemies before punching them.</p><p>I will say that while this combat is incredibly exciting and rewarding, it's not terribly friendly for folks who like to sit on a couch. That doesn't mean it's not possible, but I often found myself angling my body weirdly when juggling between multiple enemies. I never had this problem when playing the game while standing.</p>

<p>Playing the rest of the game while seated is easy, thanks to the quick height-adjustment option. Just hold down the menu button and it'll set your height to that of Batman's, making you feel tall, dark, and handsome no matter your height or preference for seated or standing positions.</p><p>This kind of design is important for all sorts of folks. Whether you need to play seated because you feel nauseous when playing while standing, or you have a disability and cannot physically stand, Arkham Shadow is here for you. If you're not quite Batman's height, the game will make you feel Batman's height and size, transporting you properly into the psyche of the Dark Knight.</p><p>I actually found that I enjoyed playing some of the stealth Predator areas more while seated and the game's quick height adjustment made it easy to quickly swap between these two. Likewise, I preferred to physically crouch while sneaking around whereas other players might just want to click in the right stick to toggle between crouching or standing states.</p><p>Camouflaj worked to get options in here for all sorts of players and play styles, and it paid off marvelously.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-batman-arkham-shadow-a-vr-game-2">Why is Batman: Arkham Shadow a VR game?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wcmCStZ6kCEdTHTohJ5y75" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-Screenshot-01" alt="A screenshot from Batman: Arkham Shadow taken on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wcmCStZ6kCEdTHTohJ5y75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some players have asked, "Why is this a VR game?" As I covered in the intro, this one was paid for by Meta, so it makes sense that it's a VR-focused game. Rocksteady and WB as a whole have been tone-deaf for the past decade, and the push from major publishers to develop expensive live service games has done nothing but cause problems industry-wide.</p><p>Batman: Arkham Shadow is an incredibly well-made, high-quality single-player game that'll take you around 10-15 hours to complete. That's the same length as Arkham Asylum and it includes combat and Predator mode challenges that you can play to either train yourself or just have fun when you're not delving through the main story.</p><p>As far as the VR question goes, my best response to that is that being in VR gave Camouflaj the ability to make classic Arkham mechanics feel fresh and new again. Like anything popular and good in the gaming industry, most third-person brawler games have adapted Arkham's combat and it makes Arkham feel more generic than it used to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qzgeuD394q2VRMssZqbC55" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-Screenshot-08" alt="A screenshot from Batman Arkham Shadow taken on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qzgeuD394q2VRMssZqbC55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This game would not exist without Meta funding it, and Rocksteady was not the primary developer.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Likewise, games like the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man series have even aped Arkham's predator stealth mechanics, once again making Arkham feel more generic as the series ages. Batman: Arkham Shadow does an amazing job of feeling like an Arkham game without feeling like it's the same game you played a decade ago, and that's because of what changing perspective does.</p><p>Just as a first-person shooter feels palpably different on a TV than a third-person shooter, Batman: Arkham Shadow feels palpably different from Arkham Asylum while still feeling familiar enough to please fans. It also does all the normal stuff a VR games do well — immersion, scale, emotional connection to characters — including interaction with the world at large.</p><p>I was surprised to see that some environmental objects weren't interactable, though. You can pick up a newspaper and read it, you can find hidden radios that The Rat King broadcasts on, and you can even pick up memory echoes that bring you back to Bruce Wayne's past in ways that Batman fans will care about. However, you can't pick up most mugs or bottles and smash them, something I think would have been good to do for some of the stealth parts of the game.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>It proves that the series' original developers aren't needed to make something truly great.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's difficult to pick my favorite moments from the game. Walking around Blackgate Prison gave me "Chronicles of Riddick" vibes, something Payton told me was a big inspiration for the team during development. Hearing the prisoners talk about Batman's latest catch or what the Penguin was doing felt like I was spying in on a conversation I wasn't supposed to hear, and fighting and capturing famed Batman villains felt satisfying in a way I've never felt before.</p><p>One of the most clutch mechanics is detective mode, which is activated by holding the controller to the side of your head and pressing the trigger. It's a satisfying mechanic that activates a sort of X-ray vision that makes it easier to figure out what you're supposed to do, especially when buttons and gates are involved.</p><p>Some of the dedicated detective sections will have you piecing together clues by scanning objects in a room or area, but you can always scan random objects in the world with detective vision, Metroid Prime style.</p>

<p>Does this game evolve the formula in important ways? Definitely. It opens up the series to a new perspective and paves the way for a more open world, one that could be achieved on more powerful hardware that'll inevitably ship with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a>. More importantly, it proves that the series' original developers aren't needed to make something truly great.</p><p>If Batman: Arkham Shadow's overall quality and fun factor lead other publishers to trust that storied franchises can be handled by proven developers like Camouflaj, then I consider it a win for any fan who wants more from a series or universe. Arkham Shadow isn't just a win for the Meta Quest platform or VR; it's a win for the industry as a whole. It proves that successful games can branch out to new mediums without ruining the original feel, and that's what really matters to me.</p>

<p>Google Maps first guided drivers to the correct lane for an exit in a 2014 update. A decade later, a November Google Maps update will make lanes fully visible on the map itself and guide users to the correct lane well before an exit.</p><p>While Maps will tell you now which lane you need one or two miles before an exit, you may get in the side lane too soon and take the wrong exit, or turn into the wrong lane so that you can't get over quickly enough for the <em>next</em> exit.</p><p>In the photos below, you can see how the Google Maps update will make it immediately clear where you need to be, zooming in to show the correct lane well before an exit and guiding you left or right <em>after</em> a turn.</p><p>This enhanced navigation feature will roll out to Google Maps in November on iOS and Android in 30 U.S. metro areas, but a Google Maps rep assured me at the announcement event that they "have no intention of stopping in the U.S.," eventually rolling out to more countries and cities. Google also said that Android Auto and CarPlay will take longer to receive this update.</p>

Any incidents reported on either app will appear on the other.</p><p>With this new Google Maps update, they've expanded the kind of things you can report on Google Maps to include flooding, unplowed snow, and dangerous fog. And on Waze, they've added a tool called "Conversational Reporting" where you tap a mic button and describe the problem to Gemini, which will interpret your words and create a relevant report that's shared to Waze and Maps users.</p><p>Not satisfied with these changes? Google Maps will add Gemini integration to Android and iOS in the upcoming week, too, with AI summaries of reviews and the option to search for specific qualities like "kid-friendly" or "iconic foods." I didn't want these enhanced navigation features to get lost in the AI shuffle, but we covered the flashier Garmin updates in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-ask-google-maps-for-spot-and-activity-ideas-thanks-to-gemini">this post</a>.</p><p>I've written in the past about my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-faster-route-available-sucks">frustration with Google Maps' rerouting tool during traffic</a>, and that remains true until Gemini does something to fix it. But in the meantime, proper lane guidance is exciting enough to make me enthusiastic about Google Maps again. I'm sick of the stress of potentially being in the wrong lanes for unfamiliar routes, and this update could fix that.</p>
