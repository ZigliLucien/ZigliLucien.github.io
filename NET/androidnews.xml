<ul><li>Starting in May, Visible will allow customers to <a href="https://www.visible.com/plans"><strong>pay for a full year of wireless service</strong></a> in advance instead of paying monthly. </li><li>Both of Visible's wireless plans are included in the update, with up to 26% in savings when you pre-pay for a full year. </li><li>This update comes only a month after <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/visibles-best-wireless-plan-just-got-even-better-without-raising-the-price">Visible upgraded its Plus plan</a> to include new perks at no additional cost. </li></ul>
<p>The Verizon-owned wireless carrier Visible Plus has been offering some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">our favorite data plans</a> for years now, but they somehow keep getting better. Starting in May, customers will be able to pay for a full year of wireless service in advance and receive up to 26% in savings. A full year of the basic Visible plan will cost $275 while 12 months of the Visible Plus plan will set you back $395 when you prepay. Since those two plans usually cost $25/month and $45/month, respectively, you could be looking at some serious savings. </p>

<p>Just a few weeks after rolling out an update that made their popular Plus plan even better, Visible has announced that they will begin offering annual payment options to new and existing wireless customers. Starting in May, pay for a full year in advance and you'll save 26% on the Visible Plus plan, no strings attached. </p>
<p>Both the Visible Basic plan and Visible Plus will remain otherwise unchanged, so if you prefer to pay monthly, you can continue to do so without any interruption. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ceb81ace-4bb7-417f-bd60-c6f93a630ada" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance" data-dimension48="Save up to 26% when you pay for a full year of Visible in advance">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The best value here is obviously the Visible Plus plan. Paying for a full year in advance will save you a whopping $145, and you still get all of the monthly perks included in the plan, such as unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries worldwide, unlimited data on Verizon&apos;s Ultra Wideband 5G network, and 50GB of premium data every month.</p><p>Now that the March update has been implemented, the Visible Plus plan also comes with an unlimited mobile hotspot that&apos;s twice as fast as the basic Visible plan, and you&apos;ll get one Global Pass day per month (that&apos;s unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data across 140 countries).</p><p>If Visible wasn&apos;t home to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-mvno-deals-of-month-year-is-it-time-to-switch">best MVNO deals</a> before, it certainly is now. Will 2024 see more changes from the Verizon-powered wireless carrier? Only time will tell, but in the meantime, there&apos;s never been a better time to switch.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>TECNO is emphasizing its camera-focused lineup with the launch of the Camon 30 Premier 5G.</li><li>The phone introduces TECNO's proprietary imaging system, promising groundbreaking features like 4K 30fps AI-noise reduction HDR video.</li><li>Beyond photography, the Camon 30 Premier excels in performance, with a large AMOLED display, MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, and ample RAM and storage options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO has finally launched the Camon 30 Premier 5G after showing it off during MWC 2024 in February, marking a big step for the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera-focused phone</a> lineup.</p><p>For the first time ever, the Camon 30 Premier 5G flaunts TECNO&apos;s very own imaging system. It&apos;s packing something TECNO claims is a game-changer, thanks to its 4K 30fps full-scene AI-noise reduction HDR video capability.</p><p>This means super crisp, detailed videos with true-to-life colors even if you&apos;re in dimmer settings, as per TECNO. This imaging setup, dubbed PolarAce, rocks Sony&apos;s CXD5622GG imaging chip to make all this happen. TECNO says you can even capture the breathtaking beauty of the auroras up north or the mesmerizing dusk scenes out in the desert.</p><p>On top of that, you&apos;ve got four 50MP lenses onboard, featuring a Sony IMX890 50MP OIS main camera. Additionally, there&apos;s a periscope-style telephoto lens thrown into the mix, giving you 3x optical zoom and 60x digital zoom. Plus, there&apos;s a macro lens in there too, promising to keep your subjects sharp even when you&apos;re just 2.5cm away.</p><p>Up front, the phone packs a punch with a 50MP selfie camera. It even tracks your eyes and focuses in a blink, so you&apos;ll always look your best in photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q" name="CAMON 30 Premier 5G-game.jpg" alt="Tecno Camon 30 Premier 5G in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PkyKx4ZnE2KERdcZSYeN3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But a phone is more than just its camera, and the Camon 30 Premier seems to have all bases covered for reliable performance. It rocks a 6.77-inch 120Hz AMOLED display, powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate 5G chip, with a whopping 24GB of RAM (including 12GB of extended memory) and a generous 512GB of flash storage.</p><p>While it&apos;s not a flagship chipset, it promises to keep things running smooth, even when you&apos;re using tons of apps or games. Plus, it&apos;s got this 10-layer "gaming-grade" cooling system and a massive 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>The battery supports 70W charging, juicing the phone up from 0 to 50% in a mere 16 minutes. TECNO claims this battery can handle a whopping 1,600 charge cycles and will keep at least 80% of its health for a solid four years.</p><p>Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-30-series-launch">Camon 30 series that made its debut earlier this month</a>, the Premier model comes packed with AI-based tricks. One of these, called AI Erase, claims to zap away unwanted stuff from your photos. Also in the mix is a feature called Universal Tone, which supposedly uses AI to nail down accurate skin tones in your snaps, no matter your complexion.</p><p>The Camon 30 Premier 5G is hitting store shelves globally starting in May. Pricing will vary by region, and it&apos;s not yet confirmed if it will be available in the United States (past TECNO phones haven&apos;t been).</p>

That probably left you with some questions: Why is this a setting and shouldn&apos;t it just be better all the time?</p><p>Spoiler — it&apos;s all a lie. There is no way to add more memory to your phone, and the amount that was put in when it was built can&apos;t ever be changed. However, some software trickery that might boost performance in theory can be done. This is what you&apos;re seeing, and here&apos;s the scoop on what it does and if you really should use it.</p>
<h2 id="everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-ram-2">Everything you ever wanted to know about RAM</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.98%;"><img id="3MkApJuPKcSpnobRVkkR9o" name="Industry’s-First-8Gb-LPDDR4-Mobile-DRAM-01.jpg" alt="Samsung mobile RAM" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MkApJuPKcSpnobRVkkR9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="449" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RAM stands for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-memory/support-what-does-computer-memory-do">Random Access Memory</a> and is hardware that every computer, including your phone, needs to operate. It&apos;s storage that holds data about the things you&apos;re doing and the apps you&apos;re actively using, and optimizing it is important because of its effect on performance.</p><p>RAM is fast. Your processor can communicate with it directly, and adding or retrieving data from it seems instant. There is no perceptible delay from the time the data moves in and out of RAM and the time whatever that does appears on your screen.</p>
<p>All operating systems have a way to manage how RAM is used, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/perf/lmkd">including Android</a>. Some of it has to be reserved for things like the cellular modem or video memory, so if your phone comes with 8GB of RAM, you only get to use about 6.5GB of it.</p><p>This is the portion used to load apps and their associated data. Your apps aren&apos;t installed in RAM (unless you&apos;ve done <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Linux%20and%20Virtualization/2349947_1.html">something crazy</a>) but they get loaded in when you open them. What I&apos;m saying is that having enough RAM and using it properly are important.</p>

<p>There are two things you might have heard before: "Android is Linux" and "free RAM is wasted RAM." Both are technically true, but it&apos;s really not that simple.</p><p>Android is not Linux the same way Ubuntu is Linux. Android is highly optimized for use in a low-power, low-resource system, and that means it manages memory very differently. A simple way to think of it is that your phone "learns" what apps you use and keeps those loaded into RAM so they can be opened instantly(ish). This is because of how it actually works — apps that are opened are kept in RAM until free space is needed, and then the app that&apos;s been there unused the longest gets purged to make room for something new. That&apos;s why people say free RAM is wasted.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel also can make use of a swap file. Windows and MacOS do the same. This is space on the storage drive that&apos;s marked to be used for storing apps and data for faster retrieval. If you open an app and it gets stored in the swap partition, it will load faster than it would if it weren&apos;t open at all.</p><p>This is what RAM Boost and other features like it are really doing. And you&apos;re probably better off not using them at all.</p>

<p>The idea of building a large dedicated space for data swapping on your storage drive is a good one. For you, it would allow more room to have more apps ready faster. Once all the technical details are addressed, it really does act like real physical RAM. That&apos;s why every computer does it on some level.</p><p>For the people who made your phone, it&apos;s a good way to spend less money and promise more performance. Companies know we love hearing that sort of thing, so they&apos;re more than happy to do it.</p>
<p>Your phone is not the same as a desktop PC, though, and using swap for application data transfer sucks — it&apos;s really, really slow. Slow 🐢. It&apos;s also unnecessary because Android was designed for phones without much memory, and it aggressively manages it all to compensate.</p><p>I&apos;m going to pick Motorola because I&apos;m more familiar with its RAM Boost feature, and it&apos;s the brand we tested here. Using RAM Boost makes a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> worse, not better. Apps regularly glitch out or crash, and switching apps is slower with the feature enabled.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sDWCtLAkRb6rmgwmhYKN5L" name="Moto-G-Play-2023-review-storage.jpg" alt="The Moto G Play (2023) internal storage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDWCtLAkRb6rmgwmhYKN5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why it&apos;s bad is easy to answer: the phone, like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> with a virtual RAM feature, uses eMMC storage. This type of storage is notoriously slow and is in no way suited to act as any swap drive. Reading chunks of data is no faster than opening an app in the first place, and data transfer in and out isn&apos;t fast enough for an app that expects data in a certain amount of time.</p><p>Faster storage media, like UFS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/emmc-to-ufs-how-nand-memory-for-mobile-products-is-evolving/">would be better</a>, but it&apos;s still not nearly as fast as physical RAM. You would still see performance issues using a RAM Boosting application on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS storage</a> device. </p>
<p>This isn&apos;t why I recommend you not use the feature, though. You can make your phone as slow as you like because it&apos;s yours. I say don&apos;t use it because eMMC flash storage isn&apos;t designed to be used this way, and doing it will prematurely kill your phone.</p><p>This kind of flash storage has a usable life of between 3,000 and 10,000 cycles. that means you can write or read data from a storage block about 3,000 times before it starts to go bad, and by the 10,000th time, it&apos;s expected that the block is dead. This can be compounded by the way to controller handles reading and writing when the size of the data doesn&apos;t match the size of a block.</p><p>In layman&apos;s terms, you&apos;re going to wear out the storage of your phone using RAM Boost long before you would if you don&apos;t.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:475px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.05%;"><img id="jSfGUQu4XdcUxTziabv8nG" name="loading.gif" alt="Loading ..." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jSfGUQu4XdcUxTziabv8nG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="475" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GIFER)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll be blunt: you can&apos;t expect the same performance from a budget phone that you would find in one that costs $1,000. We all know that.</p><p>If you are like me and love saving money and buying a good, cheap phone, accept and embrace it. You&apos;ll wait a second longer for an app to open, and your games won&apos;t run at 90 fps. That gives you time to think about the money you saved.</p><p>Using a feature like Motorola&apos;s RAM Boost isn&apos;t some magic fix and could wreck your phone long before you&apos;re ready to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">recycle it</a>.</p>

<p>The best NAS for Plex should let you stream your media collection to all connected devices in your home. </p><p>Plex is a terrific platform that lets you manage your media library with ease, and the service has a ton of useful extras when it comes to video playback. The best part is that the Plex client is available on just about every platform, making it straightforward to stream your content. And you don&apos;t need to pay anything to get started. </p><p>Plex has a paid tier called Plex Pass that gives you a ton of additional features, including the ability to use hardware transcoding. If you have a lot of older media that needs to be transcoded before being played back on TVs or phones, you may want to go this route. But for a majority of users, the free Plex media server is going to be more than adequate. </p><p>You can do plenty of other things with a NAS, including backing up photos and videos from all of your phones, setting up virtual machines, access powerful productivity software that doesn&apos;t need any monthly fee, and a whole lot more. NAS servers designed for Plex tend to have powerful hardware in general, unlocking a suite of enticing use cases in addition to streaming media.</p><p>I tested dozens of NAS models over the course of the last three years, and these are the best Plex NAS servers you can buy today.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS224+ is the best choice if you want a powerful NAS with standout software. The NAS can easily handle Plex transcodes, the Intel hardware is terrific in daily use, and the 2-bay server is affordable enough while still offering all the features you'll actually use.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS423+ runs the same Intel hardware as the DS224+, so it holds up just as well for Plex media streaming. The difference is that you get four drive bays here, and the dual M.2 slots allow you to add SSD storage.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS923+ is a powerful 4-bay server that does an amazing job as a Plex media server. The Ryzen hardware is more powerful than its Intel rival, but the downside is that you miss on Plex transcodes. If you don't need the feature, the DS923+ is a fantastic choice.</p>

<p>If you need a Plex server on a budget, the DS223j has a lot to offer. It misses out on some of the advanced features that you get in costlier NAS servers, but as a basic home media streaming solution, it ticks all the right boxes.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re new to Plex and just want a NAS that lets you stream your media collection, you should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a>. The NAS has two drive bays, is powered by Intel&apos;s reliable Celeron J4125 platform, and comes with 2GB of RAM as standard. You get dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, two USB ports, and the design has good passive ventilation along with a 92mm fan at the back that manages thermals well.</p><p>That said, the hardware isn&apos;t the best you&apos;ll find in this segment; you don&apos;t get any M.2 drives, and you miss out on multi-Gigabit connectivity. But it&apos;s all about achieving the right balance, and the DS224+ definitely manages to do that. Although it misses out on a few things, there are no issues with performance, and for most users, Gigabit Ethernet is still more than adequate.</p><p>Where the DS224+ truly shines is its ability as a Plex media server. The NAS has a native Plex client, and configuring it takes less than five minutes. And as it uses an Intel platform, you get hardware-based transcoding — if you have Plex Pass. Most users don&apos;t need to transcode content, but if you want to share your Plex library and have devices that can&apos;t play back the content natively, it comes in handy.</p><p>I tested Plex extensively on the DS224+, and the NAS does a terrific job playing back high bitrate 4K content without any issues. And if you need the feature, it holds up well with transcodes as well. Another standout feature is the software itself; the DS224+ runs DiskStation Manager (DSM), and it has an extensive suite of utilities that make a genuine difference — you won&apos;t get this level of polish with other brands. DSM also has useful mobile apps that let you access your data on the go.</p><p>Ultimately, the DS224+ is a powerful server that&apos;s a great choice for Plex, and you can&apos;t really go wrong with the NAS.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds423-plus-review">DiskStation DS423+</a> is nearly identical to the DS224+, and the key difference between the two is that the DS423+ has four drive bays, giving you the ability to house twice as much storage. You also get two M.2 slots on the underside, and that lets you use NVMe SSDs in addition to traditional hard drives.</p><p>The rest of the features are identical; the DS423+ uses the same Intel Celeron J4125 as the DS224+, you get 2GB of RAM, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and two USB ports. As it is a larger unit, there are two 92mm fans at the back. I would have liked to see at least one multi-Gigabit port — a lot of other 4-bay servers offer it as standard these days — but other than that, the hardware is pretty decent.</p><p>As the DS423+ uses the same Intel platform, it handles Plex in much the same fashion as the DS224+. I didn&apos;t run into any issues playing back 4K content, and transcoding worked reliably as well. And just like the DS224+, you get the same great feature-set within DSM, allowing you to do so much more in addition to Plex streaming.</p><p>If you like the look of the DS224+ but need M.2 slots or additional drive bays, the DiskStation DS423+ is the ideal choice.</p>

<p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T has the best hardware in its category, and the 2-bay NAS has everything you need in a Plex server. The Intel Celeron J5105 is outstanding in daily use, you get 4GB of RAM, four M.2 slots in total, and dual 2.5GbE ports as standard. Interestingly, there&apos;s also an HDMI port at the back that lets you connect the NAS straight to your TV — a good option if you don&apos;t want to stream over the network.</p><p>Basically, the AS5402T doesn&apos;t have anything missing on the hardware front, so if you want multi-Gigabit connectivity and plenty of M.2 bays, the NAS is the way to go. The Celeron J5105 is great at transcodes too, so if you have Plex Pass, you can use hardware transcodes on devices that can&apos;t natively play back content.</p><p>The ADM software is decent too; you get a native Plex client, containerization, and a ton of useful utilities. The interface isn&apos;t quite as polished as DSM, and the mobile clients aren&apos;t as refined, but on the whole, ASUSTOR is doing a good job on the software side of things as well.</p><p>The AS5402T has better hardware than other 2-bay servers in this segment, so if that is your main consideration, you&apos;ll find plenty to like with the NAS.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve used enough TerraMaster NAS servers over the years to know that the brand prioritizes value, and that&apos;s no different with the F4-423.

It has a native Plex client, handles 4K content and transcodes without any issues, and the HDMI port lets you connect the NAS to your TV.</p><p>TerraMaster&apos;s biggest limitation in the past was the software, but that has changed in recent months with the introduction of TOS6. The new interface is cleaner and easier to use, and it has useful features. It still doesn&apos;t quite have the same level of polish as other vendors, and the mobile utilities are lacking. That said, you get the basics, and it&apos;s clear that TerraMaster is intent on tweaking its software.</p><p>So if you want the best bargain out of a Plex server, just get the F4-423.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS9xx series has always been a best-seller, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> maintains that streak. The NAS now uses Ryzen hardware in lieu of Intel, and because it doesn&apos;t have an integrated GPU, you lose out on Plex transcoding. So if you absolutely need to use the feature, you should consider the DS423+ instead.</p><p>Although most models in this category have 2.5GbE or even 10GbE, the DS923+ is limited to dual Gigabit Ethernet ports. If you want multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to pay another $100 to get a 10GbE network card and slot it into the NAS. So why should you consider the NAS? For starters, the AMD hardware is outstanding; it is noticeably faster in daily use, and that makes the DS923+ better-suited for demanding tasks.</p><p>And while you don&apos;t get Plex transcodes, the DS923+ is a standout choice for media streaming. It handles Plex playback without any issues whatsoever, doing a great job with high bitrate content across two devices at the same time. The DSM software is the best around, and because you get 4GB of RAM, you can run virtualization tasks and containers with relative ease.</p><p>There&apos;s also the ability to add more drive bays down the line; the DS923+ has four bays as standard, but you can buy an external housing like the DX517 and connect up to five additional drives to the NAS. It&apos;s this extensibility combined with the powerful hardware that gives it an edge over servers like the DS423+.</p>

<p>The DiskStation DS223j doesn&apos;t have powerful hardware, but it still manages to do a great job when it comes to Plex. You can install the native Plex client and stream content to devices on your home network, but the Realtek hardware doesn&apos;t have transcoding.</p><p>You may think 1GB of RAM is too low, but it&apos;s more than adequate for the DSM software, and it is double that its predecessor — the DiskStation DS220j — offered. As it is an entry-level model, the DS223j doesn&apos;t have any upgradability; the RAM modules are soldered, and you can&apos;t add multi-Gigabit connectivity.</p><p>That said, if you just need an affordable NAS server to store your media collection and back up photos and videos, the DS223j is a good choice to consider. The DSM software is easily the best in this category, and while you don&apos;t get the more advanced features, all the basics are covered.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-plex-such-a-good-media-server-2">What makes Plex such a good media server?</h2>
<p>As a high-level overview, Plex is a free media server utility that catalogs your media collection and makes it available for streaming on all of the connected devices in your home. </p><p>It is often considered to be the best media server around, and there are a few reasons for that. First up is the fact that it&apos;s available on just about any ecosystem: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Android TV, all streaming dongles, and most smart TVs. Basically, you can install Plex on all the devices you own. </p><p>Plex also does a great job with media organization. It sorts your music, movies, and TV shows into relevant categories, and adds high-resolution album art, covers, trailers, and metadata automatically. Also, as the content is streamed locally within your home network, it doesn&apos;t count toward your internet bandwidth costs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-plex-transcode-and-how-does-it-work-2">What is Plex transcode, and how does it work?</h2>
<p>The biggest reason for Plex&apos;s dominance has to do with the fact that it can play any file on any device. Plex has a powerful transcoding service baked in, and if you have the paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex-pass">Plex Pass</a> plan, you can unlock hardware acceleration — that makes a huge difference for transcoding 4K files.</p><p>Even if you&apos;re using an iPhone, iPad, Amazon tablet, an older smart TV, or an Android phone, you can confidently play your media library on any device without any issues. Plex handles transcodes automatically, so there&apos;s no intervention needed from your side — and that makes it a fantastic media streaming service. </p><p>Plex streaming generally falls into three categories:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Direct Play</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is when the Plex client (your TV or streaming box) natively handles the video container and just streams the file as-is without any issues. This uses minimal resources. </li><li><strong>Direct Stream</strong>: In this scenario, the client device you're using can play the video and audio streams, but does not work with the container (like .mkv or .m4a), so Plex will copy those streams to a compatible container and send it to your device. This mode uses a few resources, but it isn't demanding on the server. </li><li><strong>Transcode</strong>: This is where things get interesting. Plex will transcode files when a client device is unable to play the video or audio streams at all. This is due to the lack of audio or video codecs (like H.265, HEVC, H.264) on the client device, and in this situation Plex converts the video to a file that can be played on the device. This is the most CPU-intensive option and needs a powerful NAS. </li></ul>
<h2 id="what-should-you-look-for-in-a-plex-nas-2">What should you look for in a Plex NAS?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zwiFAa2FkXip8r9xKenRHi" name="synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-14.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS224+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zwiFAa2FkXip8r9xKenRHi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things you&apos;ll need to pay attention to if you&apos;re interested in a Plex NAS. </p>
<h2 id="cpu-2">CPU</h2>
<p>This is a key consideration when choosing a Plex NAS, as you&apos;ll need a powerful CPU for transcodes. Most servers over $400 meet this criteria, but as a general rule, you&apos;ll need a recent Intel chipset — Celeron models are good for home use, but if you&apos;re sharing your Plex server with friends and family and need more bandwidth, you&apos;ll need to look at servers featuring Intel Core hardware.</p><p>While AMD has made inroads into the NAS category , Intel is still king here. If you want the ability to transcode 4K content in Plex, you&apos;ll need to buy a NAS server with a recent-gen Intel Celeron or Core CPU.</p>
<h2 id="memory-2">Memory</h2>
<p>Basically, you&apos;ll need a decent amount of RAM to make sure there are no bottlenecks. Plex isn&apos;t memory-intensive, but if you have a lot of other services running on the NAS, it could become an issue. Generally, 2GB of RAM is the bare minimum in this category, and if you&apos;re looking to run a lot of services, I&apos;d suggest getting an 8GB memory module and slotting it in. </p><p>Most NAS servers let you upgrade the RAM with ease, so you shouldn&apos;t have any issues slotting in 8GB or more memory within the server should you need it. </p>
<h2 id="connectivity-2">Connectivity</h2>
<p>Most NAS servers have two Gigabit ports as standard, and that should be adequate for home use. But if you&apos;re sharing your Plex instance and need additional bandwidth, you should look at a server with 2.5GbE or even 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. </p><p>That said, if you switch to a NAS with multi-Gigabit connectivity, you&apos;ll need to simultaneously upgrade your switch and router to take full advantage of the additional bandwidth on offer. It isn&apos;t as costly as it used to be to switch to a 10GbE home network, but you&apos;ll have to take those additional costs into consideration. For now, Gigabit Ethernet is more than adequate for handling a few Plex 4K streams without any issues. </p><p>Some NAS models feature an HDMI port that lets you connect the server to a TV or monitor. This is useful as you can then play the media stored on the NAS directly without having to stream it wirelessly on your home network. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-best-plex-server-2">What is the best Plex server?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of options if you want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best NAS for home</a> use, and you can choose between entry-level picks that have a single or two drive bays, and there are four-bay models that are designed to last. </p><p>But if you&apos;re in the best Plex server, there are a few additional points to consider. For one thing, Plex transcoding is a very CPU-intensive task, so you will need to look at NAS enclosures that have a powerful chipset. Thankfully, the biggest NAS manufacturers — Synology, QNAP, and ASUSTOR — deliver models catered for Plex media streaming. </p><p>Synology&apos;s DiskStation DS224+ illustrates this point perfectly — the two-bay NAS server features the Intel Celeron J4125 and handles Plex native streaming as well as transcoding without breaking a sweat. </p><p>If you want a little more room, the DiskStation DS423+ has four bays that can hold up to 64TB of storage in total. The rest of the features as the same as the DS224+, but you get two M.2 slots. </p>

<p>Right now, if you&apos;re looking to pick up a NAS for Plex streaming, the best option is the DiskStation DS224+. The upgraded internal hardware makes it an enticing model in this category, and with two Gigabit Ethernet ports and robust software features, the NAS has all the basics covered.</p><p>ASUSTOR&apos;s AS5402T is a really good contender as well, and it delivers the best hardware package in this segment. </p>
<h2 id="our-testing-methodology-for-the-best-plex-server-2">Our testing methodology for the best Plex server</h2>
<p>There are a few things I consider when deciding what NAS servers to recommend for Plex streaming. First up is the CPU; I run a few synthetic tests to determine its performance potential, looking at single and multi-core scores. </p><p>Then I set up a native Plex install on the NAS and run multimedia streaming tests to see resource usage in real-world scenarios when streaming 720p, 1080p, and 4K files on the local network. </p><p>I also evaluate transcoding potential by streaming a 4K file to a device that doesn&apos;t handle the native container — this is a great way to determine if the NAS can handle on-the-fly transcodes for 4K files with high bitrates. </p><p>Finally, I look at sequential read/write potential by transferring an image library containing over 5,000 files (all under 1MB), and a dozen media files over 1GB in size. </p><p>Ultimately, the best Plex server needs to be able to stream your local media library to all devices on your home network (and over the internet), and it should be able to do so consistently for several years. </p><p>All of the NAS models highlighted in this post can do just that, so if you&apos;re looking to get your hands on a Plex NAS server, you can go ahead and pick up any models in this list with confidence. </p>

<ul><li>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 has reportedly appeared in two databases as Google proceeded with its charging case certification.</li><li>The listings show the case may feature a 650mAh battery capacity, which would be a 30mAh increase from 2022.</li><li>Little else is known about the buds, but there are specs from its original iteration to look back on.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information about Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel Buds Pro model has appeared following its certification appearance overseas.</p><p>The assumed charging case for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was spotted on UL Demko (Denmark) and Safety Korea, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-battery-leaked/">91Mobiles</a>. Regarding the former, the case&apos;s listing shows model number GH8TQ, with the database stating it features a rechargeable Li-ion battery.</p><p>What&apos;s important here is that the charging case has been given a battery capacity of 650mAh.</p><p>A photo of the Pixel Buds Pro 2&apos;s battery for its charging case appeared on Safety Korea&apos;s listing. However, further images of the device (such as its case) weren&apos;t spotted in the database as Google continued the certification process.</p><p>More information regarding the Buds wasn&apos;t detailed in the assumed Pro 2 listing, either. The publication speculates that the upcoming device could launch sometime after I/O 2024 in May, which would (ideally) feature its official launch. Rumors add that the device could be delayed and withheld until Google&apos;s fall launch of the Pixel 9 series.</p>

<p>While rumors of the new device are limited, we have the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> from 2022 to look back on. The original device featured a charging case with a 620mAh battery, which means the rumors could spell a 30mAh boost if true. As the publication notes, the Buds Pro could deliver 31 extra hours of battery. The increase might see that number increased slightly, but we&apos;ll have to wait to be sure.</p><p>Moreover, the original Buds Pro could last for around 11 hours with ANC disabled and seven with it on. If Google is looking to boost its case&apos;s battery, then perhaps there&apos;s more in store for the buds, too.</p><p>Also, with Google&apos;s newfound endeavors with AI, perhaps we&apos;re looking at a chance for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to impact the Buds Pro 2.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Google is preparing to bring for I/O 2024. It was rumored that the company&apos;s fall event could be packed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">upcoming Fold successor</a> could shift toward that later section of the year. If Google does delay its Buds Pro 2 launch until the fall, then we might see even more excitement.</p>

<ul><li>Digging through Android's code seemingly unearthed Google's work at implementing a new satellite SOS UI.</li><li>The UI will guide users through a setup process as they must align their phones with a satellite to begin communicating with emergency services.</li><li>Google is preparing to bring satellite connectivity capabilities with Android 15 and with its upcoming Tensor G4 chip for the Pixel 9.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some digging into Google&apos;s code seems to have unearthed an alleged first look at how users will get its Android satellite connectivity to work.</p><p>According to Google News <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4004">on Telegram</a>, users will have to keep their phones in line with satellites floating in low orbit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/pixel_9s_satellite_sos_interface_is_in_the_works_heres_what_it_looks_like_now-news-62447.php">GSMArena</a>). During setup, the code shows that users will be prompted to "get a clear view of the sky" by avoiding obstructions like buildings, trees, and mountains. </p><p>Once done, users will be given a UI page with a large circle in its center. Its purpose is to aid users in locating a satellite in their vicinity. A stronger connection will be obtained by ensuring you&apos;re facing the satellite straight on, meaning it&apos;s in the center of the radius.</p><p>The post adds that users can minimize this SOS page when connected to continue texting emergency services or family members. Android will turn the page into a floating display on a device&apos;s homepage, similar to a widget. If minimized, users will continue to ensure the satellite is properly aligned with their phone.</p><p>Google News states the new SOS UI was spotted in Android&apos;s Adaptive Connectivity Services app. Currently, it&apos;s not a page users can access, as it&apos;s still in the works.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve known for a while that Google is preparing to bring satellite connectivity via Android 15, and the software&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second developer preview</a> shared more. The preview highlighted the company&apos;s continued work at implementing such connectivity for the next major OS launch later this year. Apps in Android 15 will have the ability to state whether or not a user is connected to a satellite.</p><p>Additionally, Google is adding support for SMS/MMS and RCS chats when connected to a satellite.</p><p>More importantly, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">was spotted yesterday</a> (Apr. 15) that Google&apos;s upcoming Tensor G4 chip for the Pixel 9 will utilize a new Samsung modem. The modem was stated to support 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN) for satellite connectivity capabilities with the new flagship series.</p><p>Android 15 recently achieved its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a>, meaning we&apos;re right on schedule regarding Google&apos;s timeframe for its launch, likely this fall.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp introduces chat filters to allow users to quickly view unread messages or group chats without scrolling through numerous conversations.</li><li>These filters will appear at the top of the chat list, offering options like All, Unread, and Groups.</li><li>The filters will be gradually rolled out to users, with availability expected within the next few weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-tests-chat-filtersagain">new chat filters</a> meant to help you see just unread messages or all your groups in a snap, removing the need to scroll through tons of chats to find them.</p><p>The new filters will pop up right at the top of your chat list, with options like <em>All</em>, <em>Unread</em>, and <em>Groups</em>. When you open the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, you&apos;ll start with the "All" filter, which gives you a view of all your messages. Switch to "Unread" to see only those messages you haven&apos;t checked out yet or marked as unread.</p><p>These filters are even easier to use than the hidden search bar filter for unread messages. If you&apos;re unaware, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> lets you peek at unread messages through a filter in the search bar. But these new filters make it even easier to find that option when you need it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Groups" filter has been a hot request, as per WhatsApp. This feature gathers up all your group chats in one spot, so you can sift through your group messages without any hassle. Plus, it&apos;ll display subgroups of communities for you.</p><p>Before, low-activity groups could easily get lost in the sea of chats. But now, with the Groups filter, you&apos;ll have a much better shot at finding them in the crowd.</p>

<p>"We believe filters will make it easier for people to stay organized and find their most important conversations and help navigate through messages more efficiently," WhatsApp said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/find-messages-faster-with-chat-filters" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "We’ll continue to build more options to help you focus on what matters most."</p><p>The filters are hitting your chats starting today, and everyone will get them over the next few weeks.</p><p>WhatsApp&apos;s been on a roll with new features. In addition to the filters coming to your chat list, the service added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-adds-search-by-date-feature-for-android">another search feature last month for Android users</a>: searching by date. Now, you can finally pinpoint messages effortlessly based on when they were sent instead of endlessly scrolling for that one message.</p><p>And here&apos;s a fun fact: this feature is already up and running on iOS, Mac desktop, and WhatsApp Web.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus might be gearing up to release a new foldable phone that could rival the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, boasting a zoom lens and macro camera.</li><li>A leaker says camera upgrades expected in OPPO's upcoming foldable may carry over to OnePlus, hinting at a similar model with a telephoto camera.</li><li>While flip phones excel in portability, their camera capabilities are usually lacking, but the rumored inclusion of a telephoto lens in the OnePlus Flip could change the game.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus already has a book-style foldable phone, but a new rumor says its next one might be a Galaxy Z Flip contender, and this one could even have a zoom lens, which is rare for foldable phones.</p><p>A leaker who goes by the handle Smart Pikachu on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/O9GOwe7lS" target="_blank">Weibo</a> says that OnePlus might drop a second foldable phone this year. But it will supposedly be different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and will instead flip open like Motorola&apos;s Razr models and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip line. The tipster adds that it will pack a telephoto and macro rear camera (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-flip-foldable-leak-3434110/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Foldables are seriously turning heads in the smartphone world these days, even though there aren&apos;t heaps to pick from just yet. It&apos;s no wonder every phone maker wants a piece of the action.</p><p>Flip phones fold in half for ultimate portability, unlike those giant slabs everyone else uses. Plus, they are usually more affordable than book-style foldables, putting them right up there with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> in terms of price.</p><p>But their cameras often leave something to be desired. Usually, they&apos;re rocking a dual-camera setup, but the telephoto lens is often the one that&apos;s missing. However, if this rumor about the OnePlus Flip is true, it could be a game-changer for flip phones by bringing a telephoto lens to the game.</p><p>The tipster is hinting that these camera upgrades will debut on OPPO&apos;s upcoming compact foldable, and it&apos;s likely they&apos;ll trickle down to a similar OnePlus model, maybe with a slight tweak or rebranding.</p><p>Even though it&apos;s not official yet, it&apos;s not exactly a wild guess. The OnePlus Open was basically a twin of the OPPO Find N3. If OnePlus rolls out a flip phone resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a>, it wouldn&apos;t be a shocker.</p><p>Plus, having a flip phone with a telephoto camera would be pretty unique since hardly any flip foldables offer this feature right now. In fact, the only one you can actually buy right now with a telephoto camera is the Find N3 Flip. So, if this rumor is accurate, the OnePlus Flip could be a real standout.</p>

The term "Google Pay" still exists for making contactless NFC payments in stores, but you use the Google Wallet app for those transactions.</p><p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay app is shutting down</a> later this year, you&apos;re probably curious which Pay features will transfer over to Wallet. You may also have heard that Google Wallet supports features like driver&apos;s licenses, tickets, and medical info, and you may want to know how to access these.</p><p>Our in-depth Google Wallet guide will break down its history, list of key features, recent news and updates, and everything else you need to know!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-summarized"><span>Google Wallet, summarized</span></h2>
<p>The original Google Wallet launched in 2011 as a Nexus phone exclusive for contactless credit card payments at specific locations. A lack of NFC-enabled phones, insufficient retail partnerships, and little consumer interest sunk the initiative.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-rolling-out-starting-today">Android Pay</a> took Wallet&apos;s place in 2015 as a payment system with much more business support and infrastructure, while Wallet scaled down into a peer-to-peer payment system. </p><p>By 2018, both services had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-and-google-wallet-join-together-form-google-pay">consolidated</a> into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> brand, a single app for both tap-to-pay and sending money to friends, and Google Wallet ceased to be. Over time, Google Pay added boarding passes, event confirmations, transit balances, and other tools that weren&apos;t strictly "payments."</p><p>Google&apos;s love of renaming services for a marketing boost came full circle in July 2022, when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-launch">rebranded its payment service to Google Wallet</a> once again. Google Pay persisted as a peer-to-peer payment app with its wallet-like features removed, but it will shut down on June 4, 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN" name="Google-Wallet-screenshot-3.jpeg" alt="Google Wallet example animation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet will continue to support "Google Pay" payments in stores worldwide. It <strong>won&apos;t</strong> enable P2P payments like the original Pay app, however, and your current Google Pay balance will only be transferrable through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/home" target="_blank">website</a> once the Pay mobile app shuts down.</p><p>Google Wallet supports a variety of banks and credit cards across over 80 countries. It also supports a variety of other passes, IDs, and stored information that we&apos;ll break down in the next section.</p><p>Generally speaking, Google Wallet pulls information from other Google apps on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. So, for example, if you receive an email on Gmail with a delayed flight time, it&apos;ll notify you and change the stored boarding pass information.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-can-you-store-in-google-wallet"><span>What can you store in Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2171px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg" name="Google-Wallet-app-examples.jpg" alt="Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2171" height="1221" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First and foremost, you can deposit <strong>credit</strong> and <strong>debit cards</strong> in Google Wallet. Most banks and cards are compatible, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">has added</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">dozens of new banks</a> in 2024 to fill out the list before Google Pay&apos;s shutdown. You can ensure your bank is included by checking the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/7454247?hl=en&ref_topic=7625138" target="_blank">supported contactless payments</a> sorted by country.</p><p>As a sidenote, we have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lock-down-google-wallet-cards">how to lock down your Google Wallet cards</a> if your phone is stolen, so that the thief can&apos;t use tap-to-pay with those stored cards.</p><p>You can add your <strong>loyalty </strong>or <strong>membership cards</strong>, then tap your phone or watch to apply discounts or balances, or even pay directly for items. Check if your loyalty card is eligible by tapping <strong>Add to Wallet > Loyalty card </strong>and entering the program name.</p><p>Plus, you can keep your <strong>boarding passes</strong> and <strong>event tickets</strong> in Google Wallet, so entering a plane or stadium is as simple as pulling them up and tapping your phone. In March 2024, Google updated Wallet so that Gmail confirmation emails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">automatically export passes to Wallet</a>, saving you the trouble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC" name="Google-Wallet-Add-Transit-Card.jpeg" alt="Adding public transit card to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet also hosts <strong>transit cards</strong> and <strong>parking passes</strong>, though once again, there is no guarantee that your local public transit or parking system will support Google Wallet without checking. Currently, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Toronto are the only cities to support Google Wallet transit passes or payments.</p><p>You may add <strong>COVID-19 vaccine passports</strong> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-covid-vaccine-cards-google-wallet">other medical info</a> to Google Wallet as well.</p><p>Other Google Wallet functions include <strong>digital car keys</strong>, <strong>corporate office passes</strong>, and <strong>hotel keys</strong>. Digital car keys require a relatively recent phone running Android 12 or later, and not all cars will support them. As for corporate badges, only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/14085932?hl=en&ref_topic=11925097&sjid=11940236237620777137-NA" target="_blank">10 countries</a> support corporate passes today, and your employer must buy into the program.</p><p>Google&apos;s biggest challenge, however, will be to enable <strong>digital driver&apos;s licenses</strong> or <strong>student IDs</strong>. Certain American states have begun to support digital IDs, but it&apos;s extremely limited at the moment.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-i-store-my-driver-s-license-in-google-wallet"><span>Can I store my driver's license in Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVy8MWzXVKBSjhv5khk5Ph" name="Google-IO-2022-digital-driver's-license-graphic.png" alt="Digital Driver's license graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVy8MWzXVKBSjhv5khk5Ph.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During Google I/O 2022, VP of Product Management Sameer Samat announced on stage that "we&apos;re working with states here in the U.S. and governments around the world to bring digital IDs to wallet later this year, starting with driver&apos;s licenses."</p><p>That statement turned out to be a bit optimistic: The ID program did launch in Maryland by the end of 2022, but Google took until October 2023 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-ids-for-three-more-us-states">add digital ID support for Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia residents</a>.</p><p>Dong Min Kim, Google&apos;s director of product management for Google Wallet, did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">promise in January</a> that "Digital ID will be a cornerstone for us in the next year" and that more states&apos; IDs will come to Wallet in the coming months. But we&apos;ve yet to hear anything since, and there are regulatory hurdles to making this happen.</p><p>To add a driver&apos;s license to Google Wallet, you&apos;ll need an Android phone (version 8 or higher) with Bluetooth and Nearby Devices active and a screen lock protecting it.</p><p>With all of those prerequisites fulfilled, you can simply open the Wallet app and tap <strong>Add to Wallet > ID card</strong>. You&apos;ll then have to take photos of the front and back of your ID, then record a short video of yourself to submit for verification. At that point, you should be able to use your ID in lieu of a physical card at participating airports.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-student-id-google-wallet">adding a student ID to Google Wallet</a>, we have a guide for that as well, but it will once again depend on whether or not your school supports the feature.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-banks"><span>Google Wallet: Banks</span></h2>
<p>We can&apos;t possibly include the full list of Google Wallet banks here, so we&apos;ll link you to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059326?hl=en&co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS&sjid=13323444051548168082-NA" target="_blank"><strong>Google Support page</strong></a><strong> </strong>that has a dropdown menu linking to each country&apos;s list of banks.</p><p>Just for the United States alone, the list of "other participating banks" appears to have <strong>thousands of options</strong>. Once you&apos;ve selected a bank in Google Wallet, you&apos;ll most likely need to log into the bank&apos;s website, or enter a PIN or authorization code.</p><p>You can also choose to make Paypal a payment method in Google Wallet, though only in the United States and Germany.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-which-countries-support-google-wallet"><span>Which countries support Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<p>Currently, Google Wallet has replaced Google Pay in the following 80 countries, listed below:</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-vs-competing-payment-apps"><span>Google Wallet vs. competing payment apps</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ" name="Samsung-Wallet-close-up.jpg" alt="Samsung Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android users, specifically Samsung phone owners, have two main choices for their payment app: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Google Wallet or Samsung Wallet</a>. The latter launched around the same time as Google Wallet, combining Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass into one service. Sound familiar?</p><p>Like Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet collects your digital payment cards, boarding passes, vaccination cards, and digital car keys, with the eventual goal of adding IDs and licenses.</p><p><em>Unlike</em> Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet stores passwords, a remnant of the feature on Samsung Pass. Plus, anyone invested in crypto can "monitor their digital asset portfolio by checking the value of their cryptocurrencies across various exchanges" within Wallet.</p><p>Samsung Wallet is available now, but only on Samsung phones via the Galaxy Store — whereas Google Wallet is available on all Android phones via the Play Store — and only 21 countries, well short of Google&apos;s list.</p><p>Looking beyond the Android phone ecosystem, we also have a general guide on how the five main payment systems — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-pay-vs-amazon-pay-vs-google-pay-vs-samsung-pay">Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Meta Pay, and Amazon Pay</a> — compare to one another. </p><p>To briefly summarize, Google and Apple have the most robust features and widespread presence for both mobile and web payments. Amazon Pay is more limited but takes very little setup if you have a Prime account, while Meta Pay is most useful for frequent Facebook Marketplace users.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-new-with-google-wallet"><span>What's new with Google Wallet?</span></h2>

<p>The biggest recent change to Google Wallet was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-qr-barcode-pass-rollout">photo function</a>, which lets you take a photo of a physical pass and have that data auto-transcribed into Wallet, rather than making you type it out yourself.</p><p>Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-apple-pass-more-user-support">added support for Apple Wallet files</a> in early 2024, though the rollout is still ongoing. People have noticed glitches, since ".pkpass" file expect you to be using an iPhone, but those glitches should be fixed over time.</p><p>Another controversy arose when Google Wallet began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">requiring you to verify your identity</a> before making contactless payments in certain countries. While some countries already required this, others let you make payments indefinitely so long as they weren&apos;t above a certain threshold.</p><p>Google later created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-verification-settings-to-balance-security-and-convenience">"Verification Settings"</a> for Wallet, letting you decide in advance whether to require authentication before certain actions, such as using Wallet as a transit pass.</p><p>In late 2023, there was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-vulnerability-exposes-card-information">Google Wallet vulnerability</a> that exposed credit card information via a standard NFC reader. This glitch was eventually fixed.</p>

Basically, any Wear OS watch is going to support the feature, since it&apos;s a Google operating system.

Sometimes, internet connection can be spotty or fail altogether, and saving them for offline viewing will give you a library of content to pass the time.</p><p>Whether you&apos;re watching videos on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> or not, downloading YouTube videos is quick and easy. Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/streaming-platforms-prioritize-content-over-ui">streaming services aren&apos;t getting better</a>, they still want you to pay for more content. But finding something to watch when your internet isn&apos;t working can be frustrating, so it&apos;s always a good idea to have a backup plan and videos to watch.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To download YouTube videos, you must have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> subscription.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-youtube-videos-to-watch-offline-2">How to download YouTube videos to watch offline</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube app </strong>on your device.</p><p>2. Find and <strong>open the video</strong> you want to download.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Download </strong>in the menu that appears below the video.</p><p>4. If you don&apos;t have YouTube Premium, you&apos;ll see a <strong>prompt to get it</strong>, which is required to download videos. You can start the free trial or select<strong> Not now </strong>if you don&apos;t wish to proceed. If you give the Premium version a chance, you&apos;ll see a Subscribe button with information letting you know the day the free trial ends and how much you&apos;ll be charged after. YouTube will remind you that your free trial is ending seven days before the deadline.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8" name="download youtube videos 1-3.jpg" alt="youtube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. If you have YouTube Premium, you’ll be given <strong>options for the resolution to download the video</strong>. Naturally, the higher the resolution, the more space the download will take up on your device and the potentially longer the video will take to download (though with good Wi-Fi or a solid cellular connection, this likely won’t be an issue). Choose the desired resolution and select <strong>Download</strong>.</p><p>6. Once selected, the <strong>video will automatically begin downloading,</strong> and you’ll see the download process as the arrow lights up.</p><p>7. Once downloaded, the download button will show <strong>Downloaded</strong> with a white checkmark beside it.</p>

<p>As noted, to download YouTube videos for offline viewing, like the top trending videos to watch during your commutes or a walk down memory lane with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">YouTube Music 2023</a>, you need a YouTube Premium subscription, which is $13.99 a month. However, you can try it out for one month for free before committing.</p><p>Once downloaded, you have up to 29 days to watch the downloaded video. If you haven’t gotten around to watching yet after the timeframe expires, you can reconnect to a mobile or Wi-Fi network and download the video again (if it’s still available for offline viewing). If it is no longer available, it will automatically be removed from your device the next time you sync it. If any changes have been made to the video, they will be applied when you&apos;re online.</p><p>Once a YouTube video is downloaded, it resides locally on your device. That means it’s taking up valuable space, so it’s a good idea to delete it once you are done watching and no longer need it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-delete-downloaded-youtube-videos-2">How to delete downloaded YouTube videos</h2>
<p>Deleting the video is simple:</p><p>1. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Swipe up and choose <strong>Downloads</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>dots to the side</strong> of the video.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Delete</strong> from downloads at the bottom.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-smart-downloads-on-youtube-2">What are Smart Downloads on YouTube?</h2>
<p>Smart Downloads are recommended videos that YouTube automatically downloads so you always have something to watch. The downloads will stop when you&apos;re low on storage or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/wifi-keeps-disconnecting-and-reconnecting.1064087/">disconnected from Wi-Fi</a>. Based on your viewing habits, YouTube will automatically download videos you might like.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-youtube-smart-downloads-work-2">How does YouTube Smart Downloads work?</h2>
<p>If the videos are not downloading, you can enable the feature by:</p><p>1. Tapping your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>cogwheel</strong> at the top right.</p><p>3. Go to <strong>Backgrounds & downloads</strong>.</p><p>4. Look for and <strong>toggle on</strong> the <strong>Smart downloads</strong> option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU" name="Turn-off-smart-download-YouTube.jpg" alt="Steps to turn on or off Smart Downloads on YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As long as you&apos;re here, you can also make other adjustments, such as only downloading over Wi-Fi, adjusting how Playback works, and adjusting how much storage Smart downloads takes up and the quality of Smart downloads. You&apos;ll also see options for Delete all downloads and how much storage you have left. When you adjust the storage space the feature takes up by using the slider; you&apos;ll also see how much video time that is. For example, you set the storage limit to 1.5GB, and besides it, you&apos;ll see that that equals 11 hours of videos.</p>
<h2 id="keep-downloading-2">Keep downloading</h2>
<p>It&apos;s easy to take the Internet for granted and think it&apos;ll always be there, but it&apos;s best to be prepared and have some YouTube videos to watch. If you&apos;re going to watch YouTube on your computer, get ready for a change since YouTube is testing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-might-change-the-location-of-video-titles-and-comments">redesigned video player on the web</a>.</p><p>Since YouTube Music is also part of the package, remember that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-for-android-and-ios-gain-activity-feed">rolling out a new Activity feed for Android and iOS</a>.
