<ul><li>Google is reportedly gearing up to launch a new Chromecast with Google TV 4K, which would replace the almost four-year-old model sold today.</li><li>The company may address the streaming dongle's performance woes with a new chip offering more RAM or storage and a potential OS upgrade.</li><li>Additionally, Google appears to be working on a new Chromecast Voice Remote that could ship with the upcoming Chromecast with Google TV 4K refresh.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The streaming stick market has become a race to provide the best specs at the lowest prices, especially in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> sector of the market. Google&apos;s first Chromecast with Google TV 4K offered an Android-based OS, intuitive remote, and 4K resolution for just $50 when it was first released in 2020. Now that it&apos;s going on four years old, the Chromecast with Google TV 4K is showing its age and could really use an upgrade. That might be finally coming soon.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/22/new-4k-chromecast-google-tv/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, a source confirmed that a Chromecast with Google TV 4K successor is in development, and the company is gearing up for a launch. Prior reports indicated that Google was working on an Android-equipped Chromecast device, but it wasn&apos;t known for certain what functionality or price point it would target. The upcoming streaming dongle will be the first from Google since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV HD</a> was updated back in 2022. </p><p>While it&apos;s likely the next-generation Chromecast with Google TV 4K will include a slew of improvements across the board, a point of focus looks to be the remote. Last year, a brand-new version of the Chromecast Voice Remote was spotted in an Android TV 14 beta. While the graphic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-tv-14-beta">inside the beta Android TV 14 release</a> depicted a remote similar to the current Chromecast Voice remote, there were key differences. Notably, the new remote expected to ship with the Chromecast with Google TV 4K will have more dedicated buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GjUEAuJDetVekTTEamVBoQ" name="chromecast-with-google-tv-plugged-in.jpg" alt="Chromecast with Google TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GjUEAuJDetVekTTEamVBoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The current Chromecast with Google TV 4K still runs Android 12 TV, so the jump to Android 14 TV seems plausible. The operating system upgrade includes a few new software features that would improve usability without any hardware changes. However, it is also reasonable that Google would upgrade the aging chip found within the Chromecast with Google TV 4K that is sold today, which is the Amlogic S905X3. </p><p>This processor isn&apos;t great, featuring just 2GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Processing power isn&apos;t as important on a streaming dongle as it is on something like a smartphone, but RAM and on-device storage still matter. As such, a new chip could go a long way in making the Chromecast with Google TV 4K more enjoyable to use. 9to5Google suspects that the company may go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv-amlogic-x5-chip-revealed">Amlogic S905X5 processor</a>, which is a two-generations-newer chip than the Amlogic S905X3 from four years ago.</p><p>We don&apos;t know exactly when the next-generation 4K streaming dongle from Google will debut, but 9to5Google&apos;s phrasing hints at an imminent release. Though Google I/O is only a few weeks away, it&apos;s unlikely something like a Chromecast with Google TV 4K would be released at the event. </p>

<hr>
<p>A new Pixel 8a leak might have revealed the expected pricing of the mid-range handset, which is likely to debut in May at Google I/O 2024.</p><p>After the Pixel 8a&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-google-pixel-8a-renders-reveal-color-options">recent renders leak</a> showcased the device in all its colorways, the was spotted on a Canadian retail listing by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://passionategeekz.com/exclusive-this-is-how-much-google-pixel-8a-5g-will-cost-you/">PassionateGeekz</a>, revealing possible pricing in both storage variants (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_8a_price_leaks_to_be_pricier_than_the_pixel_7a-news-62534.php">GSMArena</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> bearing 128GB of storage is shown to be priced at CAD 708.99, and the larger 256GB onboard storage variant may be priced at CAD 792.99, roughly equivalent to $518 and $579 in the U.S.</p>

<p>While the listing and translated pricing certainly match the previous rumor indicating that this year&apos;s mid-range device is going to be pricer than its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, it is still unclear whether these new prices are accurate.</p><p>The earlier price rumors indicated that the Pixel 8a would cost around €569.90 and €630, respectively, per a Germain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-higher-price">retail listing</a>, although the latest leak pricing is significantly lower in comparison. Of course, until the phone is launched, it&apos;s recommended that these pricing leaks be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The alleged pricing details follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-spotted-on-uscellular-website">recent USCellular</a> leak, showing the Pixel 8a in a device tutorial. With so many leaks, it seems clear that we can expect the Pixel 8a sooner rather than later as Google gears up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google I/O 2024</a> event in early May. Alongside significant software and AI highlights, we expect to see the Pixel 8a and other hardware announcements at the event.</p><p>As for the specs, the Pixel 8a is expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a>, a 6.1-inch Full HD Plus display, a 64MP primary camera, a 13MP secondary lens, and a 13MP front camera. Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">recent battery listing</a>, the device is also expected to have a bigger battery than the predecessor, featuring a 5000mAh battery capacity.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Samsung support team has acknowledged a recent display issue, which has been seen on older Galaxy phones after a recent update. As a solution to those affected, the company has offered screen replacements for select models.</p><p>Several reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/some-galaxy-phone-screens-are-showing-a-nasty-green-line-after-an-update">emerged</a> citing a display glitch that affected some of the older Galaxy phones after the April update started rolling out, resulting in a green line appearing on displays of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> series, S21 series, and several others in the lot. X user Tarun Vats shared screenshots of the chat with the Samsung support team, and they shared some interesting insights about the issue and the accompanying fix.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung India offers a ONE-TIME FREE SCREEN REPLACEMENT for select models(within 3 years of purchase) experiencing GREEN LINE issue, even if your warranty's expired!Applicable Models: •S20 Series•Note20/Ultra•S21 Series(Excluded FE)•S22 Ultra(SM-S908E)Repost to help pic.twitter.com/t1Au0zthlE<a href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1781921549555241453">April 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>After acknowledging the device flickering issue, Samsung recommends the users visit their nearest service center. As a note, it has further shared that they will fix it for older devices even if they aren&apos;t on warranty provided there is no "physical or water damage."</p><p>As Vats points out, the suggested repair includes a one-time free replacement of the affected screen for select models, comprising the Galaxy S20 series, the Note 20 series including the Ultra, the S21 series excluding the Fan Edition model, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review">S22 Ultra</a> as well. The replacement policy is applicable for these models, and their purchase date should be within three years. </p><p>If you are a Samsung device user from the lot above and facing the issue, it is highly recommended that you visit the nearby service center before April 30, 2024.</p>
<p>That said, other Galaxy owners have also faced the green line problem after installing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">April 2024 security update</a>. They include models like the Galaxy A73, Galaxy M21, M52 5G, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3. While these aren&apos;t mentioned in the applicable device list, handset owners are advised to visit their nearest service center, regardless.</p><p>The display replacement offer from Samsung comes after the following email statement, which was shared with Android Central when asked about the display issue last week:</p><p>"Samsung is committed to providing the best possible mobile experiences and product quality continues to be one of our top priorities. If you&apos;re experiencing a vertical line symptom, please visit an Authorized Samsung Service Center to take appropriate action."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is expected to release the next generation of Galaxy foldables, including the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6, in a few months at a Galaxy Unpacked event.</li><li>Amid a handful of rumors, a new leak from a historically reliable source reveals the smartphones' available colorways and storage configurations. </li><li>Samsung's plans for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 reportedly include tweaked versions of classic colors, as well as familiar storage configurations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;re expecting to see a new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 in a few months, as Samsung often releases <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">next-generation folding phones</a> at a Galaxy Unpacked event held in the summer. It&apos;s unclear how much will change year-to-year, going from the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 to their unreleased successors. However, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss" target="_blank">Ross Young on X (formerly Twitter)</a> revealed the supposed colorways and storage configurations that will be available on Samsung&apos;s newest foldables. </p><p>Samsung sees the Galaxy Z Flip phone as a more accessible way for average consumers to get into foldables, with the Galaxy Z Fold line being reserved for pros and enthusiasts. This is shown through the smartphones&apos; prices, since the Galaxy Z Fold phone usually costs just under double what a Galaxy Z Flip phone costs, but also through colors. The company usually equips the Z Flip version with fun and colorful finishes, whereas Z Fold units play it safer. </p><p>This appears to hold true with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 if the leaked colorways are any indication. Previous reports indicated that the clamshell foldable would come in Light Blue, Light Green, Silver, and Yellow this year. Now, that&apos;s still true, but Young clarifies that the Light Green option will be dubbed "Mint" and the Silver option will be "Silver Shadow." If the Mint color sounds familiar, that&apos;s because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-mint-green">Google added a Mint finish to the Pixel 8 series</a> earlier this year. </p><p>Crafted Black, Peach, and White are said to be "lower-volume colors" for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, according to Young. For the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, the low-volume colors are simply Crafted Black and White — with Peach notably left out. Also seemingly missing this generation is a purple hue, which was previously a staple of Galaxy Z Flip lineups. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-hinge-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The main colors for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be Dark Blue, Light Pink and Silver, as an earlier leak explained. However, this smartphone will also call it Silver Shadow, and refer to Dark Blue as "Navy." While these name-changes are usually just for marketing purposes, they can give us an idea of how new Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 colorways will differ from prior generations. </p><p>Aside from the expected color options, Young reported that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 won&apos;t change anything in terms of storage configurations. The two foldables will be available in 256GB and 512GB variants, with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 adding an extra 1TB tier. These are the exact same configurations available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Samsung is clearly making final preparations for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 in a few months. Just the other day, the company formally acknowledged the smartphones for the first time in a regulatory filing in India.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's Gemini app for Android might soon introduce a feature where users can read responses as they're generated, rather than waiting for the entire response.</li><li>A tipster suggests that Google is working on adding "real-time responses" to Gemini on Android.</li><li>The new feature would display Gemini's response building up gradually, similar to the web version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s Gemini app for Android might soon add a handy feature that will let you read responses as they&apos;re generated rather than waiting for the whole thing.</p><p>According to code sleuth AssembleDebug, who tipped off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/22/gemini-assistant-real-time-responses/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>, Google might be adding a "real-time responses" feature to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app. As the name suggests, it&apos;ll whip up answers to your questions on the spot.</p><p>Currently, when you shoot off your question to Gemini, it analyzes it and then churns out an answer, but you&apos;re stuck twiddling your thumbs until the whole thing is done. It can drag on, especially if the responses are lengthy paragraphs.</p><p>But with the real-time response feature, you&apos;d see Gemini&apos;s response building piece by piece, just like on the web version. Google sums it up nicely: "Responses will show in real-time while in progress."</p><p>Web users already see a cool typing animation as Gemini crafts your answer. If this new find gets rolled out to everyone, you&apos;ll see that same animation jazzing up the Gemini app on Android.</p><p>AssembleDebug managed to switch on the toggle for the feature in Gemini&apos;s settings menu, hinting that it&apos;s just about ready to drop into a stable release, if at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:479px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:156.58%;"><img id="N6cuY4rAoSwUmFxRUTyrVG" name="google-gemini-real-time-response-settings.jpg" alt="Google Gemini real-time response on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6cuY4rAoSwUmFxRUTyrVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="479" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug / PiunikaWeb)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This improvement would definitely be handy, shaving off a few precious seconds by letting you dive into reading right away. It&apos;s especially helpful if you&apos;re only interested in the first few lines or paragraphs of a long response.</p><p>While digging around, AssembleDebug uncovered more than just real-time responses for Gemini. The tipster stumbled upon a new toggle called "Use location from your device" on the same settings page. As it implies, this feature would let users manage Gemini&apos;s access to their location.</p><p>Adding to the mix, PiunikaWeb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-assistant-app-testing-music-streaming-setting">recently reported</a> that Gemini might incorporate your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">favorite music streaming service</a>. It&apos;s a significant development, especially since Gemini is missing out on a few features compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, and this could help bridge the gap.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google released the Android 15 Beta 1.1 update with several bug fixes.</li><li>One fix addresses the NFC bug that rendered the feature useless, making contactless payments via Google Wallet unavailable.</li><li>The update is rolling out now on eligible Pixel smartphones, and those that had issues updating to the beta should now be able to.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">Android 15 Beta</a> was launched a couple of weeks ago, bringing the platform closer to stability than the more developer-focused preview builds. However, the beta brought a nasty bug that effectively disabled NFC operations on many Pixel phones. Now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1cahsd1/android_15_beta_11_patch_now_available/">the latest Android 15 Beta</a>, Google is fixing NFC on Pixels.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 1.1 (<strong>AP31.240322.023</strong>) is rolling out now on eligible Pixel phones, and it brings with it several bug fixes, including a text-clipping issue and a problem with Developer Options. However, one of the more pressing bugs for Pixel owners who opted into the beta is one that effectively disabled NFC. The settings menu for NFC was essentially blank, even as Google introduced the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-default-wallet-option">choose your default Wallet app</a> more easily via the Default apps settings page.</p><p>I previously tried to make a payment at the store when my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> was on the first beta, but I was only met with an odd error on the payment terminal. Fortunately, I had my physical card on me at the time, but that&apos;s not always the case.</p><p>Now, the page is back, and full NFC functionality appears to be working, too. Just to make sure, I went back to the store after installing the latest Android 15 beta, and the payment went through as it normally would.</p>

<p>Aside from fixing NFC, the update also addresses an issue that prevented some users from installing the beta in the first place. Hopefully, anyone hoping to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a> will be able to do so now.</p><p>Here is the full changelog for the new 1.1 patch, per Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed various issues with NFC that interfered with wallet apps and other NFC-dependent system operations.

<p>If you&apos;re interested in installing the beta, you&apos;ll need at least a Pixel 6 (or newer), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>. Keep in mind that it will likely still be filled with bugs as Google irons out the kinks ahead of the scheduled platform stability, which is expected in June.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet might start asking for a PIN on Wear OS watches, potentially making payments less convenient.</li><li>Some Reddit users report having to input a PIN for every payment attempt on their Wear OS watches.</li><li>The PIN prompt seems limited to a few users, suggesting it could be a test, a glitch, or a gradual rollout by Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paying with your Wear OS watch with Google Wallet might get annoying soon, as the app might start asking for a PIN before you can use the speedy payment feature.</p><p>Google Wallet taps into your Android phone and NFC to make payments super easy. It even jumped onto your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">beloved Wear OS watches</a>, so you could pay straight from your wrist. But here comes a security update that might make paying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-3">Wear OS</a> a tad more irritating.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1c8iqw7/gpay_now_needs_to_input_pin_everytime_you_make/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> are reporting about Google Wallet making them enter a PIN every single time they try to pay with their watch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/20/google-wallet-wear-os-pin-pay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). This is different from before, where just a tap did the trick. Unless your device figures out it&apos;s far enough from your body, it&apos;s not going to bug you for a PIN.</p><p>Wear OS smartwatches already make you set up a PIN for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> security, so this new pop-up for every tap seems like a bit much, especially on those tiny screens.</p><p>Since it seems like only a few users are getting hit with this new prompt, there are a couple of things that might be going down, as noted by 9to5. Maybe Google is testing out this feature on a select few watches. Or, it could be a glitch in the app. Or, Google might be slowly introducing the PIN requirement to everyone, one watch at a time.</p><p>Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">made phone users re-verify their Wallet information</a> after a few minutes. So, it&apos;s possible the company is doing something similar for Wear OS, which definitely removes the convenience you get with those speedy wrist taps.</p><p>However, the updated Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059519" target="_blank">support page</a> doesn&apos;t even mention smartwatches, hinting that this new authentication requirement might not be on purpose.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s important to remember that this could be a security improvement Google is testing (even if it is a bit annoying), assuming this new feature is indeed heading to smartwatches.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2023-review">Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)</a> normally comes in at a cheap sticker price, but this discount makes it even cheaper, dropping as low as $49.99 if you activate today. With its aesthetically pleasing design, decent cameras, and more than a full day of battery life, this deal is a no-brainer for those who want a no-frills smartphone.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this phone charges fairly slowly, and it doesn't include NFC. Still, dealing with some of its shortcomings might be easier at this extra-low price.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-128GB-MPCamera-163-94x74-98x8-39/dp/B0C2SWQBMB">Amazon - $149.99</a> | <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-g-5g-gen-2/p?skuId=894">Motorola - $149.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-128gb-unlocked-ink-blue/6540584.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a3070159-46d4-4fdb-adf9-23b269d8594a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>smartphone price point is a major selling point for you; you&apos;ve owned past Motorola phones and enjoyed them.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone with NFC capabilities; you&apos;re willing to spend a few hundred dollars more for a phone with more bells and whistles; slow charging speeds are a deterrent for you.</p><p>The Motorola Moto 5G has all the basics you would expect to find in a smartphone, despite being the 2023 version. Besides lacking NFC capabilities, having limited software updates, and taking quite a while to charge, the Moto 5G still offers excellent speakers, more than a day of battery per charge, and a decent camera.</p><p>While this phone didn&apos;t land a spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> list, the Moto G is super affordable and is a solid pick for anyone trying to get a phone at the lowest sticker price possible. Especially with the additional $100 or $200 off, it&apos;s not hard to justify some of the quirky design choices included with this smartphone.</p>

<p>Ozaif writes:</p><p><em><strong>I recently bought a Redmi Note 12 5G and I have gyroscope and accelerometer issues in games and other things. Is there a solution?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks!</strong></em></p>
<p>This question from Ozaif is very similar to others we&apos;ve received, where something is happening that causes a new(ish) phone to not perform the way we think it should. It&apos;s a thing that can happen to any phone or electronic device, and it&apos;s a wonder that it doesn&apos;t happen more often.</p><p>For starters, don&apos;t get frustrated. At the risk of sounding like an apologist for any phone maker, when you manufacture and sell millions of products, some are going to have hardware faults. There&apos;s no way to test everything on every phone without driving the price even higher than it already is.</p>
<p>The good news is that companies usually resolve these issues quickly. You just need to know where to start. You might think you should contact the company that made your phone but that&apos;s not always the case.</p>
<h2 id="who-did-you-buy-it-from-2">Who did you buy it from?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:881px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG" name="best-buy-sign.jpg" alt="Best Buy store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bVKWwrajQZTCksqxrC3dxG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="881" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Best Buy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can buy a new phone directly from the manufacturer, but it&apos;s also really common to buy through a third party. This could be from a carrier like AT&T or Orange, a retail partner like Best Buy or Walmart, or an online retailer like Amazon.</p><p>Where you bought your phone could make a difference here. For starters, different sales channels have different types of warranty. We all know about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Applecare and Samsung Care Plus</a>, but you&apos;re also able to buy extra protection from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/protect-amazon-tech-purchases-asurions-home-protection-plans">Asurion</a>. You might have seen this option when you bought a phone online or heard about it from a salesperson.</p>
<p>The warranty — which every phone has unless you&apos;re buying it in a country it wasn&apos;t intended to be sold in — is the first course of action if your phone is acting up. If you&apos;re unsure about who to contact for a warranty claim or if your warranty is still in effect, ask the place where you bought your phone, and they will help; they want you to be happy enough to buy your next phone from them, after all.</p><p>A special note here for people in North America who bought a phone through a carrier: you need to initiate any service or warranty claims through them because they&apos;re a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">special type of partner</a>. </p><p>A phone made by Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-att-phones">specifically for AT&T</a> (for example) is essentially an AT&T product. It was built by Samsung, and in the end, Samsung may be the one who fixes things, but it&apos;s still an AT&T product. Carrier phones in the U.S. and Canada are weird like that. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2033px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g" name="ATT-logo-building.jpg" alt="AT&T Store in NYC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRji8rSYBjVeYXgNQYLe3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2033" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re out of warranty and have no extended service contract, you have limited options. Some things, like a stuck button or malfunctioning camera, are fixable, but others — like a broken gyroscope — aren&apos;t. There&apos;s no way to isolate, decouple, and replace components like this that isn&apos;t going to cost less than buying a new phone.</p><p>Make sure you have an actual hardware issue. Something that happens in some apps but not in others is indicative of incompatible software and not "broken" hardware, so do a bit of sleuthing yourself and see if you can consistently cause the problem. One option is to use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-run-diagnostics-on-your-pixel">diagnostic tool</a>, like the one found on Pixel phones.</p>
<p>If you can, try asking a local phone repair center to take a look at it and diagnose the issue. This might cost a few dollars, and you might not like what they find, but it&apos;s better than sending your phone off somewhere and being without it for a week or two.</p><p>It also gives you an idea of what&apos;s wrong, whether it&apos;s fixable, and what it might cost. A local shop can repair or replace a lot of parts on a phone and a trip to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-repair-partner-ubreakifix-now-asurion-tech-repair-and-solutions">uBreakiFix store</a> might be just what the doctor ordered. </p>
<p>The sad reality is that phones are disposable consumer electronics and aren&apos;t designed to be serviced and repaired. Once your phone is out of warranty or an extended service contract, you&apos;re simply expected to buy a new one when it stops working the way it should.</p><p>With phones seeing seven years of software support, this may have to change. Until then, your best bet is to consider an extended warranty.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Galaxy Ring leak claims to have spotted several model numbers for the product, indicative of several sizes Samsung plans to provide.</li><li>The discovery highlights the existence of eight model numbers, with speculation that a ninth could be available on launch.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring is rumored to feature American ring sizes ranging from 5 to 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to shed light on the existence of several Galaxy Ring sizes for consumers later this year.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-ring/">GalaxyClub</a> (Dutch), Samsung&apos;s first smart ring could arrive in nine sizes as the device&apos;s model numbers appear (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-sizes-model-numbers-leak/">SamMobile</a>). An initial discovery showed that the Galaxy Ring will be placed under Samsung&apos;s new "Q" series for model identification. As such, the following model numbers echo that moniker.</p>
<ul><li><strong>SM-Q500</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q501</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q502</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q505</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q506</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q507</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q508</strong></li><li><strong>SM-Q509</strong></li></ul>
<p>There will apparently be nine ring sizes, although the publication&apos;s digging only unearthed eight Galaxy Ring models. Supposedly, the Galaxy Ring will "correspond" with American ring sizes when it hits the market, which would mean the device would range from size 5 to size 13. That range encompasses nine sizes, so we may see one more during the launch.</p><p>Speculation states the ninth model number would feature the "SM-Q503" or "SM-Q504" model numbers.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Ring&apos;s model numbers are seemingly listed in order of smallest (SM-Q500) to largest (SM-Q509).</p>

<p>Galaxy Ring development was reported to begin in May as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-release-unit-production-rumor">a previous rumor</a> suggests Samsung plans to produce 400,000 units in time for launch. The size of the Galaxy Ring could cause Samsung to have "no shortage" of parts, meaning it might be flexible enough to meet demand if the market dictates.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ring-eyes-on-mwc-2024">appearance at MWC 2024</a> with its smart ring confirmed that it will debut in platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black finishes. Following a Samsung executive&apos;s deleted LinkedIn post, there is an expectation that the company will unveil the Galaxy Ring during the second half of 2024. This could line up perfectly with the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-rumor">second Galaxy Unpacked</a> event, which could take place on July 10 in Pairs, France.</p>
