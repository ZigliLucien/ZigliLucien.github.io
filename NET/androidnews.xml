<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has announced its Q1 2024 financial earnings.</li><li>The company reported $80.5 billion in revenue, highlighting strong performance across its services.</li><li>Alphabet recently announced a major restructuring to better accelerate efforts to bring AI into its products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Alphabet announced its Q1 2024 earnings on Wednesday (April 25), reporting more than $80 billion in revenue, 15% up from the same quarter last year.</p><p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlights the company&apos;s strong focus on AI and the performance of other products. "Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud," Pichai says in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/91/b3/3f9213d14ce3ae27e1038e01a0e0/2024q1-alphabet-earnings-release-pdf.pdf">statement</a>.</p><p>"We are well under way with our Gemini era and there&apos;s great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation."</p><p>AI has been a big focus for Google, which has focused on injecting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model across its services, including Search and Workspace. Google has rolled out its Gemini AI on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and across other devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series, and soon, it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/googles-best-ai-models-are-coming-to-oppo-and-oneplus-phones">on OnePlus and OPPO phones</a>, helping to power various generative AI features.</p><p>Search is also up, with Alphabet reporting more than $46 billion in revenue. While Google has been testing generative AI in Search, the company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">named Liz Reid as the new head of Search</a>. The move signals a stronger focus on AI features in Search, as Pichai points out improvements in user response.</p><p>"Most notably based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results," he said during the earnings call.</p><p>When asked about how on-device Gemini AI on phones affects potential monetization, Pichai seemed confident that it shouldn&apos;t, noting that there are still plenty of use cases for accessing the cloud.</p><p>"... in terms of on-device versus cloud...there will be needs which can be done on-device, and we should definitely privacy standpoint, but there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don&apos;t see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus soft-cloud in any way."</p><p>Meanwhile, YouTube and Cloud also saw increased revenue during the quarter, but just like with Search, AI underscored everything that Google has been doing as it injects Gemini into various aspects of the business. It&apos;s no surprise, however, as other companies such as Meta continue to do the same.</p><p>Meta, which recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-earnings-q1-2024">reported its Q1 2024 earnings</a>, announced its latest AI model that&apos;s now found across its apps, as well as new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">multimodal search capabilities</a> for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</p><p>However, to combat the growing competition, Google is partnering with companies like Meta, bringing its search results to Meta AI for real-time results within the apps. Google also recently announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">massive internal reorganization</a>, combining its hardware and software teams to better accelerate momentum with new products and services, particularly with AI features.</p>

<ul><li>The FCC announced that it has voted in favor of restoring net neutrality across the country.</li><li>A press release states the FCC will begin to ensure ISPs no longer block or throttle a user's internet access while also becoming more active in service outages.</li><li>The FCC's vote states it can create a "national standard" where the internet becomes an "essential service" across the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) settled a vote today (April 25) to restore net neutrality in the country.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402082A1.pdf">the FCC</a>, the restoration places the internet back under the agency&apos;s "Title II telecommunications service" classification. The FCC states this will allow it to "protect consumers, defend national security, and advance public safety."Â </p><p>The current FCC Chairwoman, Jessica Rosenworcel, provided a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/net-neutrality-fcc-broadband-regulation-cc8421bc4f11a3e0f6ffc22c358fbfd0">AP News</a>, saying that "in our post-pandemic world, we know that broadband is a necessity, not a luxury." The measure had reportedly passed with a 3-2 split by party lines.</p><p>With net neutrality back on the table, there are a few factors that consumers should be aware of regarding their internet access and broadband networks.</p><p>The FCC states the vote&apos;s choice to restore neutrality "prohibits" internet providers from "blocking and throttling" a user&apos;s speeds and activities. Additionally, services can no longer pay to prioritize lawful content over others.</p><p>Regarding service outages, the FCC adds it can now play an active role in figuring out how to restore the internet for affected users.</p><p>The other side of things involves the FCC&apos;s ability to oversee national security. The press release states the government body has regained the ability to "revoke the authorizations of foreign-owned entities who pose a threat to national security to operate broadband networks in the U.S."</p><p>Lastly, the FCC&apos;s successful vote states it can now create a "national standard" where the internet is treated as an "essential service.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we voted to restore Net Neutrality. This reestablishes a national open internet standard to protect consumers, defend national security, and advance public safety. https://t.co/moRpznTDEd<a href="https://twitter.com/FCC/status/1783546289071800507">April 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>This has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/net-neutrality-fcc-joe-biden">been a long road</a>, as the FCC&apos;s rules were previously put in place in 2015 courtesy of then-Chairman Tom Wheeler. However, two years later, in 2017, the FCC voted to remove all such rules, taking us back to a time when ISPs could dictate certain aspects of our internet service. The only requirement was that internet services had to state publicly that they were going to block or throttle service.</p><p>After the Trump administration stripped away net neutrality rules, talks to bring them back reignited in 2021 after the Biden Administration produced a wide-ranged executive order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">calling the FCC to reinstate its rules</a>. For context, net neutrality ensures that all users have the same level of access and browsing speeds when surfing the web. As we&apos;ve seen following today&apos;s vote, ISPs can no longer throttle or block anything a user chooses to engage with.</p>

<p>X (Twitter) is planning to make a living room debut, and the platform&apos;s CEO has highlighted what users can expect.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1782771479383622004">posted on X</a> by CEO Linda Yaccarino, the "X TV app" is preparing to make its way to larger displays "soon." According to Yaccarino, the TV app hopes to become the "go-to companion" for "immersive" entertainment from the social media service. The teaser gave us a quick look at X&apos;s planned UI for the app, which looks a lot like YouTube.</p><p>The current build shows a user&apos;s profile icon at the top left above a search icon and a home button. X plans to create a few rows full of videos users can watch, with the first displaying what&apos;s "trending," followed by a "For You" section.</p><p>Yaccarino states the plan is for displayed content to be "engaging" and shown in "real-time."</p><p>The flipside highlights planned features. Yaccarino teases that users can begin watching a video on their smartphone before transferring it to their smart TV and that X is working on "effortless casting" to achieve this. The X TV app&apos;s search is "enhanced" so users can discover content quickly.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the small screen to the big screen X is changing everything. Soon weâll bring real-time, engaging content to your smart TVs with the X TV App. This will be your go-to companion for a high-quality, immersive entertainment experience on a larger screen.

<p>The company plans to implement AI software into the X TV app, which is said to help organize videos "by subject" for a personalized experience. Yaccarino briefly mentions the TV app&apos;s trending algorithm, stating it will help users stay updated with "tailored" popular content.</p><p>X is eyeing wider availability for its app as the company hopes to have it ready for "most" smart TVs. Yaccarino did not specifically say when users can expect the app to launch.</p><p>We&apos;ve known about the existence of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/elon-musk-x-launching-youtube-clone-for-smart-tvs">X TV app since March</a> when Elon Musk teased its coming availability. The idea is to bring more long-form videos on X to attention, and it seems that smart TVs in our homes are what the platform wants to do. More importantly, it was originally reported that X plans to debut its TV app exclusively on Amazon and Samsung TVs.</p><p>That no longer seems to be the case, with Yaccarino teasing availability for "most" smart TVs. But we&apos;ll have to wait and see once the app&apos;s development concludes.</p><p>The platform has been leaning into videos more, as it highlighted a high user engagement rate in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/transforming-the-global-town-square">blog post</a> in January. The company stated that the option to support long-form video uploads on X was met positively, shifting the service into a more "video-first" platform.</p>

Perhaps the best offer yet is this Amazon deal that carves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQXCFNT"><strong>a whopping 46% off the Google Pixel 7 Pro</strong></a>, a slightly older flagship that still reigns as an excellent option for most folks, especially at this price.Â </p><p>We even went so far as to call the Pixel 7 Pro the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">"best overall" Android phone</a> back in 2022, and while it&apos;s since been supplanted by newer devices, the iconic device continues to impress with a careful balance of Tensor G2 processing power, sophisticated design choices, and some truly remarkable camera technology. And thanks to Google&apos;s software promise, the Pixel 7 Pro will continue to get OS upgrades through next year and security updates through 2027.Â </p>

<p>The Pixel 7 Pro was a groundbreaking device when it first hit store shelves back in 2022, and now you can get your own for less than $500 when you buy the phone unlocked from Amazon. As we described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQXCFNT">our Google Pixel 7 Pro review</a>, the phone comes with astounding camera tech that still holds up today, plus the efficient Tensor G2 chipset, a vibrant 120Hz AMOLED display, and the same fancy AI features introduced by the Pixel 8 series.

<p><strong>âRecommended if: </strong>you want the Pixel experience but the Pixel 8 Pro is too expensive for you; you want a sub-$500 device that takes outstanding pictures.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if: </strong>you can afford a newer smartphone; you want a phone with more than a couple years of software support.</p><p>While most users really won&apos;t feel the age of the Google Pixel 7 Pro when it comes to performance, there are a few things to consider when buying any 2022 device. Naturally, you can expect a bit less software support than you&apos;d receive from a more recent model, and you could probably get a better deal if you process a trade-in or make some kind of upgrade to your wireless service.Â </p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> is likely to be revealed with a $500 price tag during Google I/O next month, so if you can wait a little bit longer, it might be interesting to see how that new midrange model compares to the Pixel 7 Pro.</p><p>But that being said, if your budget is under $500 and you want a great unlocked phone with powerful camera software and plenty of RAM, this Google Pixel 7 Pro deal presents a unique opportunity.Â </p>

<ul><li>Rumors suggest Google is planning to "relaunch" the Pixel Tablet and finally debut its long-awaited accessories alongside it.</li><li>The Pixel Tablet will supposedly arrive without its charging speaker dock, likely bringing the device down in price.</li><li>A tipster states the device's stylus and keyboard will come separately and could cost around $107 each.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors whisper that Google could look to "relaunch" the Pixel Tablet this year and finally give us those accessories we&apos;ve been (not-so) patiently waiting for.</p><p>The rumor stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1783190100089721263">MysteryLupin on X</a>, who stated that Apple had conveniently "delayed" the launch of its new iPad until "three days before Google" relaunches its Pixel Tablet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/24/pixel-tablet-pen-keyboard-2/">9to5Google</a>). Supposedly, the device&apos;s second debut will come without the charging speaker dock. Lupin adds consumers may find the Pixel Tablet available in Hazel and Porcelain colorways.</p><p>The other side deals with its accessories, as the tipster suggests Google will finally release its Pixel keyboard and stylus. Rumors allege that the pieces will cost â¬100 each.</p><p>They say there will be "no bundle" available for users to grab as the accessories will be sold separately.</p><p>Curiously, the supposed release timeframe is in May. Apple&apos;s upcoming event is on May 7, and if we&apos;re going by the rumor, Google&apos;s Pixel Tablet relaunch will be on Friday, May 10, meaning it&apos;ll come just a few days before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">I/O 2024 on May 14</a>.</p><p>Of course, take this rumor with a grain of salt for now, as Google has yet to reveal details about a relaunch or official first-party Pixel Tablet keyboard and stylus accessories.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's pure coincidence that Apple delayed their iPad launch to three days before Google will ârelaunchâ the Pixel Tablet (without dock) together with a Pen and Bluetooth Keyboard. Both will come for around â¬100 in Hazel and Porcelainð https://t.co/7ZDT4DpPcd<a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1783190100089721263">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>We&apos;d love for these rumors to be true, especially regarding the accessories, as rumors have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-accessories-spotted-stylus-keyboard">teased them since last year</a>. Remember: the Pixel Tablet launched with support for USI 2.0 stylus pens, but Google notably didn&apos;t provide its own version of the tool. Previous leaks unearthed the existence of a Google-made stylus and keyboard within the Pixel Retail Demo app.</p><p>Additionally, it was speculated that Google&apos;s Pixel Tablet should&apos;ve come out sooner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-more-accessories-rumor">but was delayed</a> due to the development of its accessories.</p><p>In other news, alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/rumored-pixel-tablet-2-codenames">Pixel Tablet 2&apos;s codenames</a> were spotted in February. The discovery of "Clementine" and "Kiyomi" put the possibility of a "Pro" model in contention. Perhaps the idea of Google re-releasing the original tablet <em>before </em>I/O 2024 makes sense. It leaves the main event open for the Pixel Tablet 2, which could make its debut during the event, similar to its predecessor last year.</p><p>We&apos;re only two weeks away from knowing for sure.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Tablet launched as a device that could work as an on-the-go partner or a sit-at-home buddy. The tablet, joined by its charging speaker dock, doubles as a convenient smart home display and comfortable screen for watching videos.

<ul><li>Reddit ran into some issues on Thursday morning, which led to the site being down for many users.</li><li>Reddit users flocked to sites like Twitter to complain about the outage.</li><li>After roughly an hour of outage reports, Reddit is back online.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you were having trouble connecting to Reddit this morning, you weren&apos;t not alone. On Thursday morning, the site appeared to be down for many users, with complaints about the outage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=reddit&src=typed_query">circulating on X</a>. However, things should be back to normal after the issue was taken care of.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/">Downdetector</a>, reports of the outage started just after 9:30 a.m. PT. Interestingly, this was after a previous incident affected users on Thursday morning, although that was a much smaller issue related to ads.reddit.com and has since been resolved. It&apos;s not clear if that incident was related to the more widespread outage. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redditstatus.com/">Reddit Status</a> page noted that the site was dealing with "elevated error rates" on the frontend.</p><p>The site was having trouble loading for many users, including our own staff.</p>

<p>The initial notice on the Reddit Status site was posted at 9:52 a.m. PT, indicating that the problem was being looked into. "An issue with a Reddit backend has impacted many users on our site. We are looking into the cause."</p><p>Shortly after, the site has updated the status of the incident, indicating that Reddit had "identified the issue, and are remediating it; reddit.com should be back shortly."</p><p>Finally, around 10:28 a.m. PT, the site noted that it "deployed a fix, and reddit is up & running again." As of now, the issue is fully resolved, and you should be able to go back to your regularly scheduled scrolling and trolling.</p><p>Our staff have also noticed that the website and app appear to be up and running again, and Reddit has indicated that it is "confident all Reddit services are available and stable."</p>

Whether that&apos;s a VR headset, a pair of AR glasses, or an AI companion that you wear, Meta has been working on it, and Caitlin Kalinowski has almost certainly been at the center of it.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to chat with KalinowskiâCK, as she likes to go byâwho previously led product design and integration for the Oculus Rift, Oculus Go, and Oculus Quest headset lines. She has two decades of product design experience, including the original Unibody MacBook Pro team and every Oculus hardware product released since the original Touch controllers for the Oculus Rift.</p><p>But while those chops are impressive, someone like Kalinowski is always looking toward the horizon for the next big thing. Now, she is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-iphone-moment-when-meta-launches-ar-glasses">Project Nazare</a>, Meta&apos;s first pair of true AR glasses that is set to redefine how we think of smart glasses.</p><p>And while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> have been a huge hit, Kalinowski tells me that what her team has been working on goes above and beyond the expectations set by existing products. Yes, that even includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">new video calling and AI features</a> just launched on Ray-Ban Metas. They&apos;re so impressive, she told me that they provide the "same degree of &apos;oh my God, WOW! I can&apos;t believe this!&apos; that the original Rift was" for her.</p>

<p>Six years ago, Meta went all-in on the standalone concept as it launched the Oculus Quest. Since then, we&apos;ve seen two new generations of headsets, recently culminating in the launch of Meta Horizon OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta&apos;s own Android for VR</a>. Kalinowski told me that there was "a huge debate internally early on" whether to focus on tethered headsets like the Rift or to go fully standalone with the Quest concept.</p><p>But well after the dust from those conversations has settled, Meta&apos;s next big product is said to have the same degree of "Oh my God, wow! I can&apos;t believe this!" that the original Rift had.</p><p>In my experience, most people who try a modern VR headset are usually immediately impressed. It&apos;s one of those experiences that&apos;s hard to put into words until you&apos;ve tried it for yourself, as the virtual becomes <em>actual </em>reality to your eyes and mind.</p><p>Kalinowski told me that she thrives on "giving customers a new experience they haven&apos;t had before," something that Project Nazare should be able to deliver if what I&apos;m being told rings true to the final product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mxa23399ApcQFXJPCLHNjB" name="Meta-RayBan-Smart-Glasses-New-Options.jpg" alt="New colorways for Meta Ray-Ban." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mxa23399ApcQFXJPCLHNjB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Kalinowski says she thrives on "giving customers a new experience they haven't had before."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>"The next big technology that I&apos;m working on now is a full pair of AR glasses," she says. That means not just a pair of glasses that can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rokid-ar-lite-rokid-max-2-announcement">mirror your smartphone</a> or something like Ray-Ban Metas that can take pictures or play music but one that completely augments the world you see by way of projected imagery.</p><p>Meta is working on a version of this for Quest 3 headsets this Fall â a feature appropriately called "Augments" â but it should pale in comparison to what a proper pair of AR glasses can deliver because of the quality degradation that comes with passthrough vision on a VR headset.</p><p>Kalinowski explained that "customers are going to be able to see both the original photons of the real world in addition to what overlay you effectively want to have." In plain terms, that means your view of the real world through these glasses isn&apos;t any different from how you would see them through a pair of sunglasses. The light isn&apos;t being fed through cameras and then reprojected in a "passthrough" fashion as it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-v64-update-improves-passthrough-casting-and-microphones">on the Meta Quest 3</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"Nothing prepares you for the high field of view immersion" of Project Nazare.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Instead, the micro OLED projectors â going on previous spec leaks of Project Nazare â will overlay virtual objects convincingly onto the world you see. However, current AR glasses that attempt to do this, like Snap Spectacles 4 or Magic Leap 2, have an extremely small field of view. That means the virtual object overlay is only in a tiny square in your field of view, which immediately breaks immersion.</p><p>As Kalinowski notes, "Nothing prepares you for the high field of view immersion" of Project Nazare. In other words, it&apos;s the game-changer AR glasses have needed because they can provide an immersive experience more like a VR headset while still maintaining a truly comfortable, wearable form factor.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL" name="Ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai.jpg" alt="Multimodal AI on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwkbZr7YpEWoEJNZFPnriL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the interview, Kalinowski was very careful to keep from revealing too much about products like Project Nazare "until they&apos;re ready." There&apos;s an important expectation to be set and Meta can&apos;t afford to release something too early, especially if the company plans to present it as the "iPhone moment" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants.</p><p>But the excitement in Kalinowski&apos;s voice is unmistakable. The company has clearly made a breakthrough in several important areas and is, undoubtedly, closer to fruition than possibly any company before it has been.</p><p>Some of the major breakthroughs have been because of the recent advancements in AI, but it&apos;s not just the generative AI like ChatGPT that you might think of when you hear the term. The company has been able to shrink its camera sensors because of AI, which can denoise imagery in real-time. That frees up more space for things like processors and batteries.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's an important expectation to be set and Meta can't afford to release something too early, especially if the company plans to present it as the "iPhone moment" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Additionally, Kalinowski said that AI can now be used to further enhance SLAM â short for Simultaneous Location and Mapping â and it&apos;s how smart robot vacuums know where they are in your home, for example. In this way, AI can be used to compress important data so that it can be processed more quickly, lowering the power requirements of the glasses.</p><p>Maybe more excitingly, she admitted that "we don&apos;t don&apos;t even know what they will all be yet" when referring to all the ways AI can be used to virtually increase the processing power and capabilities of low-power devices like AR glasses.</p><p>"We have looked at what&apos;s happening in AI and intentionally looked at our roadmap and made changes to take advantage of this AI revolution." In other words, how we thought AR glasses would work is completely different now that modern AI systems exist. "The exciting thing is AI is changing every week," she adds, which would certainly make designing a product as big as Project Nazare a challenge.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>"We have looked at what's happening in AI and intentionally looked at our roadmap and made changes to take advantage of this AI revolution."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Without using any examples that might reveal too much, Kalinowski described a scenario that would help illustrate AI&apos;s visual learning capabilities and how it can start to understand context in surprising ways. The AI might "understand that you&apos;re skateboarding" and present different contextual ways of providing input or even help quickly record a video when you pull off a sick trick â that last part is my own example based on the conversation.</p><p>But, as Kalinowski points out, sometimes we have to wait to see what&apos;s going to happen even when we have all the technology in place. "When GPS first came out, few would have guessed it would be used to call an Uber from anywhere," she noted. It&apos;s the clever combination of hardware and software ideas that really helps give these products that "must have" feeling.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The success of Ray-Ban Metas was "unusually awesome," which bodes well for future AR glasses that will do even more.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Realistically, though, that still means consumers likely won&apos;t get their hands (or heads) on Meta&apos;s AR glasses breakthrough <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ar-glasses-woes-push-release-to-2027">for another three years</a>. The success of Ray-Ban Metas was "unusually awesome," as Kalinowski said, and the product seems to have caught on in the same way the Oculus Quest 2 did when it launched in 2020.</p><p>Those good sales bode well for future AR glasses that will do even more and, yet, still look good doing it. The AI component of Ray-Ban Metas "wasn&apos;t even originally the core" of the product, yet it seems to be one of the most interesting reasons to buy a pair and use them daily.</p><p>As Meta continues to push the "open ecosystem" mantra, openness and other areas of transparency will ultimately help it gain the trust needed for people to use a pair of true AR glasses every day. It&apos;s an important piece of the puzzle that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked, and it&apos;s one that teams like Kalinowski&apos;s seem to have on their minds daily.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>As Meta continues to push the "open ecosystem" mantra, openness and other areas of transparency will ultimately help it gain the trust needed for people to use a pair of true AR glasses every day.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Kalinowski says her team has been watching the Ray-Ban Meta release closely and has been integrating lessons learned into the next big product. Things like privacy LEDs on the front and other similar features have made people more comfortable with having cameras on (and in) their faces throughout the day.</p><p>And while everyone won&apos;t be comfortable wearing them all the time, I can certainly foresee a future where most people are walking around with some form of reality-augmenting technology on their bodies. Whether that looks more like Ray-Ban Metas or the Humane AI Pin, it&apos;s entirely likely that the current app-based world we live in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-ai-could-make-app-based-smartphones-a-thing-of-the-past">will become a thing of the past</a>.</p>

New customers who use the code <strong>MOOLAH </strong>during checkout <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visible.com/10-off-promo"><strong>will save $10 per month</strong></a> on their first three months of wireless service at Visible, regardless of the plan. That discount drops the price of the Visible Basic plan down to only <em>$15 per month</em> for three months (taxes and fees included), while the top-rated Visible Plus plan descends to just $35 monthly for the first three months.Â </p>

<p>If you're finally ready to make the switch to Visible, use the code <strong>MOOLAH</strong> when you're checking out to save $10 per month on your first three months of coverage. The deal works for both the Basic and Plus plan at Visible, and you still get all of the stellar perks included therein, such as free coverage in Mexico and Canada, an unlimited mobile hotspot, and unlimited talk, text, and 5G/4G LTE data powered by Verizon.Â <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.visible.com/10-off-promo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6475afb3-54c3-41c4-9577-b3384d14fc65" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="New Customer offer: get $10 off your first three months of wireless when you use the code MOOLAH at Visible" data-dimension48="New Customer offer: get $10 off your first three months of wireless when you use the code MOOLAH at Visible">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>âRecommended if: </strong>you&apos;ve been thinking about switching wireless carriers; you get good Verizon coverage in your area.Â </p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a family plan; you&apos;re already a Visible user or you&apos;re happy with your current phone bill.Â </p><p>This new customer deal comes on the tail of a few other recent updates from the Verizon-owned wireless carrier. Last month, for example, Visible improved its popular Plus plan by boosting the speed of its mobile hotspot and throwing in one free Global Pass day every month. They&apos;ve also added a way for your to pay your phone bill annually, thereby saving some serious cash in the process (I&apos;m talking 26% off yearly when you sign up for Visible Plus).Â </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-buyers-guide">Visible deals</a> like this are fascinating because there&apos;s so little fine print involved. Taxes and fees are included in every price you see on the site, and you can cancel at any time with zero hassle. There&apos;s even a 15-day free trial if you want to explore service before you commit. It&apos;s for these reasons that Visible ranked as one of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a> long before the recent updates â even though they aren&apos;t <em>technically</em> an MVNO â but these new offers might send the carrier straight to the top.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible Wireless</a> is a full-stack carrier owned and operated by Verizon. They offer two simple data plans that include unlimited talk, text, data, a mobile hotspot, and free talk and text in Mexico and Canada. They also work with many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market. The slightly more-expensive Visible Plus plan comes with everything above, plus 50GB of premium data every month, unlimited talk and text in over 30 countries worldwide, and much more. Starting at only $45 per month (without this deal), it&apos;s no wonder we called the Visible Plus plan the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited data plan</a> that money can buy.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The COROS VERTIX 2S is an adventurer's watch announced on April 25 and shipping on April 27 for $699.Â </li><li>Replacing the original VERTIX 2, it has a redesigned GPS antenna, revamped HR sensor, and a slightly lighter case, but slightly shorter battery life.</li><li>Its epic battery life, MIP display, and bulky-but-rugged design make this device best suited for people spending days (or weeks) in nature at a time.Â </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The COROS VERTIX 2S has arrived nearly three years after the VERTIX 2, and not much has changed on the surface. It&apos;s another "Adventure Watch" for climbers, XC skiers, and mountaineers with epic battery life and dual-frequency tracking, with the same price, ruggedness, and MIP display. The differences between them are subtle, but potentially significant.Â </p><p>While the 2021 VERTIX 2 had dual-band and multi-GNSS tracking, COROS says that the VERTIX 2S has a "redesigned" antenna built to "improve positioning accuracy in dense city/ mountain environments." They also claim to have developed an "optimized GPS algorithm" to combat issues with outdoor climbing maps on steep slopes with the original VERTIX 2.Â </p><p>In addition, the COROS VERTIX 2S receives the same optical heart rate monitor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, with five LEDs and four photodetectors. While it draws more battery life, it does better accuracy-wise â the PACE 3 did quite well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">recent HR and fitness test</a> â and will handle stats like daily stress better.</p><p>Because of these improvements, the original VERTIX 2 beats the 2S battery in days (43 vs. 36 days with sleep tracking), GPS hours (127 vs. 118), and dual-frequency GPS hours (49 vs. 43).Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X6Zqp6cR9tTM9gXjitpxdg" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-carabiner.jpg" alt="The COROS VERTIX 2S sitting on top of a pile of carabiners." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X6Zqp6cR9tTM9gXjitpxdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While that might seem like a downgrade, the VERTIX 2S still matches or beats many of the best MIP watches out there for longevity. The Fenix 7X Pro Solar, for example, lasts 37 days or 122 GPS hours, only equaling the VERTIX 2S if it has a steady source of sunlight.</p>

<p>The VERTIX 2 and 2S largely share the same specs, except that the 2S is 2g lighter with the nylon band, and comes in new colors. COROS will only sell the 2S from now on, deprecating the VERTIX 2.</p><p>Having only briefly tested the VERTIX 2S, I can&apos;t speak to its hardcore adventuring features yet. Keep an eye out here this Sunday for a GPS and heart rate accuracy test against some other smartwatch flagships. I can still give some early info and impressions, however.</p><p>The COROS VERTIX 2S comes in a recyclable container â it&apos;s made of recycled materials, but is also designed to be reused as storage â and ships with both nylon and silicone straps, with a Quick Fit connector.Â </p><p>Given how heavy the VERTIX 2S is, you&apos;ll want to default to the nylon option, which makes it feel <em>somewhat</em> manageable, on par with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> despite being significantly thicker. That&apos;s probably thanks to the polymer materials, whereas most all-steel or titanium watches take more getting used to.</p><p>Shipping in Space (black), Moon (white), and Earth (blue), the VERTIX 2S is pre-installed with a watch face inspired by your chosen color. Our review unit, for example, has a spinning Earth viewed from the moon&apos;s surface, and it&apos;s a cute touch â though light on actual data. Â </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WuXTUdRcFVEPxhaq2GRWoN" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-side-view.jpeg" alt="Side view of the COROS VERTIX 2S buttons and thickness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WuXTUdRcFVEPxhaq2GRWoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As with most COROS watches, your experience will depend on your perspective on digital crowns. I&apos;m used to most "serious" fitness watches having up/down buttons, but COROS has the center dial for rotating and selecting, with the top button for the backlight and bottom button for backing out and settings.</p><p>The VERTIX 2S is a niche device, as the price suggests. For a couple hundred extra compared to, say, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a>, you get a full-sized display for offline mapping, waypoints with turn-by-turn navigation, and proper widgets during activities. Mountaineers will be able to check their altitude performance or real-time storm alerts, while climbers will appreciate features like fall detection or auto pitch-type detection.</p><p>That&apos;s all vitally useful for a certain class of athlete, but an everyday runner like me is better suited towards the PACE 3 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a>. I can&apos;t necessarily put these VERTIX 2S features through their paces unless I drive hours to a ski slope or (die trying to) scale a sheer cliff face or boulder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7nGbbpVYSKckZXpNX9AGpQ" name="COROS-VERTIX-2S-close-up.jpeg" alt="Close-up of the Earth watch face on the COROS VERTIX 2S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7nGbbpVYSKckZXpNX9AGpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you prefer MIP displays to AMOLED to get that insane battery life, then the VERTIX 2S will fall right in your wheelhouse. I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue"><em>not</em> an MIP fan</a>, personally, but this display is high-res enough to be comfortably readable, and it looks great outdoors. Indoors, I had to dive into the settings to activate the all-day gesture backlight, just so I could see what time it was without having to press a button.</p><p>Overall, if you already own the VERTIX 2 and like it, then I can&apos;t say for certain if you&apos;ll want to upgrade for another $699 / â¬699 / Â£599. Better heart rate accuracy and GPS maps make a real day-to-day difference, in theory; I&apos;ll report back soon once I know whether it&apos;s especially accurate in real-life testing.Â </p>

<ul><li>Google's plan to eliminate third-party cookie trackers has been postponed until next year.</li><li>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns about Google's new technology, Privacy Sandbox, potentially favoring Google and disrupting competition.</li><li>This isn't the first time Google has postponed its cookie removal plan; it's the third delay since initially announcing the two-year timeline in January 2020.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s plan to get rid of third-party cookie trackers is on hold until next year.</p><p>Google has been pushing back on ditching third-party cookies several times now. This time, the search giant blames it on the industry and regulatory backlash. Google needs to get approval from the UK&apos;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) first, making sure its new tech called Privacy Sandbox isn&apos;t messing with competition.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-disable-third-party-cookies-some-chrome-users-2024">originally planned to ditch third-party cookies in Chrome by the end of this year</a>, but now it&apos;s aiming for early 2025. But it&apos;s not set in stone yet. Google is crossing its fingers that it can strike a deal with both the CMA and the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO) before it can really kick things off.</p><p>The CMA, in particular, is worried about what the deprecation will mean for Google&apos;s rivals and the industry as a whole.</p><p>Google has also been catching some flak from advertisers who are sweating over the idea of losing third-party cookies on the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">favorite browser</a>. They&apos;re concerned about what this could mean for their wallets.</p><p>The news about the delay arrives just before Google and the CMA drop their quarterly reports.</p><p>âWe recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem,â Google said in a statement on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/update-on-the-plan-for-phase-out-of-third-party-cookies-on-chrome/" target="_blank">website</a> for the Privacy Sandbox. "It&apos;s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June."</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Google has hit the pause button on its original plan. Back in January 2020, the company said it would ditch third-party cookies "within two years" to make web surfing safer for everyone. But this is the third time it has delayed it.</p><p>In 2022, the CMA said that axing those third-party cookies in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> would throw the competition off balance, giving Google an unfair edge. The regulators told the company to come up with a new plan that doesn&apos;t tip the scales in its favor.</p><p>Google has been trying to play nice and meet all the CMA&apos;s demands, but truth be told, it hasn&apos;t quite managed to iron out all the wrinkles yet.</p><p>With the vague promise of a 2025 launch, there&apos;s a ton of uncertainty swirling around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-to-test-restricting-third-party-cookies-soon-before-ditching-them-for-good">Google&apos;s effort to deprecate third-party cookies</a>. And honestly, it feels like we&apos;re all just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>
