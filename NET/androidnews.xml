                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Meta AI is starting to roll out a new feature that plays off a user's selfie called "Imagine Me."</li><li>The feature requires three selfies of a user (from various angles) to then recreate them as a gladiator, on the moon, or as a flying space ranger.</li><li>Meta teased in a blog post that an "Edit with AI" button is on the way to bring users more creative agency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta has a fun feature on the way for its array of platforms that&apos;ll transform users into new versions of themselves thanks to AI.</p><p>Meta AI continues to advance and the company&apos;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xxBFYyF2X/?igsh=bGt0aG13MDF4YjJz">took to Instagram</a> to show off "Imagine Me." When messaging Meta AI on the platform, users can turn themselves into whatever they want by starting their prompt with "Imagine me" followed by a gladiator, football player, or whatever.</p><p>The short video shows that users can initiate an "Imagine Me" session but the AI will prompt them to take a few selfies. Users need to take three: one straight on, one from the right, and one from the left.</p><p>After, they can re-ask the AI to imagine them as a fictional or non-fictional person and see what it returns.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/meta-ai-is-now-multilingual-more-creative-and-smarter/">a blog post</a>, Meta explained that users will have some creative agency when asking the AI to imagine them as a DJ. The company states that if something isn&apos;t right after delivering a prompt, users can type "change" followed by the object or items they&apos;d like to be different.</p><p>Meta states that "next month," users will gain an "Edit with AI" button when texting with its software. The post doesn&apos;t explain what all the edit section will entail, but hopefully, filters, cropping, and more will be involved.</p>

<p>Users eager to get their hands on "Imagine Me" can begin doing so this week as Meta starts rolling it out. The company adds that folks can create an image of themselves directly in their feed, stories, comments, and Messages found on Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger.</p><p>It was first discovered that WhatsApp would be receiving this feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">earlier this month</a>, with the ability to pull up the feature in other chats. The app&apos;s code highlighted the user&apos;s ability to type "@Meta imagine me" in another chat with a fellow user to show yourself off walking on the moon thanks to AI. What&apos;s more, it seems that more companies are getting in on the idea of reimagination <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/another-ai-packed-feature-could-be-on-the-way-for-youtube-shorts">such as YouTube</a>.</p><p>It seems Google is experimenting with an AI feature for YouTube Shorts that would let users simulate an AI-based green screen behind them while recording. "Dream Screen" would enable creators to make it seem like they&apos;re on top of a mountain or in the depths of the most beautiful ocean.</p>

<p>The wait is over: Samsung&apos;s newest lineup of foldable phones has landed and I&apos;ve done the work of gathering all of the best Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals so you don&apos;t have to. Whether you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity, straight discount, or you simply have a question about the innovative foldable, everything you need to know about buying the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 can be found in this guide.</p><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">our recently-published initial review</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 boasts the power of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, two gorgeous 120Hz displays, and one of the best folding hinges ever built into a smartphone. The problem is that the phone also starts at a whopping $1,899.99 for the 256GB version, which is why the following deals are so important. </p><p>A lot of these offers are holdovers from the Z Fold 6&apos;s preorder period, so we don&apos;t know how long they&apos;re going to last. In other words, don&apos;t wait too long if a deal catches your eye or you might end up paying full price on a super price-y smartphone. </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a refinement of nearly everything that made its predecessor such a groundbreaking device. The foldable phone is thinner, lighter, and, well, more foldable than the Z Fold 5, thanks to its newly-designed "dual rail" hinge structure. You also get a performance boost thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (the same chipset that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-and-availability">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>), a brighter display, and seven years of OS updates straight out of the box. </p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cost?</h2>
<p>The biggest issue that we have with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its price. With a starting price of $1,899.99, the upcoming foldable is $100 more expensive than the already-very-expensive Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, and you&apos;re not even getting new camera technology or improved battery life out of the deal. So considering the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs the Z Fold 5, is the new phone worth the upgrade? </p><p>That&apos;s ultimately your call, but hopefully the preorder deals above can soften any financial blow if you decide to buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>The supposed design for the upcoming Pixel Buds Pro 2 has leaked, which teases slight changes for the buds.</p><p>It seems phone accessory/case maker Spigen jumped the gun as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1eaz8zt/pixel_buds_pro_2_design_leak/">a user on Reddit</a> discovered an ad for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). The Amazon ad a brief look at the Buds themselves, which appear to be slightly bigger than the O.G. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Buds Pro</a>. The device keeps its smooth surface for user touch controls, however, that top portion looks taller while the buds seem closer together in the case.</p><p>Another slight change is with the grills that the Pro edition features. Both instances of it are now colored the same as the Buds instead of retaining a black hue like before.</p><p>The slightly taller Buds make one wonder if there&apos;s a hardware reason behind it, like audio/battery upgrades.</p><p>The early glimpse gives us a look at a curious addition to the bottom of the Buds Pro 2 case — a new cutout. This appears quite important as Spigen&apos;s ad highlights "cutouts for easy pairing and sharing." The publication theorizes it could be a small speaker for users trying to relocate the device using Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device network</a>.</p><p>For now, its purpose remains unclear. The case doesn&apos;t appear radically different from the previous generation as it still sports an egg-like shape in all white.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1eaz8zt/pixel_buds_pro_2_design_leak">Pixel buds pro 2 design leak</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds">r/pixelbuds</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Slowly but surely, more information is surfacing regarding Google&apos;s next earbuds following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-summer-vibe-colors-leak">recent color leak</a>. The Buds in Spigen&apos;s ad feature a "Raspberry" hue, which was rumored alongside Porcelain, Haze, and a summer-vibe Mojito. There&apos;s a chance that some of these color choices are done to match the Pixel 9 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">which we&apos;ve also seen</a> previously.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Buds Pro 2 was reportedly spotted snagging its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-spotted">battery certification</a> for the case. The listing showcased the case&apos;s 650mAh battery, which is a 30mAh increase over what the original iteration offers. But luckily we&apos;re not too far from knowing all the details as Google is preparing for an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event</a> on August 13.</p>

Well, it&apos;s not <em>really</em> dead, but it seems that way, and it&apos;s not going to change in the next few years.</p><p>There are important changes in the bits inside things like our phones. Things you probably can&apos;t see or when you hear about them you&apos;ll respond with a shrug if anything. Powerful co-processors and dedicated NPUs just aren&apos;t very sexy to regular folks like us who buy this stuff. </p>
<p>Fancy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tsmc-qualcomm-2nm-chip">new chips from Qualcomm</a> or Apple and faster memory are important though, because they power the big changes we can see; new features and improvements to all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">software that powers our favorite tech toys</a> will be the thing that makes us want to buy them.</p><p>This isn&apos;t anything new. Software changes have long been a big selling point when some executive stands on a stage to tell you why their product is the best. What&apos;s going to change is the pace and scale of these changes, while the devices that provide them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">seem to be unchanged</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-6.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VBMaZUZdQBNrGEvpfo2xUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A lot of folks aren&apos;t going to be happy about this. Expect to see headlines from the tech press saying that the next device from Apple, Samsung, or Google will be just like the last device—especially when some of the software changes will work their way back to the older models.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean a lot, though. The <em><strong>only</strong></em> reason to buy an older model of something like a phone or watch is to save money (it&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">a really good reason</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a big improvement over the Galaxy Watch 6 (for example) in every measurable way, even if it looks mostly the same on the outside. These improvements will show themselves when it comes to those software features designed to make them something we want to buy because they will work better. A lot better.</p>
<p>You already know why. It&apos;s that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">stupid little thing called AI</a> that companies want to cram into everything because they feel like it will make us want gadgets even more than we do now. Even the most mundane things, like your phone&apos;s home screen wallpaper, have AI forcibly injected into them. </p><p>This sort of thing needs better hardware to grow, but it&apos;s not hardware that seems like a showcase feature. Look at the latest processors from Apple or Qualcomm to see what I&apos;m saying. Yes, they are XX% faster and will supposedly get XX% better battery life because those are improvements we see every year, even when a chip isn&apos;t great.</p>

<p>The big changes, and what makes these new components important, are the ways they can handle the copious amount of AI processing the devices using them will require. Everything from phones to smart doorbells are now miniature factories of AI software. All of them need better hardware under the hood, working in ways nobody cares about.</p><p>We should probably be excited about all of this. It&apos;s easy to get burnt out by "AI Everywhere" when all the tech companies are using it in all the things. But this will lead to that next big thing when it comes to the features we want. It simply needs a smart team to dream them up and develop them.</p>
<p>This will last for a few years, and then we&apos;ll go back to seeing phones that seem all new and different each year. Until then, expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-leaked-hands-on-video">Pixel 9</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ios-16-features-android">iPhone 16</a> to be a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> on the outside unless you count a different-shaped camera bump or a new color. Give them a few months, though, and we&apos;ll see where the real changes are and why we should (or shouldn&apos;t) want to buy them.</p>

<p>EssilorLuxottica is the eyeglass retailer that you might not know is behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>. To make these spectacles, Meta brought the tech smarts and EssilorLuxottica brought the experience — the company has been making eyewear under some name or another since 1849. Following the overwhelming success of the Meta Ray-Bans, Meta is reportedly interested in continuing its relationship with the eyeglass company, but Google might have something to say about that. </p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202244/google-meta-ray-ban-essilorluxottica-partnership" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Google reached out to EssilorLuxottica about making a new pair of smart glasses with Gemini, its AI assistant. It&apos;s unclear what a partnership between Google and the eyeglass maker might look like; however, The Verge&apos;s sources say it&apos;s “extremely unlikely” that Meta would be dropped in the process. That said, it&apos;s unsurprising that Google is starting to make real preparations for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-all-different-types-smart-glasses-and-ones-are-best">smart glasses</a> product.</p><p>Of course, Google is known for infamously making Google Glass ahead of its time. More recently, the company has publicly made moves toward returning to the augmented reality space. For example, it briefly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">showed off a prototype version of AR smart glasses</a> with Gemini capabilities at Google I/O earlier this year. It also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">demoed Project Starline and Project Astra</a>, both of which make use of augmented reality and AI to provide new experiences.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tried out Project Astra in a demo at Google I/O, and its easy to see how this kind of technology could integrate with a pair of smart glasses. Project Astra is a multimodal AI modal that can process visual input, voice input, and text. While most large language models (LLMs) only have the information stored in their data sets and training materials, multimodal models are more versatile. A model like Project Astra could tap into an LLM, multimodal input for context, and web results for up-to-date information, for example. </p><p>Currently, Project Astra seems to be in its early stages. Google released a pretty convincing pre-recorded video showing its capabilities ahead of its developer conference, but it didn&apos;t back that up in live demos. There also isn&apos;t an official release date for when Project Astra might release. Meanwhile, OpenAI is getting closer to fully debuting its multimodal GPT-4o model with voice. Meta updated its Ray-Ban smart glasses to support multimodal inputs, too. </p><p>A partnership between Google and EssilorLuxottica could result in a smart glasses product with Gemini, which has already started to take over in Android, replacing the Google Assistant in many areas. The version of Gemini that would ship with smart glasses would likely feature many of the experimental functionalities Google has shown off under the Project Astra name. </p><p>However, it seems likely that either Google or Meta would want some level of exclusivity with EssilorLuxottica. The two companies will be strong competitors when and if Google releases a pair of smart glasses. You could argue that they are already competing in the key areas of artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, and social networking. While there is an obvious benefit for EssilorLuxottica to partner with as many companies as makes sense, I&apos;m not sure Meta or Google will go for it. </p>
<h2 id="why-the-meta-and-essilorluxottica-partnership-just-makes-sense-2">Why the Meta and EssilorLuxottica partnership just makes sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-on-rocks.jpeg" alt="A side view of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gfsiwsT4LqFHiCZyWgtB2Y.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s reported interest in teaming up with EssilorLuxottica seems like a long shot if, for no other reason, its current partnership with Meta just makes sense. Meta was the first to pull off mainstream smart glasses, and they&apos;re in physical retail stores nationwide. Prior attempts from Google and from other companies — like Snapchat and Amazon — haven&apos;t been nearly as successful. </p><p>There&apos;s also another factor to consider. EssilorLuxottica&apos;s brands have real value, and the company can&apos;t waste its brand power and integrity on a half-baked project from Google. We already know that Google has a propensity to kill off projects before even giving them room to grow, and that creates a risky situation for a traditional retailer like EssilorLuxottica. Ray-Ban, for example, is a valuable brand with instantly-recognizable designs. Partnering with Google for a lesser product could cause more harm to that brand than good. </p><p>Finally, Meta isn&apos;t going to lose that partnership easily. In fact, the company is proactively looking to make a sizable investment in EssilorLuxottica. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da37b6a-b241-4090-9445-467087694ab7" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta wants to buy 5% of the eyeglass maker in exchange for billions. Meta owning a stake in the company, even a small one, would go a long way in ensuring that their partnership will continue. Unlike the rumored Google talks, the Meta/EssilorLuxottica deal is said to be advanced and likely to be finalized. </p><p>It shouldn&apos;t be surprising that Google is opening up a line of communication with EssilorLuxottica. The company has a recognizable brand and more than a century of experience making eyewear. However, I think Meta and EssilorLuxottica are deeply intertwined at this point, and a new deal would be high risk and low reward for the European eyeglass conglomerate. Google might have to turn elsewhere if it wants to mass-produce a new pair of smart glasses.</p>

<p>The Google Play Store has millions of apps to choose from, but while that means you have plenty of options, it also means finding the right app can be difficult. Google is announcing a host of new ways it&apos;s improving curation and app discovery on the Play Store, but it&apos;s doing it in a way I didn&apos;t expect: it&apos;ll be using humans to do the job, not AI.</p><p>This seems counter to what the company has been doing lately with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. While there&apos;s a light AI component to the equation, Google&apos;s new Collections feature highlights the importance of having humans at the center of a human-focused policy change.</p><p>I had the opportunity to interview Aurash Mahbod, the General Manager of Games for Google Play, about this new move and other changes being made to the Play Store and to try out the new changes at a special Google Play press event in New York City.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:178.00%;"><img id="yo4pTkjoZkB9jFmqKvFLAQ" name="google-play-manga.gif" alt="Scrolling through manga on the Google Play Store's new comics section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yo4pTkjoZkB9jFmqKvFLAQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="534" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s new curation changes are starting in Japan with the launch of a new Comics tab today. Comics is a collection of Japanese Play Store users’ favorite things, including traditional page-by-page manga, new vertically-scrolling manga, anime, and even live chats and videos with your favorite creators.</p><p>The inclusion of live tiles, videos, and other personal recommendations based on interests is unique among the many times Google has tried to improve curation over the years. I&apos;m fact, it&apos;s part of a larger move to make the Play Store “a destination” instead of a place users only go to for apps.</p><p>Jumping to the comics section showed me the latest manga releases, including the ability to read the manga right from the Play Store without having to open another app. Some of this builds on the Instant Apps feature Google launched years ago, but bringing YouTube-style live chats and videos to the platform is something new entirely. In other words, you won&apos;t need to go anywhere else to find out what&apos;s new, regardless of your interests.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.12%;"><img id="CHGhqPYcFwq77tF7ubosBX" name="google-play-july-2024-update.jpg" alt="A look at the new Play Store curated collections including shopping, music, and social" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHGhqPYcFwq77tF7ubosBX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1518" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, Google is expanding this concept to sports, shopping, music, and more with specifically human-curated sections of the store based on your interests. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-im-using-fitness-tech-train-my-marathon">Marathon runners</a>, for example, may find a new section that shows them all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">best apps to use to prepare for a marathon</a>, including some obvious picks — like training or dieting apps — but also some less obvious ones, like stopwatches and timers that might not normally be categorized as a “running app,” too.</p><p>There&apos;s even a new hot bar at the bottom of each curated section, which provides quick one-tap access to recommended apps that can run instantly, whether you have the app installed or not.</p><p>Many of these tabs and curated lists are spun off from a new multi-select interests feature that&apos;ll be presented to Play Store users over the coming days and weeks, helping to better personalize content. You can even remove installed apps from the personalize list, ensuring that one-off app installs don&apos;t mess up your beautifully curated store.</p>

<p>A new resizable widget is also launching to highlight curated Play Store content, giving you quick access to recommendations right from the home screen.</p><p>Mobile gamers are getting a few treats in the update, as well. An expansion of Google Play Games for PC now syncs your saves to the cloud so you can seamlessly move between your favorite platforms without losing progress. This makes it easy to play your favorite games on the go and enjoy them on the TV or monitor once you get back home.</p><p>Google Play Games for PC is also launching the ability to run multiple games at once, so you can enjoy a more active game while your Clash of Clans session continues on the side.</p>

<p>Mahbod told me these moves are in an effort to make Play Games the “ultimate gaming destination” since you can play all your favorite titles on seemingly any device you want. Yes, that likely includes the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a> being co-developed by Samsung and Google.</p><p>These changes also come together to ensure that Google can provide intrinsic value to developers who often struggle to keep users interested in games for the long haul. Curation doesn&apos;t just include new apps but also important app updates, helping to pull users back in if they&apos;ve stopped playing a game for a long period of time.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-all-means-2">What this all means</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MQQWT82oa8HJ46FX29j6ZY" name="google-play-app-release-stats-july-2024.jpg" alt="App release stats for Google Play as of July 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MQQWT82oa8HJ46FX29j6ZY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has tried to usher in better curation in the past and this is the latest attempt to keep users more interested in the Play Store instead of just coming back once in a blue moon for app updates. This latest move has the real potential to work, but there are also some obvious problems with any sort of "personalization." </p><p>At the forefront, Google faces is potential user backlash at becoming yet another ad. Since services like Google and Facebook are free, users are often "the product" as they are served ads in one form or another. While I didn&apos;t see any obvious signs of an "ad" during my hands-on time with the new Google Play updates, there&apos;s little doubt that Google&apos;s curation decisions will be influenced by sponsors along the way.</p><p>Moves like this are mainly designed to appease developers, especially as live service games like Fortnite or the latest iteration of Candy Crush continue to cost lots of money to keep updated. User retention is vital to keeping these games alive, and Google has to be creative in its endeavor to keep users interested.</p><p>But what&apos;s good for developers is also good for users. As consumers, we&apos;re always looking for the next big thing. It&apos;s just the nature of how capitalism works and Google is playing to that with these updates. Giving users what they want — a never-ending stream of great new apps and games — will inevitably keep people happy and coming back for more.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Digital Chat Station has come up with some interesting details about the next foldable phone from Oppo.</li><li>The upcoming foldable from Oppo will likely be available as OnePlus Open 2 in select markets.</li><li>According to the tipster, we might see a huge battery improvement in the upcoming foldables from OnePlus and Oppo.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus introduced its first foldable, the OnePlus Open, last year. Its successor is one of the company&apos;s most anticipated devices, yet to be released, and until now, very little is known about the handset. However, new information from a prominent tipster reveals what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>Before getting into the leak, one should know that OnePlus and Oppo share the same design elements for most premium devices, especially with foldables. For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">Oppo Find N3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> turned out to be the same handsets, including what they pack underneath; however, they were catered to different regions.</p>
<p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_172180316594010&key=b8f771eed689587b82c4635131ce08d7&libId=lyygo1k101010l04000UL1i1foghef917h&loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2024%2F07%2F22%2Foneplus-open-battery-sequel-rumor%2F&ccpaConsent=1---&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F6048569942%2FOop291Dik&title=OnePlus%20Open%20sequel%20allegedly%20has%20a%206%2C000%20mAh%20battery%2C%20somehow&txt=Weibo%20from%20%3Cem%3EDigital%20Chat%20Station%3C%2Fem%3E">Digital Chat Station</a> on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/oneplus-open-battery-sequel-rumor/">9to5Google</a>), Oppo&apos;s next foldable release is aimed for Q1 2025. It is also expected to pack the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which will likely be unveiled at Snapdragon Summit later this year. The other interesting element is the massive 6000mAh battery, which is rumored to power the next foldable from Oppo.</p><p>As mentioned, this translates to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> packing the same specs as Oppo&apos;s upcoming foldable. While it&apos;s interesting to have some insights about the forthcoming book-style phones, it is worth noting that Digital Chat Station didn&apos;t specifically mention the aforementioned handset in the Weibo post. </p><p>Instead, it was hinted at amid Huawei&apos;s next triple foldable handset&apos;s discussion on the Weibo post. The tipster mentioned a blue-green phone, presumed to be Oppo&apos;s and hence the Find series, which is presumably the OnePlus Open 2. As 9to5 points out, it is worth considering the speculation mentioned earlier with a grain of salt.</p><p>Nonetheless, if the above rumor is accurate, we might see a promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> from the company that can compete with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Honor Magic V3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4</a>, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung's Q80C smart TV is an absolute beast of entertainment, with an AI-powered processor for real-time 4K upscaling, Dolby Atmos and Object Tracking Sound, and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Samsung is currently dropping a straight 41% off the 75-inch version of the TV, but other sizes appear to be selling out fast; don't wait if you're interested! </p>

<p>My favorite model included in the sale, Samsung's The Frame series of smart TVs are specially designed to look just like a framed work of art whenever they aren't in use, with an ultra-thin design that sits flush against the wall and an anti-glare matte finish. You also get QLED 4K resolution and 100% Color Volume. Grab the 55-inch smart TV during the Samsung sale and you'll get a straight $500 off. </p>
