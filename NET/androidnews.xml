                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The future is going to be powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and to make sure the technology benefits everyone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147831">United Nations recently passed its first-ever resolution on AI</a>. This is a big deal for a hollow set of unenforceable suggestions, so let&apos;s break down what this means for you and the world.</p><p>The core message is safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. Co-sponsored by over 120 countries, the resolution emphasizes developing AI that respects human rights and promotes sustainable development. It also says AI systems shouldn&apos;t discriminate or reinforce biases and should be designed to solve problems like climate change and poverty.</p><p>Sounds good enough, right? Even so, we still have a long way to go.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-good-about-the-resolution-2">What&apos;s good about the resolution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.30%;"><img id="uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP" name="UN-general-assembly.jpg" alt="UN General Assembly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="530" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: United Nations)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resolution acknowledges the "digital divide" between developed and developing countries. Not everyone has equal access to technology, and the UN is calling for collaboration to ensure everyone has the chance to participate in the AI revolution. This could involve sharing resources and knowledge to help developing nations build their own AI capabilities.</p><p>The UN isn&apos;t just pointing fingers at governments here. This resolution is a call to action for everyone—countries, businesses, researchers, and even regular folks like you and me. We all have a role to play in shaping the future of AI. Because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your next phone</a> will be chock full of AI, you are doing your part even if you don&apos;t know it.</p>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution is a positive step towards a future where AI works for everyone. By focusing on safety, human rights, and global cooperation, we can harness the power of AI to build a better world.</p><p>The resolution itself <em>isn&apos;t</em> a set of rules but a framework for future discussions and collaborations. It&apos;s a commitment from the international community to work together and ensure AI benefits all of humanity. We can expect to see more specific guidelines emerge in the coming years.... and that&apos;s its biggest problem.</p>
<h2 id="toothless-tiger-2">Toothless tiger</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La" name="kittens.jpg" alt="Kittens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PetsRadar.com)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resolution promoting safe and beneficial artificial intelligence was a landmark achievement. It signifies a global recognition of the need to harness AI&apos;s power for good while mitigating potential risks. However, while this is a positive step, the resolution itself has limitations that require us to keep the conversation going.</p><p>The biggest shortcoming lies in the resolution&apos;s non-binding nature. Unlike Security Council resolutions, these don&apos;t hold legal weight. This means countries with vested interests in autonomous weapons development, for example, might not feel compelled to alter course. The resolution relies on "encouragement" for responsible AI development, which has limitations.</p>
<p>The UN is only as powerful as the few "major" countries allow it to be. Countries like China, Russia, and the United States usually only approve and support the UN when a thing aligns with their interests. Since these countries have the power to unilaterally veto any resolution, the good intentions of other member-states mean nothing.</p><p>A nonbinding agreement that was unanimously adopted means nothing. But it&apos;s the only way a resolution like this would pass. Getting "words on paper" is an important first step towards real, meaningful work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n" name="sundar-pichai-oct-2015-5.jpg" alt="Sundar Pichai" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a global set of rules, each nation or governing body has to step in. We&apos;ve seen this with things like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Biden Administration&apos;s recent order</a> that ensures the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Department of Homeland Security are working towards a way to test that AI systems are both safe and secure before they are released. This followed a (nonbinding) agreement between 18 countries declaring that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-britain-other-countries-ink-agreement-make-ai-secure-by-design-2023-11-27/">AI systems be made secure by design</a>.</p><p>The EU has also enacted legislation regulating AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-provisional-agreement-ai-act-regulate-artificial-intelligence">making it the first government to do so</a>. In the landmark act, the EU also has laid the groundwork for enforcement options.</p><p>Another alternative way to self-regulate AI is what we&apos;ve seen in Canada. Before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-canada-launch">the release of Google Gemini</a>, Google met with "experts, policymakers, and regulators across different sectors" to ensure AI was responsible and worked well for the people of Canada, according to Product Manager Jules Walker.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, the resolution is a crucial first step. It fosters international dialogue and establishes a foundation for future, more specific regulations. Here&apos;s what could be done as a next step:</p>
<ul><li>Member states can build upon the resolution by developing supplementary agreements with concrete enforcement mechanisms.</li><li>International bodies can work towards establishing global standards for AI development and deployment.</li><li>Developed nations can assist developing countries in building the infrastructure and expertise needed for responsible AI use.</li></ul>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution might not be a silver bullet; it&apos;s a call to action. By acknowledging its limitations and working towards a more robust framework, we can ensure AI becomes a force for good on a global scale.</p><p>If the world instead chooses to ignore these guidelines, we&apos;ll see an AI free-for-all where a few powerful countries and corporations decide our fate.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones have been facing display stuttering problems that date back to October 2023.</li><li>Now, Google has updated the Issue Tracker listing related to the problem, marking it as "fixed."</li><li>But the actual fix won't become available until Android 15 publicly releases, which is many months away. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A longtime Pixel bug finally has a resolution in sight, at least according to Google. The company updated an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305195207?pli=1" target="_blank">Issue Tracker report</a> on March 26 related to display stuttering problems on Pixel 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-just-marked-pixel-scrolling-stutter-as-fixed/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). Google marked the issue as "fixed," but that designation comes with a massive catch. The fix won&apos;t actually roll out to Pixel 8 series device owners until Android 15 is publicly available, and that won&apos;t be for many more months. </p><p>"Ongoing optimizations in performance and power are slated for the next Android release," a Google employee wrote in an Issue Tracker comment. "These include improvements positively impacting overall system UI jank as well as use cases tied to some Android applications."</p><p>This timeline means that Pixel 8 users will need to wait even longer for a proper fix since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is slated for a likely release in late summer or fall. It could end up taking a full year for Google to fix this problem, considering that the first report in this Issue Tracker thread was posted October 14, 2023. </p><p>Users continued posting comments in the thread, with over 100 comments being posted in total. Pixel 8 owners recounted screen stutters in some system and first-party apps, like the Google Play Store. Others also noticed abnormalities in third-party apps, such as Reddit and X (formerly Twitter). </p>

<p>In the days since Google first marked the issues as fixed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> users flooded the Issue Tracker thread with commenters explaining their displeasure. One user called the fixed designation "a bad joke" and said it shows "Google either cannot solve the problem or is not taking it seriously."</p><p>"If we really have to wait till August or longer for this to be fixed...well, it&apos;s seriously going to impact my choice next time I purchase a smartphone," wrote another Pixel 8 user. </p><p>The length of time it will have taken Google to fix this issue is also being considered in light of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">Google&apos;s promise of seven years of software support</a>. Apparently, the company is still struggling to fix issues in a timely manner. </p>

<ul><li>Instagram was spotted working on a new feature called "Blend," which would merge your tastes in Reels with a friend's for a thread of recommended short videos.</li><li>The feature is still in development, but its early description states that your Blend is private between you and one other person.</li><li>Instagram's Blend gives strong callbacks to a Spotify feature of the same name, which launched a few years back.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram has been spotted working on "Blend," a way for users to gain a new perspective on Reels.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/alex193a/status/1773268623219396714?s=20">Alessandro Paluzzi</a> on X, Instagram has started developing "Bend" as a set of recommendations based on your Reels share history (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/instagram-is-developing-blend-recommended-reels-for-you-and-a-friend/">TechCrunch</a>). Essentially, a Blend would work by leveraging the sharing history of Reels between you and one other person.</p><p>Its description notes that these Blends are "private between the two of you. You can leave Blend at any time."</p><p>Speculation suggests that this Blend page, which looks like a personal DM thread, would surface a feed of Reels. However, some information remains unknown, like how often Instagram would enable Blend to be updated with new recommended Reels. </p><p>Additionally, it feels likely that Instagram would tuck Blend into its "New Message" option on its DMs page, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#Instagram is working on Blend: #Reels recommendations based on reels you've shared each other and your reels interests 👀ℹ️ Private between the two of you.

The music streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-blend-now-official-letting-friends-compare-their-musical-taste">introduced Blend</a> as a way for up to 10 people to merge their tastes in music for a continuously changing playlist of songs. Their blended playlist would be updated daily and feature the users&apos; pictures beside songs they feel represent their combined taste.</p><p>The update cadence of Spotify&apos;s version is quite quick — and helps stir in variety and discovery daily. It&apos;s not clear how deep in development Instagram is of its coming iteration, so we might be a ways away from its arrival.</p><p>Meanwhile, a little bit of fun was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-play-pong-with-emojis-in-this-secret-instagram-game">added to Instagram&apos;s DMs</a> earlier this month by way of the classic game "Pong." As a slight change, users can play Pong with a friend using emojis. Users can kickstart this secret DM game by sending an emoji to a friend or receiving one from them. Tapping their emoji (or vice versa) will produce the hidden game of Pong.</p>

<ul><li>Developers will no longer be able to publish new games for the Oculus Quest 1 after April 30, 2024.</li><li>Newly published apps and games will not show up on the original Oculus Quest store after April.</li><li>Meta will only provide security updates through the end of August 2024.</li><li>The company originally set January 1 as the date when it would stop allowing new games on the Oculus Quest.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>An email sent out to all Meta Quest developers detailed Meta&apos;s end-of-life strategy for the original Oculus Quest. The email notes that no new apps or games may support the original Oculus Quest after April 30, 2024. Furthermore, apps and games published after April 30 will not show up when searched for on an Oculus Quest 1.</p><p>Meta announced its original plans to sunset support for the Quest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-1-needs-to-die-but-now-is-not-the-right-time">last January</a>, but the original date for disallowing new apps was extended a few months. Originally, Meta planned to keep new Quest 1 apps from being published starting January 1, 2024.</p><p>This all means that developers can no longer make new games supporting the original Quest after May 1, which means customers will need to upgrade to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Quest 2 or Quest 3</a> if they want to continue to play brand new games. Many developers stopped supporting the original Quest in the past year or so, and Meta stopped supporting multiplayer parties on the system in March 2023.</p><p>Beyond that, Meta will send out the last monthly security update in August 2024, signifying the official end of life for the company&apos;s first major standalone VR headset. Users will still be able to access games they own and use the Quest as a PCVR headset, so while it won&apos;t become a paperweight, it would be smart to upgrade to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-128gb-vs-512gb">Meta Quest 3 128GB or 512GB</a> headset to keep playing the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> in the future.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Home team held an AMA on Reddit, and users chimed in heavily to voice their displeasure and curiosity about the app's development.</li><li>The team teased that there's more to come for Google Home on the web, stating "additional controls" are on the way.</li><li>A Google Home member stated that there is a "vision and roadmap" behind their development of the app and its features, but specifics weren't stated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Home team held an AMA (ask me anything) on Reddit, answering questions about its web availability and devices. While many users took the opportunity to complain, the Google Home team provided a bit of insight into the future of the platform.</p><p>Several product and engineering managers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest/?share_id=D99o-RHMpgSW0jKzLr3MR&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1">were on deck to reply</a> to users&apos; questions as things got underway. One user had a lengthy post, asking questions about Google Home&apos;s controls on the web, devices, and the removal of Assistance in favor of Gemini. Jacqueline, a product manager, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kx16o89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">responded by stating</a>, "We&apos;re working on bringing additional device control to Google Home for web."</p><p>The team didn&apos;t have much more to say about what sort of controls users could expect, but the new additions would appear in a Public Preview first. The Home team declined to comment any further about AI in its devices.</p><p>Topics turned into questioning about when Google would bring an offline mode to the Home app. Team member Daniel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwztl8z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">said</a>, "We&apos;re focusing first on routing more of your interactions locally (thanks to Matter!) to get the reliability and latency benefits." The post added that once Google feels it has a "significant" amount of your traffic operating locally, it will shift to focus on bringing "powerful" offline capabilities through the app.</p><p>Cohesiveness, or lack thereof, was another talking point for one user. Google Home&apos;s Daniel took the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kwzx5cr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">lead once more</a>, stating that the team has a "vision and roadmap" to help them navigate the process of software and product development.</p><p>Daniel mentioned the Home team&apos;s need to create a brand new UI experience to accommodate its new camera protocols and acknowledged that it could cause "frustration and pain" for the user.</p><p>We&apos;re still left wondering what Google Home&apos;s current roadmap is for app development, as they did not share further.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/were_the_team_behind_the_latest_updates_to_nest">We’re the team behind the latest updates to Nest devices and Google Home for web - ask us anything!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Despite the Home team declining to divulge its roadmap, mentioning the Matter connectivity standard for smart homes is a good starting point. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-2-upgrade-details">Matter 1.2 upgrade</a> launched in October 2023, bringing with it support for nine device types. Moreover, the Matter standard helps smart devices communicate with one another (locally) instead of running through a company like Google.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest Google Home update arrived for its web app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-for-web-getting-camera-history-and-clip-editor-in-new-update">earlier in March</a>. The update brought camera history and a clip editor to web users, which were highly requested features the community pushed for. The latter enabled users to chop down and save clips that their cameras have recorded for other uses.</p><p>The update also brought the availability of the Public Preview testing space for Home web users to test new features.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Meta/Oculus Quest 2</a> may be a bit outdated at this point, but it still ranks among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> that money can buy. Now just $199.99, the Quest 2 boasts an ultra-immersive 90Hz display, 6GB of RAM, and up to 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. You'll also get access to nearly all of the same <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> that are available on the Meta Quest 3, but at a much lower cost. </p>
<p>Pick up this acclaimed headset from Best Buy and you'll also get over $150 worth of free extras, including a pair of Logitech headphones that'll make your VR experience feel much more immersive and lifelike. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/meta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb-gray/6473553.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="82cedc8d-4af7-4b43-8218-9ba14152e29f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>I&apos;m no mathematician, but lets break down the numbers here.

Add it all up and you&apos;re looking at over $150 worth of free stuff, and that&apos;s without counting the Meta Quest 2&apos;s new low price. No kidding. It&apos;s no wonder we&apos;re calling this the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-oculus-quest-2-prices-and-deals">best Meta Quest 2 deal</a> of the month.</p><p>Sure, the Quest 2 is a bit old at this point, but it&apos;s an excellent choice if you&apos;re new to the world of VR gaming and you want to try out a great headset without a major investment. That said, if money is no object, you&apos;ll definitely want to upgrade to the newer Meta Quest 3 for $499. Looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oculus-quest-2-vs-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 vs Meta Quest 3</a>, the Quest 3 improves upon its predecessor in all of the areas where it counts, from speed and responsiveness to its lighter construction. </p><p>But if you&apos;re a casual gamer and you just want a fun VR experience with access to loads of games, this Quest 2 deal is for you. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s Care Plus team has started notifying users of the impending availability of unlimited battery repairs for eligible devices and certain plans.</p><p>An email received by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-care-plus-battery-repair-3429615/">Android Authority</a> shows that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/samsung-care-plus/">Samsung Care Plus</a> is planning to introduce support for unlimited battery repairs in May. The email states that those who have purchased Samsung Care Plus with Loss and Theft protection or the standard Care Plus plan are eligible for unlimited battery repairs.</p><p>More importantly, your device is only eligible for a battery repair if its charging capacity drops below 79%. Samsung states this can be confirmed through a diagnostics check and if it&apos;s below that line, your battery will be replaced. Of course, Samsung will only handle repairs during an active coverage period.</p><p>Speaking of, the email adds that users can mail in their devices or walk into a Samsung store for battery repairs.

<p>Walk-ins for battery repairs are a welcome sight as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-batteries-plus-expanded-partnership">expanded its partnership</a> with Batteries Plus last October. The expansion saw 35 stores across the U.S. convert into Samsung Authorization Service Centers. This allows consumers to enter and speak to Galaxy device professionals for insight into what&apos;s wrong with their devices. Moreover, the partnership included support for foldable device repairs.</p><p>But this email notifying users of unlimited battery repair goes hand-in-hand with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-brings-back-a-battery-feature-it-had-previously-removed">returning One UI feature</a>. One UI 6.1 has brought back the "since last charge" screen, giving users more insight into what apps are soaking up power and how long their battery has left. The "Today" page has remained, letting users check in and see how apps affect their battery daily.</p>

<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp for iOS update brings a handy new feature to the messaging platform.</li><li>Users, post the update, can double tap the screen to skip/rewind a video for ten seconds.</li><li>The feature is widely popular on YouTube and Twitter, and chances to venture into the Android version of WhatsApp are likely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has a new nifty feature rolling out to iOS users this week that should make video watching on the messaging platform hassle-free.</p><p>Early this week, WhatsApp on iOS, bearing a <strong>24.6.77</strong> version number, brought in a new handy feature that allows users to quickly forward or rewind a video by double-tapping on the edge of their screens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-for-ios-24-6-77-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>). The feature has been quite popular in leading <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps#section-best-video-streaming-apps">video apps</a> like YouTube and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps#section-best-social-media-apps">social media apps</a> like X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="XHcn5SZ6eRtJH4Jk47crhj" name="whatsapp-ios-update-24677.jpg" alt="WhatsApp new iOS update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHcn5SZ6eRtJH4Jk47crhj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the playback of videos, double tapping on either edge of the video would fast-forward or rewind the video by ten seconds.</p><p>For now, the feature is official on WhatsApp for iOS. The feature&apos;s rollout to Android devices is still unclear; however, the video control was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-24-6-whats-new/">featured earlier</a> in WhatsApp beta for Android in November 2023. It was seen as functional in the beta version, albeit the feature didn&apos;t see the light of day in the stable version of the app.</p><p>With iOS users now receiving the functionality, we could soon see it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets, too. It would be one handy feature to see amongst several others that have popped up over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Some of the latest WhatsApp features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-to-add-one-minute-video-status-updates">include</a> Instagram-like longer status updates, which are also found in the app&apos;s latest beta for Android devices. Another feature seen in the works is the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-prepares-optional-link-preview">hide link previews</a> shared in messages on WhatsApp.</p><p>WhatsApp on Android is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-testing-transcribe-voice-notes-feature">testing the ability</a> to transcribe voice notes within the chats, which is very helpful in certain scenarios where users are unable to hear the voice messages and want to read them instead. The interesting aspect of the feature is that they are still end-to-end encrypted and don&apos;t leave the device. Notably, the feature is already live on the iOS platform.</p>

<p>Samsung is the brand to beat when it comes to timely software updates, and the South Korean manufacturer has done an incredible job in this area over the last three years. It is also the only brand other than Google that rolls out monthly security updates, and what&apos;s particularly great is that Samsung lavishes the same level of attention on its mid-range Galaxy A series as its flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Z portfolio.</p><p>With Samsung guaranteeing four Android OS updates to its flagships and Galaxy A devices, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> over the last three years are eligible to receive the stable One UI 6 update. </p><p>Like last year, the stable build will roll out to the Galaxy S23 series, followed by the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, and then make its way to last year&apos;s flagships and then the Galaxy A series. Here&apos;s the full breakdown of Samsung phones that will make the switch to the Android 14-based One UI 6:</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N9VwacMCg3Z2Vx4bv9todm" name="one-ui-6-2.jpg" alt="One UI 6 full-size notification pane against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N9VwacMCg3Z2Vx4bv9todm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 6 beta is slowly going out to more users, so if you&apos;re interested in trying out the latest features before they&apos;re officially released, now is the time to do so. That said, the beta is still rough around the edges, and I ran into a lot of bugs and crashes in the week I used it. So if you&apos;re thinking of using it on your primary phone, you should hold off until Samsung rolls out a few updates. </p><p>As for the new features, there&apos;s a lot to talk about, with Samsung making several changes to the visual design. The most noticeable is the notification pane, which now has two large toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that sit above the rest of the quick toggles. This makes it easy to access those two radios, and while they have large tiles, they&apos;re not as massive as the Pixel. </p><p>I like the change, and the best part is that a single pull-down still surfaces the six toggles — you only see the larger tiles with the shade fully down. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6dxkNeWDxpHhJG7U97zSSm" name="one-ui-6-1.jpg" alt="One UI 6 notification pane with six toggles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dxkNeWDxpHhJG7U97zSSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s what Samsung has to say about it: </p><p>"One UI 6 makes a compelling first impression with its beautiful simplicity. Many elements have been tweaked to create a more modern look and feel, such as the impactful new default font and the new emojis on Samsung Keyboard. The Quick Panel has been revamped with an updated layout that makes it effortless for users to access their most used features."</p><p>"It is easier than ever to adjust screen visibility on the go as the brightness control bar is available by default in the compact Quick Panel. Furthermore, there is also a new instant access option to the full Quick Panel, providing faster access to settings with a single downward swipe at the upper right corner of the screen."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wpwmqd9RdN6Ct9qGZBkEWo" name="one-ui-6-9.jpg" alt="Lock screen customization in One UI 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wpwmqd9RdN6Ct9qGZBkEWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another key change is the ability to customize the lock screen based on Modes and Routines, so you can set up different lock screens according to time and day. There&apos;s more customizability to the lock screen itself when it comes to styles and fonts. </p><p>One UI 6 also gets a new camera widget that lets you launch a particular mode with just a press of a button. So if you like to take portraits, just create a widget, put it on your home screen, and press that to launch the camera in that mode: </p><p>"One UI 6 is loaded with great new ways for users to customize the Galaxy experience based on their own habits and preferences, so it feels even more like an extension of themselves. For instance, it is now possible to set different lock screens according to specific Modes and Routines, such as a calming photo of a forest in Sleep Mode. There is also a new custom camera widget, which lets users preselect a camera mode and a storage location — like portrait mode and a folder just for headshots."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kAiqR4Xh2DsAVU7x4GAJym" name="one-ui-6-4.jpg" alt="One UI 6 settings page with new font" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kAiqR4Xh2DsAVU7x4GAJym.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s also a new system-wide font that looks cleaner than its predecessor. The settings page still looks the same, but the battery section has been moved into its own sub-menu. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FBuRTH4No6PxsquibzXwN" name="one-ui-6-11.jpg" alt="Media player card in One UI 6 notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FBuRTH4No6PxsquibzXwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of visual changes, there&apos;s a large media player card that sits in the notification shade, and like the Pixels, it has a squiggly seek bar along with large album art. </p><p>These are just some of the changes that are live in One UI 6 right now; Samsung is sure to add more features to the Android 14-based build over the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Predicting when your phone will get the One UI 6 update is down to a few factors, like the duration of the beta program. Traditionally, Samsung has offered beta builds for just over two months before rolling out the stable update, but with One UI 6, it&apos;s still too early to talk about the stable release.</p><p>What we know is that Samsung tends to roll out the stable update to its Galaxy S and Galaxy Z phones before the end of the year, so you won&apos;t have to wait too long to switch to the Android 14-based One UI 6 on your phone. I&apos;ll share further details once Samsung confirms plans for the One UI 6 stable build, but for now, if you&apos;ve got an eligible device, the best way to take a look at all the new features is by installing the One UI 6 beta.</p>

Its Accentum line focuses on more affordable and mid-range headphones aiming to deliver a similar audio experience without paying a premium for the best, represented by the Momentum line.</p><p>The Accentum Plus Wireless headphones are an update over the previous Accentum, with the "Plus" meaning a set of changes and upgrades. The two share a lot in common, so the differences won&apos;t be major, so are they worth the extra money you have to pay for them? Let&apos;s find out!</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-accentum-plus-wireless-price-and-availability"><span>Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless: Price and availability</span></h2>

<p>Sennheiser launched the Accentum Plus headphones in February 2024. They start at $230, putting them in mid-range territory among both its own and competitor headphones. They come in black and white.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sennheiser-accentum-plus-wireless-what-s-good"><span>Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless: What's good</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rJiNiPpccfx8HRTRvEHckd" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-case.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus inside carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rJiNiPpccfx8HRTRvEHckd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s worth pointing out that the Accentum Plus headphones are a little different from the Accentum, a pair Sennheiser launched only months prior to these. The key differences with the Plus are you get a 3.5mm jack for wired playback (though you can also do it through the USB-C port as well), touch-sensitive controls on both earcups, support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec, and you get a nice carrying case for easier transport and protection.</p><p>Otherwise, the two use many of the same internal components, including the 37mm drivers, so they will technically sound the same, except aptX Adaptive gives you hi-res audio from sources offering it, along with personalized sound you can&apos;t get with the regular pair. Other nuances also apply to separate the two, particularly through Sennheiser&apos;s Smart Control app, which I&apos;ll touch on further down.</p><p>A lack of physical buttons and little in the way of design treatments give the Accentum Plus a pretty bland appearance, but that&apos;s not surprising for Sennheiser. Even the company&apos;s flagship and high-end headphones lack unique styling, so if you&apos;re looking for something flashy, even the white variant may not cut it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="7kmEfrazZQJNbZi2dtmwrb" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7kmEfrazZQJNbZi2dtmwrb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Smart Control app offers a fair level of customization worth diving into to get the most out of the Accentum Plus. It&apos;s easy to choose any of the EQ presets or create your own, but I would argue that Sound Personalization takes it to another level. My one gripe with it is that Sennheiser forces you to open an account to access it (which also requires data access for some reason), but the company claims the sound profile you create can apply to all of its headphones and earbuds supporting the feature.</p><p>The process doesn&apos;t feel intricate but it manages to breathe life into the flatter default sound signature, and to my ears, it sounds a lot more like what I would expect from Sennheiser at this price. Don&apos;t expect these headphones to hit the resonance and clarity of the company&apos;s best, though they won&apos;t disappoint once you tinker with the tools available.</p><p>There&apos;s a balance here that only gets easier to appreciate the more you listen to your favorite tunes. Highs and mids don&apos;t feel constrained or over the top, while bass complements both nicely without muffling out the rest of the audio spectrum. Unlike its flagships, Sennheiser knows mid-range headphones like these compete with many others in a similar price range, so the bass response will be more noticeable here off the bat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.58%;"><img id="BqErTpXG3cHR9o3chZBweb" name="Sennheiser-Momentum-Accentum-Plus-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum Accentum Plus screenshots from Smart Control app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqErTpXG3cHR9o3chZBweb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1466" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Active noise cancelation (ANC) is either manual or dynamic, leaving the microphones to deal with background noise as it comes. Or you can just turn it on manually and leave it, as is. While it&apos;s okay, the ANC isn&apos;t going to feel stellar in every situation, where it may struggle to sufficiently dampen the heavy rumble of a subway train and screeching tracks, for instance. It&apos;s on par with what a mid-range pair of headphones should be, so you can rely on it to do its job well enough in most situations.</p><p>It helps that they&apos;re pretty comfortable to wear as well, fashioning a tight seal around the ear to keep all audio from seeping out. There&apos;s a sizeable cushion on the headband to help with longer listening periods; I didn&apos;t have to adjust them on my head all that often. Speaking of which, if you want to automate things a little more, you can use the Sound Zones feature to set up profiles that apply based on the ambient noise around you. This way, ANC shifts depending on how loud or quiet it is around you.</p><p>Touch controls on the right earcup are generally responsive, thanks in large part to the larger surface area. Swipe forward to skip a track, backward to go back one. Swipe up to raise the volume and down to lower it. Tap once to play/pause, or twice to enable/disable ANC. Look inside the right cup and you see a convenient wear sensor that automatically pauses playback when you remove the headphones and plays when you put them back on.</p>

<p>If you choose to listen to audio through a wired connection — be it USB-C or the 3.5mm Aux-in jack — you will get the same audio quality, for the most part. It&apos;s just that the other connections won&apos;t apply, including multipoint, which uses Bluetooth to stay connected to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>Battery life holds up well throughout, reaching the 50 hours Sennheiser claims on one charge. More impressively, I hit that number with a minor bump in volume while I listened to tunes and podcasts using Sound Personalization. A quick 10-minute charge in a pinch can deliver up to five hours of playback.</p>

<p>The Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless headphones sound good for their price, but there is a slightly elevated response at the high end of the spectrum that could introduce sibilance into certain tracks. You may notice it with some genres more than others, like how the pitches you normally hear in rock music have a sharper finish. Subjective as it may be, I suspect it will be noticeable in a majority of the EQ presets and Sound Personalization settings available.</p><p>If you&apos;re thinking of wearing them for a run or at the gym, I should warn you that the Accentum Plus headphones have no IP rating, so no official protection. That&apos;s not to say that they&apos;ll fall apart or die out with minimal water contact, but there&apos;s no telling how durable they might be with repeated exposure to rain or sweat.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> include a number of options, most of which will cost more than the Accentum Plus. Among them are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sennheiser-momentum-4-wireless">Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless</a> headphones, a sonic upgrade with better ANC — and the price to match. The regular Accentum headphones miss some of the features noted above, but also sell for considerably less if you&apos;re cool with what they don&apos;t have.</p><p>Outside of Sennheiser&apos;s own options, you could consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/skullcandy-crusher-anc-2-review">Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2</a>, especially if you want more bass and are okay with sound that isn&apos;t quite as clear as the Accentum Plus. Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-space-q45-review">Anker Soundcore Space Q45</a> headphones are much cheaper and offer real bang for the buck, including a deep supporting app with plenty of customization.</p><p>There aren&apos;t many headphones with IP ratings, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/treblab-z7-pro-review">Treblab Z7 Pro</a> headphones are good cheaper alternatives to the Sennheiser Accentum Plus Wireless in that aspect. You get IPX4 splashproofing, both wired and wireless playback, touch controls, and a surprisingly full-bodied sound. The fit is comfortable and you get 45 hours of playback.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good, balanced sound</li>
  <li>You want extra customization and personalization</li>
  <li>You want a comfortable fit</li>
  <li>You like having a carrying case</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want something more rugged</li>
  <li>You want something bass-heavy</li>
  <li>You have a tighter budget</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The Accentum Plus Wireless are really the next best thing to getting the more premium Momentum 4 Wireless within Sennheiser&apos;s lineup. Mind you, you could get the regular Accentum and still get much of what&apos;s available here, even if you lose out on the case, wired playback, and better sound quality. The size and fit are otherwise exactly the same.</p><p>Either way, the Accentum Plus Wireless shine when you customize them in the Smart Control app, potentially pushing them further than you might otherwise expect.</p>
