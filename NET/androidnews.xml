<p>Powered by a newer and more energy-efficient SoC, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a top-of-the-line Android tablet that can make quick work of even the most resource-intensive tasks. It comes with an anti-reflective display that helps in reducing glare, and you get a lot of AI-based tools to play around with as well.</p></p>

<p>It may be a bit dated at this point, but the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra continues to be an extremely capable Android tablet that can handle everything from split-screen multitasking to photo/video editing with little to no effort. Its Dynamic AMOLED panel is a sight to behold, and you get S Pen support too.</p></p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s devices have always been at the forefront of the Android tablet product segment, and the newly introduced Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is no exception. The uber-premium tablet is specifically designed for resource-heavy workflows and on-the-go productivity—offering everything from powerhouse hardware to full S Pen support—to help you do just that. Of course, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra has all of that as well, but the latest version does come with a few improvements over the last-gen model.</p><p>So, what are all these upgrades, and how significant are they? More importantly, if you already have the previous-gen model, should you even care?</p><p>Read on, as we take a comparative look at Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra and answer those questions.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Design and display</h2>
<p>When viewed side by side, the two tablets are nearly impossible to tell apart. Except for being a little lighter and a tad slimmer, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is exactly the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>. You still get the same well-built aluminum chassis with flat sides, a dual-lens rear camera system, as well as an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. Other standout features—from the crisp quad-speaker array to the magnetic S Pen charging strip at the back—have also been carried forward from the last-gen model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4hQSUowGGVo2sp7twKutz6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S9-Ultra-display-02.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hQSUowGGVo2sp7twKutz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip over the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, and you&apos;ll notice it&apos;s a similar story. The tablet&apos;s business side is all about a gargantuan 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen, having a resolution of 2960x1848 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. It&apos;s exactly the same superb display—complete with vibrant colors and great viewing angles—as the one on the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, but with one key difference.</p><p>The panel now comes with an anti-reflective coating (introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>) that helps a lot in reducing glare and enhancing overall visibility, as noted by Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on" target="_blank">brief hands-on experience</a> with the device. You also get fairly slim (for a tablet) uniform bezels on all sides, with only the notch for the dual-lens front camera setup breaking up the symmetry.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-hardware-and-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Hardware and cameras</h2>
<p>Complementing the stunning exterior of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra are its top-tier innards, which are easily the best you can find in any Android-based tablet available in the market right now. The flagship slate is driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing" target="_blank">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus chipset</a> that—according to Samsung—delivers an 18 percent boost and a 28 percent jump in CPU and GPU performance, respectively. While we&apos;ll only be able to test out these claims once we review the tablet, it&apos;s worth noting that the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC powering the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra continues to be capable of handling everything you throw at it without breaking a sweat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other hardware specifications remain unchanged, with both tablets offering up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. And if you need even more space, you&apos;ll be happy to know that the good ol&apos; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android" target="_blank">microSD card</a> slot is still here.</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a total of four cameras—two at the front and two on the rear — and all of them have been carried over from the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. The rear camera system is comprised of a 13MP wide-angle sensor and an 8MP ultrawide unit. On the other hand, the front camera setup is comprised of a 12MP wide-angle sensor and a 12MP ultrawide unit. There&apos;s support for 4K video recording as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yFiieAHbWHeTXM3zVuSwD7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S9-Ultra-multitasking-01.jpg" alt="Multitasking on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and using the S Pen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yFiieAHbWHeTXM3zVuSwD7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A tablet—especially one that&apos;s this big—may not be everyone&apos;s first choice when it comes to capturing photos and videos, but it&apos;s good to have the option. We also think the overall quality is going to be more than decent, even if it doesn&apos;t come anywhere close to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> out there.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-software-accessory-support-and-battery-life-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Software, accessory support, and battery life</h2>
<p>Being the latest model, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra comes with Android 14 preinstalled. While that&apos;s expected, what&apos;s important is the One UI 6.1.1 overlay, which makes it Samsung&apos;s first tablet to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-ai" target="_blank">Galaxy AI</a> out of the box. Optimized for big screen(s), Galaxy AI introduces features like enhanced note-taking with auto summarization, split-view editing, and PDF translation. Apart from those, you also have goodies such as Google&apos;s &apos;Circle to Search&apos; and generative photo editing. Needless to say, all these AI-powered tools will eventually come to the last-gen model too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-side-profile-in-case.jpg" alt="Side profile view of Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GifpZtZdukKgDiB8zxcv2a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the one thing that might just give the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra an edge over the previous-gen model is software support, as it&apos;s very much possible that it will be covered by the same excellent update policy as Samsung&apos;s newest flagship phones. Conversely, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra—which was launched with Android 13—is only eligible for four years of updates.</p><p>Now let&apos;s talk about accessories! Yeah, the bundled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-samsung-galaxy-tab-models-support-s-pen" target="_blank">S Pen</a> is great, but Samsung is also offering a number of accessories (e.g., rugged cases, keyboard covers) for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra through its online storefront. And the best part is that nearly all of them are backwards compatible with the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="anKJbR5PvnxeLuSxrVWhqK" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-dex-mode-setup-16x9.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/anKJbR5PvnxeLuSxrVWhqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 11,200mAh battery of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra remains unchanged, as does the 45W fast wired charging support. That being said, the use of newer and more power-efficient internals could result in better endurance as compared to the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-vs-tab-s9-ultra-should-you-upgrade-2">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra vs. Tab S9 Ultra: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>There&apos;s no denying that the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a> you can get today. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, even if it&apos;s a bit old at this point. Sure, the refreshed anti-reflective display and the new MediaTek hardware are awesome, but these are only minor updates. Moreover, now that the Tab S10 Ultra is here, it&apos;s only a matter of time before the Tab S9 Ultra sees a reduction in its price(s).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JGoekp7KnQR7mzxRrYts9V" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-google-gemini-1.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JGoekp7KnQR7mzxRrYts9V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Our suggestion is simple! If you&apos;re planning to get a new premium tablet and money is no object, go ahead and get the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. You&apos;ll get the newest thing in town, along with slightly faster performance and longer software support. However, if you already have the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, an upgrade just isn&apos;t worth it. Even if you decide to take advantage of the pre-order deals and trade in your last-gen tablet (in mint condition), you&apos;ll have to pay $400 out of your pocket, so it&apos;s better to save your money.</p>

That&apos;s no longer the case, as we&apos;re getting not one but two new and exciting Chromebooks. </p><p>These devices were announced alongside a slew of new changes slated to arrive on ChromeOS in the coming weeks and months. Thankfully, I was able to spend some time with the new Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" and the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and I am here to share some thoughts about my experience.</p>
<h2 id="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-2">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kjPbR7AB56WRwLg8oVP3nC" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-11.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 tablet separated from Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kjPbR7AB56WRwLg8oVP3nC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2020, Lenovo released the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review">Chromebook Duet</a>, a ChromeOS tablet that endeared itself to many. This remained true until its successor was introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Chromebook Duet 3</a>, which launched in 2022. It too became an instant fan-favorite, offering improvements across the board.</p><p>Fast-forward to now, and Lenovo is back again with the Chromebook Duet 11. Unlike the jump between the original Duet and the Duet 3, the changes this time around are much more subtle. For one, there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lenovo-duet-5-chromebook-review" target="_blank">Duet 5</a> successor to speak of, which comes as a bit of a surprise but seemingly proves that the masses prefer smaller tablets.</p><p>Notably, Google pointed out that the Duet is the "best-selling Chromebook of all time," which is downright impressive. Needless to say, it&apos;s safe to assume Lenovo and Google hope the new Duet 11 continues to sell like hotcakes.</p><p>If you&apos;re wondering about specs, we&apos;ve got you covered:</p>

<p>After spending some time with the Duet 11, I have a feeling that Lenovo has another winner on its hands. The design is fairly similar to the Duet 3, with a few key differences. The first thing that I noticed, besides what was on the screen, was that Lenovo rearranged the ports with the Duet 11.</p><p>There&apos;s still a USB-C port on the left, but this is now joined by the 3.5mm headphone jack, something that was a surprising omission from the Duet 3. Lenovo also moved the USB-C port on the right side to the top of the Duet 11, likely just in an attempt to make plugging in USB-C hubs or other peripherals more accessible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yZhVuR8YufGBwEnwgj7ATo" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-2.jpg" alt="Camera toggle on the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yZhVuR8YufGBwEnwgj7ATo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another change that surprised me comes in the form of the new physical privacy switch at the top. This is one feature that has become a bit of a mainstay with "traditional" Chromebooks, so it&apos;s a nice surprise to see it land on the Duet 11.</p><p>If you decide to pick up the Duet 11 for yourself, you&apos;ll be happy to know that Lenovo includes its Case with Keyboard and Kickstand. This makes it much easier to start using out of the box, but the same can&apos;t be said about Lenovo&apos;s stylus.</p><p>The Chromebook Duet 11 <em>is</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-chromebook">USI 2.0</a> compliant, and thankfully, we don&apos;t have to worry about any issues <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-usi-2-stylus">like we saw with the Duet 3</a>. However, I can&apos;t help but feel as though Lenovo missed an opportunity by not including the stylus in the box. Instead, you&apos;ll either have to pick one up for yourself or rely on one that you already have.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TggoFNEhpsdT5oxjZ2KCLE" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-13.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TggoFNEhpsdT5oxjZ2KCLE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area of improvement that was pointed out is that palm rejection has been greatly improved when writing or drawing on the Duet 11. Apparently, some of this is being done on the OS level, meaning that the ML model changes should offer improvements to all Chromebooks featuring stylus support.</p><p>It&apos;s also worth noting that Google is partnering with Goodnotes, as you&apos;ll be able to get a three-month subscription to the app for free. Adding even more credence to the idea that Lenovo should have included a stylus in the box.</p><p>Nevertheless, I&apos;m still happy to see the Case with Keyboard and Kickstand comes in the box, while also offering a slight redesign compared to the Duet 3&apos;s combo. Notably, Lenovo ditched the fabric finish from the previous version, opting instead for a rubber/silicone texture.</p><p>The keyboard has not changed much. Lenovo uses a mechanical trackpad and chiclet-style keys. The typing experience is still one of my favorites, even if it lacks the changes offered by the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EqqBhzA9ZHiZE2WZHMwRUF" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-hands-on-14.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 standing vertically" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EqqBhzA9ZHiZE2WZHMwRUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the Kickstand, there&apos;s been a tweak to the design in an attempt to make the Duet a bit more functional. Along with being used to prop up the tablet in your lap or on a desk in a horizontal orientation, you can also adjust the kickstand and use the Duet 11 vertically. It&apos;s not exactly the most dramatic change, but it is definitely a quality-of-life improvement.</p><p>Speaking of which, if you do decide to pick up Lenovo&apos;s USI 2.0 stylus pen, it still magnetically attaches to the back of the Duet 11. Lenovo also tweaked the stylus cutout on the back shell to try to keep the stylus from accidentally falling off when sliding the Duet 11 in and out of your bag.</p><p>I didn&apos;t realize this until later, but I am kind of disappointed that the Duet 11 doesn&apos;t fall under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-chromebooks">Chromebook Plus</a> umbrella. The obvious reason is because of Lenovo&apos;s decision to rely on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/day-in-the-life-acer-chromebook-514">Kompanio 828</a>, as opposed to an Intel or AMD chip. Besides that, the Duet 11 has everything else needed to meet the minimum hardware specs for Chromebook Plus.</p>

<p>That&apos;s not to say that the Duet 11 won&apos;t be performant, but it will miss out on some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">new Chromebook Plus features</a> that were also announced. On the bright side, Google is bringing more and more features to non-Plus models, which is great for not only the Duet 11 but all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a> owners.</p><p>Pricing for the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 comes in at $349, and it will be available sometime this month.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-2">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4bKntNPEU3qMpJ8fWhsJR" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-hands-on-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bKntNPEU3qMpJ8fWhsJR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably the more exciting announcement to come is that Samsung is getting back into Chromebooks in a big way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/we-could-see-a-new-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-in-the-near-future">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> is finally official, bringing with it a few major changes and features that aim to put it above the rest. </p><p>Starting off, this is being touted as the "thinnest Chromebook Plus ever," as it&apos;s just 11.8mm thick. Another benefit of this is that the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is also incredibly light, weighing just 2.58 pounds. </p>

<p>When hearing these numbers, the first thing that came to mind was whether there would be keyboard (or deck) flex to contend with. I&apos;m happy to say that this won&apos;t be an issue for anyone. Even when holding it with my index finger and thumb in one corner and the laptop open, there wasn&apos;t any discernible flex. </p><p>It&apos;s great to see, as that is usually one sticking point with quite a few different Chromebook models. But I&apos;m happy to see that Samsung managed to work some magic to squash any potential concerns. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vHiLot7v6dYaYiNafd3qo3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-hands-on-10.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vHiLot7v6dYaYiNafd3qo3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of the reason why I was worried about the potential for deck flex is that the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is packing a 15.6-inch OLED display. With larger laptops, there&apos;s usually a compromise to be made <em>somewhere</em>, but I didn&apos;t get the same feeling in my time with Samsung&apos;s upcoming offering.</p><p>The display itself looks just as crisp and clean as you would expect from a premium Samsung product. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it&apos;s the same panel that the company used with the Galaxy Book 4 360.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bHy7nZGPXf3BT8i5BfMKom" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-hands-on-20.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bHy7nZGPXf3BT8i5BfMKom.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of performance, I don&apos;t see very many issues, as the Galaxy Chromebook Plus is powered by the Intel Core 3 100U. This is part of Intel&apos;s Raptor Lake series, which seems to perform quite well on Windows, so I surmise the same will be true with ChromeOS. </p><p>Paired with the Core 3 100U, Samsung includes 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which again should be <em>fine</em> for the majority of people. My biggest sticking point is that it seems Samsung is only offering a single configuration. So if you want more RAM and/or more storage, you&apos;re just out of luck. </p><p>Along with being the "thinnest," the Galaxy Chromebook Plus also takes home the distinction of being "the first" in another major way. Much like we saw earlier this year when Microsoft mandated a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Copilot key for Windows laptops</a>, Google is now introducing a new Quick Insert key. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8T3yn4eTtDxws42CdMG4u5" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-hands-on-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8T3yn4eTtDxws42CdMG4u5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, instead of being used to invoke Copilot or Gemini, pushing the Quick Insert key will bring up a drop-down menu on your screen. From here, you can access a variety of different tools and features. These include things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/embargo-222-12pm-et-google-chrome-update-brings-help-me-write-and-generative-ai-to-any-website">Help Me Write</a> and other Gemini-powered features. But it doesn&apos;t stop there, as you can view your browsing history, look for a specific file in Google Drive, or just insert an emoji.</p><p>I would argue that an even more important benefit is that the Quick Insert menu isn&apos;t confined to just being available with Google&apos;s apps. It&apos;s been integrated at the OS level, meaning that you can take advantage of it regardless of what you&apos;re currently doing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nUjzd6aY2fdj4e4YZYyFB3" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-hands-on-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUjzd6aY2fdj4e4YZYyFB3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as I have a tendency to switch between windows full of a variety of tabs, I can&apos;t wait to get my hands on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus to put the Quick Insert key to the test. You might be wondering whether this is coming to other Chromebook models, and there&apos;s both good news and bad. </p><p>The "bad" news is that the Quick Insert key will only be available with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus for now. The good news is actually twofold: Google has confirmed that the Quick Insert key will be available on future Chromebook Plus models. </p><p>If you&apos;re feeling a bit left out, don&apos;t. The Quick Insert menu will appear when using the <strong>Launcher Key + F</strong> keyboard combination. Part of what makes this so exciting is that even though you might not have the fancy new Quick Insert key, Google is still implementing a brand-new feature in a way that everyone can enjoy. </p>

<p>In recent years, we&apos;ve seen varying examples of what a premium Chromebook looks like. HP held that title with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-elite-dragonfly-chromebook-review">Elite Dragonfly Chromebook</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review">Dragonfly Pro Chromebook</a>. However, with HP seemingly bowing out of the high-end market, this opens the door for some competition. </p><p>Acer and ASUS are already there with the Chromebook Plus Spin 714 and Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flip. However, there&apos;s no such thing as not enough options, and Samsung&apos;s re-entry into the space with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus comes at the perfect time.  </p><p>Pricing for the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus comes in at $699, and it will also be available sometime this month.</p>
<h2 id="a-lot-to-be-excited-about-2">A lot to be excited about</h2>

<p>The Chromebook space has been fairly quiet as of late, but there&apos;s no denying that the year is ending with a bang. We finally have a refreshed model of the best ChromeOS tablet with the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11. Meanwhile, it seems as though Samsung is looking to redefine the term "premium Chromebook" with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. </p><p>That doesn&apos;t even account for the influx of new and exciting features that are coming to ChromeOS across the board, regardless of whether you have a "regular" Chromebook or a Chromebook Plus. Keep your eyes peeled for more Chromebook content, as I hope to get both of these devices in for review just in time for the 2024 holiday shopping season. </p>

<hr>
<p>Today (Oct 1), Google is announcing the launch of a new Chromebook Plus and a compact Chromebook from Lenovo.</p><p>The first of the debuts today is Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Chromebook Plus. As detailed in a press release, Google states the laptop offers a 15.6-inch OLED display. However, the highlight of this computer is its "ultra-portable, thin" design. The post states the laptop weighs 2.5 lbs and is less than an inch thick, coming in at 11.8mm.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s latest Galaxy Chromebook Plus equips a "Quick Insert" button on its keyboard. Google states the key can deliver "instant help where you need it" if you&apos;re trying to add a link somewhere or sending an emoji/GIF. Hitting the Quick Insert key will produce a menu on the Chromebook Plus, giving you access to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">Help me write</a>" from Gemini.</p><p>Additionally, users will find a comprehensive list of sites you&apos;ve recently visited, your Google Drive information, and "tactical tools" for calculations, unit conversion, dates, and more.</p><p>While the Quick Insert key is unique and exclusive to Samsung&apos;s new Galaxy Chromebook Plus, Google states other laptops will gain it differently. "In the future," existing Chromebook users can use the <strong>Launcher Key + F</strong> shortcut to access Quick Insert&apos;s menu.</p>

<p>Internally, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus can offer an estimated 13 hours on a full charge. The Intel Core 3 100U Raptor Lake-R powers its processing and computing methods. Additionally, users will have 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS storage to handle all their data.</p><p>Aside from Gemini&apos;s "help me write" tools, the latest Chromebook Plus is picking up a host of other AI features, such as "help me read." The latter will assist users by summarizing PDFs and articles when right-clicked. Google states users can ask the AI a "follow-up" about what it summarized for extra context.</p><p>Live Translate makes its way to the laptop and is usable in Zoom meetings, YouTube livestreams, and video files. This feature supports over 100 languages and will be available once you unwrap the computer. The Chromebook Plus is also picking up the Pixel series&apos; Recorder app. Google states this AI-powered tool can help transcribe conversations alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-recorder-app-speaker-labels-update">speaker labels</a>.</p><p>Lastly, the Galaxy Chromebook Plus includes a few video calling improvements, beginning with its studio-style mic. This is said to upgrade the clarity of your voice while the "built-in appearance effects" adjust your lighting to ensure you look just as crispy as you sound.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Chromebook Plus will be available on the market in October.</p>

<p>The second model to debut today (Oct 1) is Lenovo&apos;s new Chromebook Duet with an 11-inch display. The laptop&apos;s screen comes in at 2K resolution, narrow bezels, and a 16:10 aspect ratio. Internally, the laptop packs MediaTek&apos;s Kompanio 838 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage.</p><p>Lenovo&apos;s latest Chromebook features a spill-proof chassis, so you don&apos;t have to worry about that morning (or afternoon) coffee. The back of the laptop features an 8MP camera while the front delivers a 5MP lens.</p><p>This laptop separates itself from the Chromebook Plus by doubling down on portability and notetaking with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/stylus-pens-and-supplies/pens/gx81j61977">Lenovo&apos;s USI Pen 2</a> (available separately). Enhancing your handwriting is the computer&apos;s palm rejection model, which is said to help you "sketch with precision."</p><p>Users can pick up the Chromebook Duet 11" in October. Moreover, users can grab three months of Goodnotes and free digital stationary "later this month" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/perks/">on all stylus-supported devices</a>.</p>

<p>Existing Chromebooks are preparing to receive some extra updates in October, as well. AI leads the charge, and the company states Chromebooks will gain "Chat with Gemini." The AI model will be pinned "to the shelf of every Chromebook" so you won&apos;t have to visit its web-based app.</p><p>Returning to your Chromebook will produce its new "Welcome Recap" screen. Upon logging in, users will see an "overview" of what they were last doing and "suggestions" for where to continue. Google states the software may suggest that you finish your work or a reminder about a video call.</p><p>"Focus" helps users put their heads down and finish the job quickly instead of procrastinating. The feature can also activate DND (do not disturb). Additionally, users can pin important files to their home screen (Chromebook shelf).</p><p>What&apos;s more, consumers purchasing a new Chromebook will receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> for free for three months. Google Gemini Advanced, 2TB of storage, and access to Gemini in Docs, Sheets, Gmail, and more are included.</p><p>Several of Acer&apos;s Plus edition Chromebooks will also pick up AI features like "Chat with Gemini," Live Translate, "Help me read," and more. Google highlighted several of Acer&apos;s Chromebooks (and models) that will pick up Chrome Plus features through M129 and M130:</p>

<p>Although we&apos;ve already received the above list of compatible Acer Chromebooks, the fun doesn&apos;t stop there. Many of the features introduced will be making their way to either Chromebook or Chromebook Plus models over the next month or two. </p><p>Whether you&apos;re ready to upgrade to a new Chromebook, or just picked one up, there&apos;s plenty to be excited about. Not to mention that we expect these to be available ahead of the 2024 holiday shopping season, even if they aren&apos;t ready in time for the upcoming "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-is-back-next-month-faq-early-deals-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-sale">Prime Big Deal Days</a>" promotion. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have over two dozen mechanical keyboards, and my daily driver is an Angry Miao Cyberboard R4. While that particular keyboard isn&apos;t designed to be portable — it weighs 7lb — I have a decent number of Bluetooth-enabled keyboards that I usually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/ipad-pro-2022-productivity">connect to the iPad Pro</a> to write when I&apos;m not at my desk.</p><p>Most of these keyboards tend to have 65% or 75% designs, and while I usually prefer full-size switches, they tend to be bulky. That&apos;s why I was intrigued when Cherry announced it was making low-profile mechanical switches; the Corsair K100 Air was a terrific showcase, and Lofree&apos;s Flow continues to be one of the best options in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SfWUkUbiqUFYV9L6MtoUyB" name="wombat-willow-pro-16.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SfWUkUbiqUFYV9L6MtoUyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Willow Pro is a new entrant in this segment, offering a unique full-size design that is noticeably narrower than its rivals. Wombat is a sub-brand of KSI Keyboards, and the Willow Pro is an interesting choice as it combines low-profile switches with a custom full-size design. The keyboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KSI-WOMBAT-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches-Bluetooth/dp/B0D1T173QK">costs $144 on Amazon</a>, and it is available via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wombatkeyboards.com/products/willow">Wombat&apos;s website</a> as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PwMjB4JNxGspJKajZCJcSA" name="wombat-willow-pro-1.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwMjB4JNxGspJKajZCJcSA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. The Willow Pro has a grey color scheme that contrasts well with the dual-tone white and grey keys, and the yellow spacebar and arrow keys makes the design stand out a bit. The keyboard uses an aluminum top plate and a plastic base, and there are no issues with the build quality itself. There&apos;s no flex to the chassis, and after four months of use, there isn&apos;t any visible wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mgCRm9triVixppNJsxdjiA" name="wombat-willow-pro-2.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgCRm9triVixppNJsxdjiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key talking point is the unique configuration; the Willow Pro has a tall design that sees the functions and system keys located on top, with the number pad to the right. This means you get a full-size design without the keyboard taking up as much room on your desk, and while it is taller than most keyboards, it is the same width as most 75% designs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iZdfTVRM4c86GLJkXY6otC" name="wombat-willow-pro-14.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZdfTVRM4c86GLJkXY6otC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the positioning of the system keys isn&apos;t ideal. I usually reach the Delete key with my little finger as it sits to the right of the Backspace button, but in this instance, you get the number pad instead. Barring that annoyance, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the design, and it is a novel way to cram all the keys into a smaller profile.</p>

<p>What I like about the design is that the rubber feet at the bottom are magnetized, so you can easily adjust the angle. I usually prefer a six-degree angle, and while the keyboard doesn&apos;t go to that level, there&apos;s a four-degree angle with the feet raised, and it makes using the Willow Pro that much more convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nFcNVx6PhkJW37npzbMmTD" name="wombat-willow-pro-7.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFcNVx6PhkJW37npzbMmTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used several low-profile keyboards with mechanical switches, and the Willow Pro gets a lot right in this area. The keyboard uses Gateron&apos;s Red low-profile linear switch, and it is one of the best options you&apos;ll find today. The switch has a 50gf actuation with total travel of 3.0mm, and it does a great job mimicking the tactility of a full-size switch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YVhXFmyFFNwxrhqtNu4iYE" name="wombat-willow-pro-8.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YVhXFmyFFNwxrhqtNu4iYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is great in daily use, and it provides all the benefits of a linear mechanical switch without taking up as much room. The sound profile is decent, but you get a hollowness to the sound that&apos;s down to the plastic bottom case. Given what the Willow Pro costs, Wombat should have used an all-metal enclosure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YufRAR5HimV3wmpQxFRkFB" name="wombat-willow-pro-4.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YufRAR5HimV3wmpQxFRkFB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, there are no issues with using the Willow Pro. The PBT keys are durable, and they have clear legends. There is vibrant RGB lighting, but as the legends don&apos;t shine through, you get diffused lighting as standard. Like other low-profile keyboards, the switch is soldered.</p><p>You can use the Willow Pro with Windows and macOS, with additional keys included in the box. As the keyboard has Bluetooth connectivity, you can pair it to an Android phone or tablet as well, and in my usage, I connected the keyboard to my iPad Pro 13 2024 most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vf67TXPgJPQLWxpcYWV7nB" name="wombat-willow-pro-13.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vf67TXPgJPQLWxpcYWV7nB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wombat has its own software utility, and you can customize macros with relative ease. I would have preferred VIA integration instead as it allows greater flexibility, but Wombat&apos;s software isn&apos;t as clunky as other brands I used, and it has a decent level of customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdA7iScdnRvmtD5ztmvmeC" name="wombat-willow-pro-17.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdA7iScdnRvmtD5ztmvmeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only problem with the keyboard is battery life; the Willow Pro has a 1000mAh battery, and that&apos;s on the lower end of the scale as these things go. With RGB lighting enabled, the keyboard doesn&apos;t last a full day of use, and while I was able to get it go two days between charges by disabling RGB effects, that&apos;s still not good enough.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vG4VNB8aEGonZgA5NuaGGD" name="wombat-willow-pro-6.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vG4VNB8aEGonZgA5NuaGGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Willow Pro has a good design and build quality, and while full-size keyboards are an outlier these days — particularly with low-profile switches — it&apos;s good to see a manufacturer catering to that niche. If you don&apos;t mind the battery constraints, this is a great overall choice.</p>

We here at Android Central and across the Future brands wish everyone well and are hopeful that people will be able to return to a normal life sooner rather than later.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to help out victims and survivors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation.html/">you can donate to the Red Cross</a> or sign up as a volunteer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">Verizon is having an unplanned outage</a> over much of the United States including areas impacted by Hurricane Helene making communication difficult or even impossible for many. It doesn&apos;t appear that the two are connected, as people across the U.S. in unaffected areas also report issues with Verizon. That&apos;s little consolation to people trying to survive another day, though.</p><p>There are two very important things you need to know about if you&apos;re a Verizon customer: Satellite messaging and disaster roaming.</p><p>If your phone is equipped with emergency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-satellite-sos-explained">satellite services</a> like recent iPhones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, you can use it to send out a message for help. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/text-via-satellite-iphb9262f4dd/ios#:~:text=and%20Canada%20website.-,Use%20iMessage%20via%20satellite,Tap%20Use%20Messages%20via%20Satellite.">To enable and use satellite messaging on the iPhone, head here</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?hl=en">To enable and use satellite messaging on your Pixel 9, head here</a>.</p><p>With the iPhone, you can use satellite services for non-emergencies as well, so don&apos;t be afraid to text your friends and family. They want to hear from you.</p><p>I realize this may not help people who can&apos;t get connected, but if you can, visit these links and share them — especially with responders and volunteers.</p>

<p>Another important thing to know is that the state of North Carolina has enabled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless-network-resiliency-during-disasters">disaster roaming rule</a>. This means anyone with any phone can connect to any available cellular provider provided your phone has the correct network capabilities (it probably does). This means Verizon customers can connect using AT&T or T-Mobile infrastructure to make calls and send messages.</p><p>This is important because not everyone has a new phone that can connect to a satellite, especially in rural areas most affected by Hurricane Helene. The list of satellite-supported <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is unfortunately thin, but there are a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/first-spacex-satellites-launch-for-breakthrough-direct-to-cell-service-with-t-mobile?cmpid=HEIS_AF_U_HMEINTPZ_HRKGJX7WMDYBQJAS76467&clickref=1101lzJxKPUZ&publisher_id=305950">companies</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell">working</a> to make this a more ubiquitous feature across devices and carriers (Motorola even launched a device that more or less <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-defy-satellite-link">brings Satellite connectivity to any phone</a>). Hopefully, disasters such as this can help provide a bit of added urgency to get these services off the ground. Until then, we have to work with what we have.</p><p>To use disaster roaming, you simply need to go into your phone&apos;s network settings and make sure roaming is enabled. Don&apos;t worry — it&apos;s not going to cost you anything and it might get you connected in a pinch.</p>
<p>Verizon will get things sorted out in due time, but until then, some people absolutely need to be able to use their phones. Playing games and using social media can be fun, but the main purpose of your smartphone is still to be in touch with the people you care about and care about.</p><p>If you&apos;re affected by Hurricane Helene or have friends and family who are, I hope they are safe and sound. Material things can be replaced, and there should be plenty of help in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<ul><li>The Google Phone app is set for a makeover, swapping out the single call button for a new look featuring dedicated buttons for accepting and rejecting calls.</li><li>The accept button will be on the right, and the reject button on the left, unlike Samsung’s layout, which is flipped.</li><li>This feature seems to be in limited testing, so not everyone will see it right away, even if they have the latest app version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Phone app on your Android devices could be getting a fresh look soon, replacing the single button that currently shows up when you get a call.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-incoming-call-ui-test-apk-teardown-3485981/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is testing a new incoming call screen in the latest Phone app update (version 145.0.672690850), and it looks a lot like the iPhone’s call interface.</p><p>Right now, the Google Phone app uses a swipe method to manage calls—swipe up to answer, swipe down to decline. This is different from iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, which have separate green and red buttons for answering or rejecting calls. People familiar with those setups will probably find Google’s upcoming interface change more user-friendly.</p><p>Sitting above the phone button is a "Message" option that makes it easy to fire off a quick text, letting the caller know you&apos;re tied up or can’t talk at the moment.</p><p>The report shows off a screenshot of the Phone app&apos;s refreshed incoming call screen, replacing the old swipe-to-accept button with dedicated buttons for answering and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-incoming-calls">rejecting calls</a>. This shift mirrors the iPhone’s dialer and the call screens on many other Android devices, like Samsung’s.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH" name="Google-Phone-app-New-incoming-call-UI.jpg" alt="New Google Phone app interface for incoming calls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="360" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iDeepak_Sharma / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The color-coded buttons make the interface easier to use, providing quick visual cues that help users respond faster, especially in busy situations.</p><p>To make things easier to reach, the accept button is on the right side of the interface, while the reject button is on the left. In contrast, Samsung takes a different approach, with the accept button on the left and the reject button on the right.</p><p>It’s hard to say how many people are seeing this feature since it looks like it’s just being tested with a small group of users who updated to the latest app version.</p><p>Google appears to be rolling out the new incoming call screen UI with a server-side toggle, so even if you’ve got the latest Phone app version, you might not spot this feature just yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many Quest 3S games will have graphical enhancements over the Quest 2?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>As of fall 2024, there are nearly 100 Meta Quest 2 games we know of with specific Quest 3 and 3S patches for improved performance and graphics, and the total number could be higher. Plus, there are dozens of Quest 3S games with mixed-reality modes that look much worse with Quest 2 passthrough.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, your games library will have faster loading times by default. However, some developers patch their games to fully exploit the extra power for higher refresh rates, new textures, better lighting and shadows, and other visual upgrades that the Quest 2 couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Meta confirmed in its <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-3s-announced-connect-2024" target="_blank">Connect 2024 blog post</a> that any "games ... that received Quest 3-specific performance updates will also work day one on Quest 3S, which means you’ll benefit from the same upgraded visuals and faster load times."</p>
<p>We also spoke with Meta VP Mark Rabkin at Meta Connect 2024 about this, and he confirmed that there is "100% compatibility between the 3S and the 3" in terms of game performance.</p></article></section>

<p>By default, the Meta Quest 3S has better GPU performance than the Quest 2 thanks to its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. But otherwise, Quest 3S games will still <em>look</em> and <em>run</em> like Quest 2 games unless developers patch them to take greater advantage of the new hardware.</p><p>In the Quest 3 graphical showcases above and below, you can see how Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Chapter 2 and Red Matter 2 look dramatically better on the Quest 3 because of Quest 3-specific patches.</p><p>In Walking Dead, Skydance could only add a few zombies on screen at a time with the Quest 2, but can fit entire hordes onto the Quest 3 version, making it more challenging. Walls and buildings have much more detail, outdoor environments lose the obscuring fog and look more vibrant, and NPCs appear more real. This will also apply to the Quest 3S.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/red-matter-2-first-impressions">Red Matter 2</a>, developer Vertical Robot specifically pointed out how the Quest 3 patch added increased rendering resolution and 4K textures with 16X the pixel count in the environment, as well as dynamic shadows and high-quality shadow filtering.</p><p>There&apos;s no universal list of Quest 3S enhancements because developers use the extra power however they choose. But the most common enhancements are higher refresh rates, more detail at further distances, and better textures, shading, and reflections. </p><p>These updates originally targeted the Quest 3 and offered resolution boosts. The Meta Quest 3S can&apos;t take advantage of this because it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">loses to the Quest 3</a> for display resolution, FoV, and clarity. However, all of the other Quest 3 graphical and performance enhancements apply to the Quest 3S by default.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Meta doesn&apos;t have a specific Quest Store category for every Quest 3 game with enhancements that we could find. But it does have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/7552117818138723/">mixed-reality games section</a> that includes over 60 titles as of September 2024; some of these may technically work on Quest 2 with its black-and-white, 4 pixels-per-degree passthrough, but they look significantly better with full-color, 18 PPD passthrough.</p><p>Mixed reality aside, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAOsGIT1pZZssiyt-TjI-pAwCsEWCo3kCmqV7fmnG0s/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">unofficial spreadsheet</a> from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dkxc4c/list_of_quest_3_upgraded_games/?rdt=41740">Redditor FrancoisFromFrance</a> has a list of about 90 Quest 2 games that received Meta Quest 3 patches, and the total number may be higher. It should give you a general idea of which of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> will immediately look next-gen on Meta Quest 3S.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a>, most developers launch with a universal Quest version and then add a Quest 3 patch as a post-launch add-on. That&apos;s why we expect the total number of Quest 3S enhancements to balloon even higher now that Meta has two headsets with next-gen CPUs and no longer sells the Quest 2.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-meta-quest-3s-exclusives-2">What about Meta Quest 3S exclusives?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sVDfKfTJ2pRi4z7uAhfLDa" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-environment-still.jpeg" alt="A still from Batman: Arkham Shadow showing the game's environment, including the Bat Signal in the sky." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sVDfKfTJ2pRi4z7uAhfLDa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we mentioned above, some mixed-reality Quest 3 games technically work on Quest 2, but not especially well. Others are VR games with mixed-reality modes that only work on the Quest 3. And a few MR games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/laser-dance/7209598115800315/">Laser Dance</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hello-dot/25825290007070369/">Hello Dot</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/living-room/7778145568911617/">Living Room</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/starship-home/5959677854068956/">Starship Home</a> will be Meta Quest 3S and 3 exclusives because full-color passthrough is essential to gameplay.</p><p>We expect most mixed-reality games in 2025 and beyond will be Quest 3S exclusives, while VR games with MR modes will still work on both headsets.</p><p>A second, much smaller category is AAA games that only work on the Quest 3 and 3S because the Quest 2 can&apos;t handle the graphics. So far, that only applies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hitman-3-vr-reloaded/8012387035448196/">Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded</a>, which has received middling reviews and still seems to struggle on newer hardware. </p><p>Two future games — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/alien-rogue-incursion/24882487241367228/">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> — are the only other Quest 3S exclusives we know of, though that list will likely grow over time. Of these, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-hands-on">tried out Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> for ourselves and were blown away by its polish and scope. </p><p>If you want more information on the Meta Quest 3S hardware and whether you want to upgrade from the Quest 2, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S hands-on</a> from the Connect event!</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an affordable smartphone with all the hottest AI features, both Samsung and Google have you covered. In this Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a comparison, we look at two of the most prominent “affordable premium” models on the market today.</p><p>You get high-end features typically found in more expensive phones with some concessions to bring the pricing down. What are those concessions, and which of these two phones will better meet your needs? That comes down to your priorities and what you value most in terms of features, design, cameras, and more. Here, we’ll compare and contrast these devices to help you make the right decision.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at how these two phones compare in terms of design. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, the newest addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 line</a>, falls into its “Fan Edition” line. It has a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 3x FHD+ 1,080 x 2,340 display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60 to 120Hz, depending on the application at hand. The display also features Vision Booster, which helps boost the brightness in outdoor environments along with 1,900 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Available in fun colors like Blue, Graphite, Mint, or Yellow, it’s durable with an IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating. With an aluminum frame, the screen is also Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ for added durability. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">his initial Galaxy S24 FE hands-on review</a>, Android Central senior editor Andrew Myrick says the phone looks virtually identical to the previous generation Samsung Galaxy S23 FE and even to the Galaxy S24 Plus. </p><p>It comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage that isn’t expandable beyond cloud services. So, you’ll want to pay extra for the largest option if you tend to snap a lot of photos and videos, keep files, playing games, or download lots of apps. </p><p>Running Android 14 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">Samsung One UI 6.1</a>, you get the latest OS along with seven years of OS and security updates. So, you can be confident that this phone will last and be usable and relevant for many years to come, beyond just its physical durability. </p><p>In terms of battery life, the 4,700mAh battery promises “long-lasting” life of about up to 21 hours of Internet usage. It also includes fast charging that will get you back up to 50 percent after a half-hour charge using a separately purchased 25W adapter and 3A USB-C cable. It also boasts fast wireless charging with WPC chargers and Wireless PowerShare. </p><p>Other basics include Bluetooth 5.3, which includes Bluetooth hearing aid support, Samsung Knox security, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> support, SmartThings support, and, of course, 5G connectivity. The phone will be officially available for purchase at the beginning of October 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb" name="google-pixel-8a-lockscreen-green.jpg" alt="The lockscreen of the Google Pixel 8a with large, chunky clock numbers and a green theme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> compare? Announced in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a is the affordable alternative in the Pixel 8 line, which has since been followed up with by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> line. It surprisingly has many of the same features you’ll find in the Google Pixel 8, but with a smaller 6.1-inch Actua OLED screen with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,400 nits brightness or 2,000 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Its screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which also has a fingerprint-resistant coating. However, it has a lesser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-pixel-8a-waterproof">IP67 water and dust-resistant rating</a>, so it isn’t as durable as the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in that respect. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-8a-should-you-buy">Pixel 8a color options</a> include Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, or a limited-edition Aloe color, and the Google Pixel 8a is made of matte composite with a matte aluminum frame. Nicholas Sutrich said in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">his Pixel 8a review</a> that he likes the rounded corners and finds the phone comfortable to hold.  </p><p>It comes loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and the same seven years of OS and security updates along with Feature Drops that bring new functions to the phone on a consistent basis. So, both devices will hold their value. </p><p>You get only 128GB or 256GB storage options and no expandable memory card slot, so keep this in mind if you think you’ll need more space. There are always cloud services, but Samsung offers a 512GB option for a bit more money, which might be more palatable. However, keep in mind that the Google Pixel 8a comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> trial, though you’ll still need a long-term solution if you’re a digital packrat. </p><p>With a 4,492mAh battery, you get a rated more than a day per charge, though it’s still technically a smaller battery than what’s in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>. You can also extend battery life to up to 72 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode, which limits functions if you just need to make sure it doesn’t die on your before you can get to a power outlet. It also supports both fast and wireless charging. </p><p>There are also stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, and all the other expected inclusions.</p>

<p>Before diving into the operation and cameras, let’s take an at-a-glance look at the specs.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences between these two phones, including in the processor, cameras, and overall size.</p>

<p>If you find the other Samsung Galaxy S24 series phones too rich for your blood, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE was launched at the end of September 2024 to help bring a premium experience to the masses on a budget. </p><p>While the phone, which runs Android 14, includes all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI goodies</a> you would expect in a premium device, it’s also powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400 series chipset</a>, which means it might not run as efficiently as the higher-end models in the line. The processor is Samsung’s own, designed to compete against rivals (like Google’s Tensor G3). It’s used in variants of many Samsung phones in other countries. Samsung claims it offers increased CPU performance and particularly a boost in AI performance.</p><p>In his brief hands-on tests of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, Myrick found the processor fast and snappy. However, he notes that Samsung uses Snapdragon processors in the other Galaxy S24 devices, so the phone has a clear disadvantage with its underclocked Exynos chip.</p><p>Samsung says this processor enables a favorable gaming experience thanks to features like Ray Tracing and a larger vapor chamber to improve cooling. Features like the bigger battery and screen, refresh rate, and Vision Booster also presumably contribute to the mobile gaming experience. The phone has 8GB RAM, which is sufficient for multitasking, gaming, and more. </p><p>In terms of AI, you can access all the same AI features you can on other Galaxy S24 devices. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for searching or scribbling over an item on a web page or in a video, for example, to learn more about it. There’s also Interpreter Mode for translating in-person conversations, lectures, presentations, and more. It’s even usable when offline. With Live Translate, you can translate phone calls in real time, including using popular third-party apps. </p><p>For productivity, there’s also Composer that generates suggested text based on keywords in e-mails and supported social media apps. Note Assist, meanwhile, helps you while taking notes by automating formatting and translation, even transcribing and summarizing voice recordings. </p><p>One thing Myrick wonders, however, is if the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE will be left behind when new, more powerful AI tools are launched that it can’t support. That’s something to think about if the AI experience is at the top of your mind. </p><p>With Samsung Knox, you get multiple layers of security to protect your sensitive data and web surfing. This includes real-time threat detection.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a is powered by the same Google Tensor G3 chip you’ll find in other Google Pixel phones launched in 2023, so there’s no step down in that respect. It also has 8GB RAM and the same AI features you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE and its Pixel siblings, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.  </p><p>Google adds some additional flavor through the built-in Gemini AI assistant, including Pixel Call Assist, Call Screen, Direct My Call, Hold for Me, Clear Calling, and more. With Audio Emoji, you can create your own soundtrack audio effects during a call, like applause or laughing. </p><p>Sufficient for gaming, too, the Google Pixel 8a’s thermal management is one area that Sutrich highlights as being especially impressive. In his tests, it performed even better than the Pixel 8 Pro. So, if you’re a gamer, this phone will work for you, too. </p><p>Protected by security features as well, the Google Pixel 8a comes with VPN by Google One, the Tensor security core, a Titan M2 security chip, and anti-malware and phishing protection. Use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Family Link</a> to manage privacy settings for kids, set screen time limits, and share location.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-selfie-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Selfie Camera viewfinder on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s look at the camera experience. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has a 50MP wide lens along with an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. Both are supported by optical image stabilization (OIS). There’s also a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP selfie camera. These are decent specs but nothing to write home about. </p><p>What does stand out is Samsung’s ProVisual Engine, an AI-driven camera engine that the company says helps improve your photos and videos. AI image signal processing (ISP), for example, helps improve low light photography when in Nightography mode. AI zoom helps enhance image quality at distances between digital zoom lengths. </p><p>There’s also an Object-Aware Engine that recognizes scenes and optimizes colors in Super High Dynamic Range (HDR) so you get more lifelike photos and videos, according to Samsung. </p><p>There are neat photo editing tools as well through Photo Assist once you have captured images and want to make them better. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a> can be used to move or remove objects in the background. Portrait Studio allows you to apply styles to photos, like cartoon, comics, watercolor painting, or sketch. With Edit Suggestion, remove flaws in photos like reflections. Instant Slow-mo, meanwhile, helps create more compelling videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-04.jpg" alt="Taking a picture with the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Naturally, the Google Pixel 8a also has some compelling photo-taking and editing features that leverage AI. It has a larger 64MP quad PD wide camera with Super Res Zoom up to 8x. The ultra-wide camera is 13MP combined with a 13MP front camera. You don’t get a telephoto camera with this phone, though. </p><p>Enjoy Google features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for moving or resizing objects and using preset backgrounds, and Best Take for taking the best elements of several photos of the same thing (think group photo) to create the best one. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for removing distracting elements from a photo, Photo Unblur for adding clarity to otherwise blurry photos, Real Tone for more accurate skin tones, Face Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and more. For videos, there’s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature that you can use to remove distracting background noise. </p><p>After trying the Pixel 8a cameras, Sutrich says the results are fabulous, with good contrast, color accuracy, and capturing of subjects in motion. For now, we have not been able to extensively test the Galaxy S24 FE, but we plan to fully evaluate the camera in a full review.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the big decision between the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a. While the Google Pixel 8a is slightly older, it’s still a relatively new phone that offers seven years of OS and security updates. And it hasn’t even been a year since it came to market. Considering it&apos;s cheaper, has a more powerful processor, tons of AI features, and isn’t that big a step down from the Google Pixel 8, that phone offers tremendous value for money and is the better option of the two. It remains the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> you can buy. </p><p>With the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, you’re dealing with a (potentially) pared-down processor, and while we haven’t tested it fully yet, it may not run as efficiently as you hope in the long run nor be able to support AI features coming down the pipe years from now. If you’re a casual user, you might not mind. However, considering that it’s still more expensive than the Google Pixel 8a, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE might not make sense to many. Myrick agrees, noting the Galaxy S24 FE would be a much more compelling option if the pricing dropped by a hundred or more bucks. </p><p>What are the reasons to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE instead? If you want to stick within the Galaxy smartphone universe, it’s the most affordable model in the new line. It is more durable than the Google Pixel 8a with a higher water- and dust-resistance rating. It also has a much larger screen, so if you prefer bigger over compact and would make use of the extra screen real estate, it might suit your needs better. </p><p>There’s also the bigger battery and the option for a 512GB variant that could sway your decision. Though considering the approximately $200 delta in price, when you look at the 512GB version, you could sign up for years of cloud storage with the savings. </p><p>If you aren’t interested in getting all the AI goodies and just want a solid yet affordable Samsung Galaxy phone, another option to consider is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Samsung Galaxy A series phone</a>. This mid-range line includes several popular models, including newly introduced ones, some of which sell for even under $200. If you go up the line, you can find a phone that’s comparable in price to the Google Pixel 8a that gets you into the Galaxy space without breaking the bank. Just note that many of these phones sport an Exynos processor as well and aren’t as feature-rich as the Galaxy S24 FE. </p><p>The only real reason to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is if you are adamant about sticking with Samsung and don’t want to fork over $1000+ for a flagship. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers the opportunity to get into the Samsung space for a mid-range price. We just wish it had kept the same Snapdragon processor and found another way to justify the price drop beyond swapping the processor.</p>

<p>If you really want to get a Samsung Galaxy device, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is a premium, new phone at a mid-range price. With seven years of updates, you can be assured it will last for some time. Plus, AI goodies mean it rivals its bigger sisters in that respect. The processor might not support future AI needs, however, so you’ll need to consider that in your decision. But it has a bigger screen and gets you into the S24 family for less.</p></p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Bluetooth has been around for over 25 years and it&apos;s still unreliable compared to Wi-Fi or even cellular. Unless I use matching equipment from Apple or Samsung I have nothing but problems with buffering and connection issues. Why is this still happening in 2024?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance</strong></em></p>
<p>Hiya! I understand your frustration and agree that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-headsets">Bluetooth</a> seems to have more issues than Wi-Fi and cellular (provided you have a good connection) <em>sometimes</em>. That&apos;s the key word here, sometimes. And for some people, in some places.</p><p>The short answer for people who aren&apos;t interested in going deeper: Bluetooth uses a heavily congested slice of frequency, depends on several different proprietary technologies, and different devices have different additions on top of it all.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the right (wrong) place at the right (wrong) time using the right (wrong) equipment, you&apos;re going to have a bad time. Otherwise, Bluetooth can be reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">and even great</a> — it is for millions of people.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is a bit like a layer cake. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-excited-about-android-15-audio-sharing-feature">base, bare-bones implementation</a> can be open-source and openly available using mostly open hardware, and that&apos;s great. But almost nobody uses it that way because it will be exactly what&apos;s described above — unreliable — most of the time.</p>

<p>Companies like Intel, Apple, Qualcomm, and other tech conglomerates have built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">useful additions</a> that make Bluetooth better, more reliable, and even faster on the same frequency because of improved compression. </p><p>If you buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone</a> and a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-airpods-good-earbud-choice-android-users">AirPods</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds</a>, you&apos;re probably going to have a great experience because both sides on the hardware front use the same software and have been built to work especially well with each other. </p>
<p>That doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t work well with other equipment. It just means that they have been designed to work best with each other. Other, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-true-wireless-earbuds">often inexpensive accessories and equipment</a>, may not have the same additions to Bluetooth and can&apos;t take advantage of higher output strength or better compression, and the experience isn&apos;t going to be the same.</p><p>Chances are it&apos;s still going to be good though, because the biggest issues with Bluetooth depend on the other equipment around you.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-getting-crowded-in-here-2">It&apos;s getting crowded in here</h2>
<p>Without getting into the numbers and buffers, or the intricacies of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance">CSMA/CA</a>, Bluetooth operates in the same "airspace" as 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and plenty of unregulated equipment. The channels in these frequencies are often crowded and when some of the devices make no effort to intelligently work with other equipment, it can be a mess.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm" name="amazonbasics-microwave-review-7.jpg" alt="AmazonBasics Microwave" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest offenders when it comes to Bluetooth network interference are (believe it or not) microwave ovens and old cordless landline telephones. Both emit signals (in the case of a microwave, it&apos;s a byproduct) in the 2.4GHz range and will interfere with both 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Microwaves are especially problematic because they do not know they are causing interference and simply do not care; hit the button to start them up, and they leak radio waves through old inefficient seals everywhere.</p><p>Bluetooth and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi also can interfere with each other, but that&apos;s where CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) comes into play. It&apos;s a network protocol that devices use to actively avoid interference and most of the time it does a good job.</p><p>When Bluetooth signals are faced with interference there can be audio buffering, connection issues, and connections dropping intermittently. There may not be anything you can do about it other than move somewhere else.</p>
<p>As older devices are phased out and old equipment is replaced with newer and more efficient equipment, the problem will "fix" itself.</p><p>These seemingly small problems can all add up to be the reason why Bluetooth is bad for one person while it&apos;s great for another. The equipment and your location are important pieces of the puzzle. Don&apos;t write off the technology because it obviously works well for millions of people, even if it works poorly for you.</p>
