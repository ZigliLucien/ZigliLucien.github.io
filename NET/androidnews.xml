                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Elysian Acoustic Labs has a halo status in the enthusiast audio segment, and for good reason; the brand consistently delivers standout designs with exquisite sound quality. So when Elysian Acoustic Labs announced it was making IEMs that will retail for under $500, there was considerable interest. The brand&apos;s products cost five times as much, and its most affordable IEMs until now was the $1,699 Diva.</p><p>That&apos;s changing with the introduction of the Pilgrim. The IEMs retain Elysian Labs&apos; fanatical attention to detail and build quality, and they&apos;re easily one of the more distinctive IEMs you&apos;ll see in this segment. But what you&apos;ll like the most is the pricing; the Pilgrim is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim">for $399 at audio retailers like HiFiGo</a>, and that is a terrific value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="78JexVhFAYrYP5j9ZRcD8a" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-4.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78JexVhFAYrYP5j9ZRcD8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design in particular is where the Pilgrim stands out considerably from the rest of the pack, so that&apos;s a good starting point. Most IEMs in this segment use resin-based shells, but the Pilgrim is made out of machined aluminum, and the sound nozzle is constructed out of stainless steel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CAKBMbGE9J3eLzhwE2nxoZ" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-3.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAKBMbGE9J3eLzhwE2nxoZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the choice of materials means the Pilgrim is built to last, and to the brand&apos;s credit, the IEMs look and feel like they should cost a lot more. A lot of that is down to the design of the faceplate; the reflective rings with the Elysian Labs logo nestled in the middle gives the IEMs plenty of design flair, and it definitely grabs attention. I didn&apos;t notice this in daily use, but the grooves in between the rings pick up a lot of dust — that was evident when taking photos of the product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4PNxRRUgjV4onGnS7Pstyb" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-10.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4PNxRRUgjV4onGnS7Pstyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wasn&apos;t sure about the comfort of the IEMs given the metal chassis, but that isn&apos;t an issue in daily use. The sizing leans towards the larger side, but I didn&apos;t see any problems getting a snug fit, and the IEMs didn&apos;t cause any fatigue even with extended use. The rounded corners make a difference in this regard, and because of the way the sound nozzle is designed, you get really good isolation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RQfAi2xkBPF57iBwMZWbua" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-7.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQfAi2xkBPF57iBwMZWbua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the bundled cable. Elysian Labs includes a silver-plated copper cable with the Pilgrim, and it is excellent. It has a clear sheath covering the entire length of the cable — giving it better durability — and the only qualm I have with the cable is that it doesn&apos;t have a modular plug. You can choose a 3.5mm or 4.4mm connector when ordering the Pilgrim, but there&apos;s no way to change between the two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RZ4EmJSynSxDSJeMPktKvc" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-13.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RZ4EmJSynSxDSJeMPktKvc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the cable connects to the IEMs via Pentaconn plugs, and they jut out a bit. It would have been better to see a standard 2-pin system as that would have allowed the Pilgrim to be used with a wider selection of aftermarket cables, and the connector itself is fragile, so you&apos;ll need to be vigilant while plugging in the cable.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 1</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X73kAe3vvnhSb27YJnxSCZ" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-1.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X73kAe3vvnhSb27YJnxSCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Elysian Labs did a great job with the packaging as well, and you get a hard shell case to hold the Pilgrim when not in use. However, you just get three SpinFit silicone tips with the package, and that&apos;s not nearly adequate; I would have liked to see a greater selection of options given the asking price. That said, the bundled tips should provide a good fit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oMdywugYSgHcBkVgsS44La" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-5.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMdywugYSgHcBkVgsS44La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pilgrim uses a hybrid driver configuration that features a 9.2mm dynamic driver encased in a liquid silicone rubber shell that&apos;s designed to deliver better sub-bass, and it&apos;s joined by two sets of Sonion balanced armature drivers: the Sonion 2300 for the mids, and a pair of the brand&apos;s E50 drivers that handle the treble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GmRP4egRXHKHGbP2hi2NNb" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-8.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmRP4egRXHKHGbP2hi2NNb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sound tubes and acoustic chamber of the Pilgrim are crafted via 3D printing, and this allows the brand to deliver better consistency while manufacturing. With an impedance of just 9Ω and sensitivity of 101dB, the Pilgrim is incredibly easy to drive, and you don&apos;t need a powerful source to make the most out of the sound. I used it predominantly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">Fiio M23</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">M15S</a>, and you can use any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">dongle DAC</a> instead to drive the Pilgrim with your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PreXsoGmqxi6e6g9udgNdc" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-12.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PreXsoGmqxi6e6g9udgNdc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, what&apos;s immediately evident is the bass shelf; the Pilgrim has a distinct sub-bass boost, and you get a very noticeable rumble that&apos;s delightful. The IEMs pair very well with mainstream music, and if you&apos;re looking for a bass-heavy sound signature, it is one of the best in this segment. The exuberance doesn&apos;t extend as much to the mid-bass, but you still get excellent definition and clarity.</p><p>Thankfully, the bass extension doesn&apos;t influence the mids, and you get excellent clarity and detail retrieval. Vocals are clear and natural, but what&apos;s particularly great is just how good instruments sound — you can hear every nuance even in an ensemble setting.</p><p>The treble has good definition, and while it is a bit bright, there isn&apos;t noticeable sibilance. The soundstage is wide and inviting, and the Pilgrim nails the technical details; the tuning lends itself well to a lot of modern genres.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ExayjeYxNoQCecgGYvEZLd" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-14.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExayjeYxNoQCecgGYvEZLd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the Pilgrim looks and sounds like it should cost at least twice as much as its $399 retail price, and if you want high-quality IEMs with a distinctive bass-focused sound, it is a no-brainer. The minor quibbles — lack of a modular cable and limited accessories — ultimately don&apos;t make a difference, and the Pilgrim is now my go-to choice in the sub-$500 segment.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Digital audio players are a good choice if you want the versatility of Android and need something with easy portability. Obviously, a phone with a high-quality DAC and an audio jack — maybe even a 4.4mm port — would be ideal, and although Moondrop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moondrop-miad01-review">had the right idea with the MIAD01</a>, the software wasn&apos;t ideal, and as much as I enjoyed using that device, it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to a dedicated player.</p><p>So when Fiio said it was launching the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a>, I was interested. I have a lot of audio gear in the house, so I get the freedom to rotate between IEMs, headsets, and players pretty regularly. The M11S has been in constant use for the better part of a year, and the portability and sound quality made it the ideal device to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">stream Roon</a> when I&apos;m not at my desk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6vRVNJhPCiSbH4kyW7MXEb" name="fiio-m23-5.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 runs vanilla Android 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vRVNJhPCiSbH4kyW7MXEb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">K9 Pro</a> (and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>), the M11S was the Fiio product that got the most amount of use, and that mantle has now been taken over by the M23. At the outset, there isn&apos;t too much that&apos;s different; the M23 has the same glass-and-metal design as the M11S, and the controls are in the same location.</p><p>The key difference is the switch to AKM&apos;s AK4191EQ and AK4499EX DACs, and this allows the M23 to stand out a little. If that combination sounds familiar, it&apos;s because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q15-review">Q15 Bluetooth DAC</a> also uses the same AKM parts, along with a lot of the other audio hardware. Because of the upgrades, the M23 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-M23-Snapdragon-AK4191EQ-AK4499EX/dp/B0D14PGZV1">available for $699 on Amazon</a>, a $200 increase over the M11S.</p>

<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. Fiio didn&apos;t make too many changes in this area, and as such the M23 still has the same faceted edges and glass back. That said, the unit is noticeably larger thanks to a 5.5-inch panel and 5500mAh battery, and at 299g, it is 28g heavier than the M11S.</p>

<p>That said, there are several quality-of-life improvements. Fiio positioned the audio ports at the top, and it makes plugging in IEMs and headsets that much more convenient. There&apos;s no 2.5mm jack this time, with the M23 instead providing just the 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports, with each encircled by a ring, just like on the Q15.</p>

<p>The back is made out of glass, and it has a navy hue that looks rather nice and makes the M23 look very elegant. The unit is still a smudge magnet, and you will ideally need to use the bundled clear case to make the most of it. The playback controls are on the right, and they&apos;re joined by a Desktop Mode and Hold toggles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fUA3PgQd6qYeV2DMFxJMAa" name="fiio-m23-12.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has dual USB-C connectivity and a MicroSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fUA3PgQd6qYeV2DMFxJMAa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the bottom, you get the MicroSD slot, a USB-C port that allows you to connect the M23 to other sources, and a dedicated USB-C port for charging the device. This is nifty, as it allows you to use the standalone USB-C connection when charging the player.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cq7TwoDtzvmZHxXpFQDZwX" name="fiio-m23-11.jpg" alt="Side view of Fiio M23 showing the volume slider and power button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cq7TwoDtzvmZHxXpFQDZwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power button, volume slider, and multifunction button sit to the left, and Fiio switched out the usual volume buttons to a haptic option that&apos;s just not as good to use. It is very sensitive to minute changes, and inevitably triggers whenever I pick up the unit. Clearly, the brand knew about this issue, so it included the Hold toggle — which disables the volume slider. I don&apos;t see what was wrong with traditional volume buttons, and Fiio missed the brief in this regard.</p><p>Outside of that, the build quality is fantastic; the M23 is made out of aluminum — or steel, if you pick up that variant — and it is built to last. The M11S is still in pristine condition after a year of regular use, and the M23 has the same robust chassis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QvTekth8Exeunah2tuGrzc" name="fiio-m23-18.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 next to Fiio FA19" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QvTekth8Exeunah2tuGrzc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the panel, the M23 has a 5.5-inch 720p LCD screen with 60Hz refresh. It isn&apos;t anywhere close to the caliber of displays that you get on mid-range phones these days, but it is more than adequate in the context of a digital audio player. It has thin bezels, good colors, and I didn&apos;t have any issues in outdoor use, so it gets bright enough in auto mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z2J8onoUGw3zzuYFEDC8qY" name="fiio-m23-7.jpg" alt="All the usage modes available with the Fiio M23" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2J8onoUGw3zzuYFEDC8qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, the interface doesn&apos;t have any customization and is fluid; Fiio took a vanilla Android build and added a lot of audio-focused features to it, while leaving the UI intact. You can choose between several modes — Android interface, a music mode that only enables Fiio Music, DAC mode, Bluetooth receiver, and so on. There&apos;s also the ability to adjust the gain between low, medium, and high, and you get Roon integration, another notable inclusion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YjFiJ74oZDDLYEaJCM5yUa" name="fiio-m23-15.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has controls on the right" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YjFiJ74oZDDLYEaJCM5yUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest addition this time is Desktop Mode; when enabled, the M23 relies solely on external power, so you can plug it into a desktop source and know that the built-in battery isn&apos;t going through the usual charge/discharge cycle. On that note, the 5500mAh battery lasts up to nine hours over the balanced port, and nearly 11 hours over the single-ended 3.5mm jack.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gz9ccyk5NiC5dKgbqcGDab" name="fiio-m23-9.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has a volume slider that's too sensitive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gz9ccyk5NiC5dKgbqcGDab.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charging the unit is easier as well, as it now uses the USB PD 30W standard. It takes just over an hour to get the battery up to 80%, but it takes another hour to hit the remaining 20%. That said, fast charging is a great addition, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with battery longevity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GbH8uwbuKqoGrNGJ2LriqZ" name="fiio-m23-6.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbH8uwbuKqoGrNGJ2LriqZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My biggest quibble with the M23 is that it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-10">Android 10</a> out of the box — that&apos;s just not good enough in 2024. I get that the unit doesn&apos;t have all the relevant phone bits, but it still comes with a full-fledged Android build and the Play Store, and it needs to be at least on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, if not switching to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> outright.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nZbADnvJr2Tyt3B7HgRbbc" name="fiio-m23-17.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 about page showing device info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZbADnvJr2Tyt3B7HgRbbc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the hardware, the M23 uses the Snapdragon 660 and has 4GB of RAM along with 64GB of internal storage. You won&apos;t see anything as old as the Snapdragon 660 on a phone, but it works well enough on a digital audio player, and considering the effort Fiio put into optimizing the chipset, it&apos;s understandable that the manufacturer isn&apos;t willing to use Qualcomm&apos;s recent offerings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VAkPmoTEPqwWqTkXJ4qrdX" name="fiio-m23-3.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 next to Fiio FA19 and with music running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VAkPmoTEPqwWqTkXJ4qrdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Fiio retained most of the same hardware, the sound characteristic of the M23 is noticeably different thanks to AKG&apos;s DACs and the use of THX AAA-78+ amps with a higher power output. The M23 hits 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and has DSD512 decoding, MQA, and a slate of audio codecs: SBC, AAC, AptX, AptX HD, LDAC, and LHDC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dPpiNCBT7eejf6SEbmQ2YY" name="fiio-m23-8.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has adjustable gain" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPpiNCBT7eejf6SEbmQ2YY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It can deliver up to 1000mW of power over the balanced port at 32Ω, and that makes it a great choice to use with demanding planar headsets. I tested the M23 with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Moondrop Venus</a>, and over a dozen of the best IEMs, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie200-review">Sennheiser IE200</a>, and FH15, and the audio player did a brilliant job with all connected devices.</p>
<p>The M23 retains Fiio&apos;s custom sound tuning, and you get a neutral soundstage with a little vibrancy in the mids. The bass has good definition and detail on the FT5, and it allows the fast transients of the planar headset to be that much more vibrant. The mids have a lot of character and dynamism, and ensemble instruments sound incredible. There&apos;s good treble extension, but you don&apos;t get any sibilance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pEVY5tGFhXxpnUSkQsi7pd" name="fiio-m23-19.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 volume slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEVY5tGFhXxpnUSkQsi7pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At a technical level, the M23 hits all the right notes. The imaging and dynamics are spot-on — as is the case with most of Fiio&apos;s 2024 offerings — and if you want a neutral sound that lets you take full advantage of connected audio gear, the M23 is a standout choice in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nwe8YuYcSLfDNjPe4EgfWZ" name="fiio-m23-2.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 connected to Fiio FA19" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwe8YuYcSLfDNjPe4EgfWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, it costs an additional $200 over the similarly-excellent M11S, and I really think Fiio should have updated the software. On the plus side, you get AKM&apos;s latest DAC, and the M23 is able to deliver higher power, so if you plan on using it with planar headsets, it is a better choice. But if you want to maximize value, the M11S is still a great value in 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps Timeline is moving away from the web to the mobile app. Users will need to switch to the app to access their location history.</li><li>Google is giving its users time until 1 December to make the switch, after which most of their routes and visits will be auto deleted. </li><li>The company says that this switch will help users have more control over their data that will be stored on their device, rather than Google's servers.</li></ul>

<p>In its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">update</a>, Google stated that it will remove the Timeline feature on the web version of Google Maps. The timeline, originally named "location history," is a feature that lets you keep track of the places you&apos;ve visited and the routes traveled. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-view-your-location-history-google-maps">Timeline</a>, since 2015, has added the ability to collate images you&apos;ve taken at particular locations, giving you a better overview of all your travels.</p><p>In December 2023, Google changed where the location history was being stored. Users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default) will see Google Maps&apos; Timeline saved directly on their device rather than the web, giving them even more control over their data. </p><p>This means that if you access Google Maps on the web, the Timeline will not show any history about the places you&apos;ve visited. Instead, the company is pushing users to download the app and continue accessing the feature. </p><p>The tech giant states that to keep their old Timeline data and continue storing new information, users need to update to the most recent version of Maps, follow the instructions, which they will receive as a push notification, in-app alert, on-screen instructions, or email, and Tap on <strong>done</strong>.</p>

<p>According to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-timeline-location-data-on-device-migration/">email</a> sent to Android Police, users have until December 1, 2024, to be able to make the shift from the web version to the app. Otherwise, all the saved data will be lost. However, the company says that it will try moving up to 90 days of Timeline data to the "first-signed- in device" after the deadline. Any routes or visits made before that period will be auto-deleted.</p><p>Several users took to Reddit to express their dismay about this transition, while some felt that Google will now take the time to perfect the Timeline feature on the app. </p><p>One user stated that they use Google Timeline on the web daily and "this is very very bad news for me. They keep the option to upload to cloud, however that will be encrypted thus web viewing is gone. They don&apos;t care about current web users at all."</p><p>Another user feels that this would be a great move in terms of the overall experience using the Timeline feature on mobile,"it&apos;s not easy to navigate right now which is why I sometimes turn to the web, simple because it&apos;s faster and has more filtering options."</p><p>Transitioning from the Web to the App will give users autonomy over their personal data without the stress of having Google handle it. However, it could cause inconvenience to those who prefer using the web version to keep track of their whereabouts. The company says it is rolling this out gradually, and users will get a notification when an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1#:~:text=Timeline%20for%20Web%20Maps%20will%20be%20going%20away">update</a> is available for their account.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has a July Unpacked event to launch its highly anticipated foldable phones. Ahead of the launch, the first official marketing images appeared on the web, showcasing the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Z Flip 6.</p><p>The marketing image, looking like an advertisement for the upcoming Galaxy foldables was spotted by a Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-design-accidentally-leaked-samsung/">SamMobile</a>) on Samsung’s Kazakhstan website. According to the Reddit post, Samsung accidentally leaked the advertisement on the site before the launch.</p>

<p>The ad showcases the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a> alongside the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, which will likely debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable phones</a> next month. The shared image showcases the new design of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which will now have sharp edges and flat sides similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. </p><p>It will also have a triple camera system at the rear where all the cameras are stacked vertically in a single camera visor. The design looks similar to what we saw in the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-z-fold-6-leak-reveals-the-foldable-from-the-front">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn’t see radical changes in terms of design when compared to the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The latter’s design was afresh, and it will likely continue this year, too, which is encouraging to see. It will have a more prominent cover display (folder-shaped) accompanied by dual primary cameras. </p>

<p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">previous rumors</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is expected to have a wider cover screen than the predecessor model and potentially feature wider overall dimensions when unfolded. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/forget-rumors-this-is-our-closest-look-at-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-in-real-world">leaked real-life image</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 dummy unit earlier this month also suggested the same.</p><p>The foldables launching next month will be powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and the foldable screens are rumored to have less crease than previous iterations. Ahead of the anticipated July 10 launch date, having an early glimpse of these foldables is an encouraging aspect to look forward to.</p>

<p>In a curious move, Google Messages is no longer displaying a user&apos;s draft in its main view.</p><p>The issue was reported in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1d81tf9/google_messages_is_no_longer_showing_previews_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Pixel subreddit</a> with users highlighting how Messages no longer display "Draft" in the conversation list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/04/google-messages-drafts/">9to5Google</a>).

Instead of displaying the drafted message in italics, the thread will move to the top of the list.

<p>If this <em>isn&apos;t </em>a bug, drafts disappearing from the main view wouldn&apos;t be too surprising as Google has removed other features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-auto-group-sms-texts-disappeared">like organization</a> for personal and business. The Messages app used to display chips for "All," "Personal," and "Business" texts but the choice to organize messages into those categories was removed.</p><p>The feature succeeded in helping users declutter their Messages app as they didn&apos;t have to see "Business" texts if they didn&apos;t want to. Last year, it was assumed that it was a bug (similar to today), but it quickly became a feature that was no more.</p><p>In other news, users are set to gain a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-cleaner-text-field-redesign">new, cleaner writing field</a> in Messages. The field will offer an emoji icon and a plus icon for adding images and other media instead of being filled with other Messages options.

<ul><li>Quickly following a rash of user reports, Google is rolling out an update for Android Auto's Maps beta to solve its problems.</li><li>Users on Reddit have reported severe crashing with Android Auto when attempting to open Google Maps or use voice commands.</li><li>In the meantime, users may have to use Maps on their phones instead of Android Auto as the patch takes time to reach devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is quickly rushing out a patch for affected Android Auto devices that have encountered problems with its Maps beta.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-beta-crashing-android-auto/">Android Police</a> spotted the company rolling out a patch for the Maps beta marked as version <strong>11.132.01.01</strong> to Android Auto devices for the crashes. It might take a while before your device picks it up, so it could be best to avoid the Google Maps beta altogether.</p><p>For context, the company rolled out its latest Maps beta earlier this week, marked as version 11.132.0100. After installing, users quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/google_maps_beta_version_111320100_breaks_android/">took to Reddit</a> to report that the software broke their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> consoles. One user report highlighted that initiating Android Auto would crash Google Maps, leaving users in an endless cycle of crashing and returning to their app list.</p><p>Opening the app on an Android phone works fine, but throwing its contents over to your car is where things fall apart. Voice commands were also reportedly breaking the app and Android Auto&apos;s software.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l752i3l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user stated</a> they left the Maps beta and uninstalled all updates, reverting to the stable build, and still encountered problems. Hopefully, Google&apos;s latest attempt at a patch rectifies the problem.</p><p>There appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l75d66c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">an issue with charging</a>, as well, as one user reported that their phone is no longer charging when plugged into their console. Another user confirmed the problem, but it&apos;s unclear if this problem is related to the Maps beta issues.</p>

<p>As previously stated, Google has started rolling out a new patch today (June 6) to try and correct the Maps beta&apos;s effects on Android Auto. If you&apos;re involved and are uninterested in waiting, you can grab the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/maps/maps-11-132-0101-release/">APK Mirror file</a>.</p><p>Shortly after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">I/O 2024</a>, the company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-make-car-rides-more-fun-with-new-entertainment-and-navigation-apps">a few features</a> for Android Auto to help bring some life to long car rides. Among the additions, drivers gained apps like Max, Peacock, and even Angry Birds. The update included the debut of Google Cast on the Android Automotive OS, which lets users throw content like videos from their phones to their vehicle&apos;s console.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into the Google Drive app highlighted the company's work at bringing a new document-scanning feature to users.</li><li>It was spotted that Google could let users save their scanned documents as JPG files, creating a high-quality save of every scanned page.</li><li>Google Drive was recently spotted working on a new category system for users that would help them re-discover the most important files.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users working with documents and PDFs might gain a useful upgrade in quality for what they upload to Google Drive.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-drive-save-scanned-document-as-jpeg-apk-teardown-3449048/">Android Authority</a> in an APK search, Google is working on a way to save scanned documents as .jpeg files alongside the usual PDF option. A few strings point toward this coming functionality in the latest version of Drive, v2.24.2. Strings like "jpeg_format_label" refer to the .jpeg save option while the "ds_jpeg_quality_summary" tag is for the quality of saved pages.</p><p>It looks like Google will let users personally set the level of quality for scanned documents, according to its code. One string refers to the JPEG default quality, which is seemingly set at 80. This will likely be shown beneath the "quality_title" highlighted in the code.</p><p>Additionally, Drive&apos;s JPEG option for scanned documents will create multiple files if the JPEG option is desired. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-drive-tips-and-tricks">Google Drive</a> app shows a string that reads "jpeg_multipage_explanation." Its description details that "saving as JPG will create multiple files."</p><p>The publication speculates that Drive will create a high-quality image of every page within that uploaded document for user convenience.</p><p>JPEG files will likely be a boon to users trying to send pages of important information, especially if a PDF file isn&apos;t accepted. For now, this is just a discovery, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see when/if Google rolls it out to users.</p>

<p>With better document scanning (hopefully) on the way, Google was spotted working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-category-system-spotted">better category system</a> for Drive. The discovery in its Android app showed that users could soon gain a customizable category filter on the "Home" tab. Categories like auto, banking, expenses, home, IDS, insurance, and more were found.</p><p>Google intends to let users choose which categories mean the most and display them in a row at the top of the Home tab. A new "Manage categories" option will join this update, available in the three-dot menu of a document. Tapping it will let users assign certain tags (categories) to a document for easy discovery.</p><p>Also, in April, Google brought Drive&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-search-filters-android">useful search upgrade</a>, which launched first on iOS, to Android users. Folks can quickly search for files they&apos;ve modified recently and other modifiers like "File Type" and "Owner."</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s advanced AI assistant app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, appears to have overcome initial regulatory hurdles and is now available for download in the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p><p>Despite initial announcements of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">global launch in early May</a>, Google&apos;s rollout of its Gemini app bypassed the European region unless you turned to third-party app stores. This delay, likely due to regulatory considerations, has now been addressed.</p><p>Now, the Gemini app has begun a phased rollout across the European continent, following its February debut in the United States, broadening its user base beyond its initial domestic launch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/gemini-mobile-app-finally-comes-eu-uk/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>This means millions more users can now use Gemini on the fly. Additionally, Google Pixel users are able to seamlessly switch from the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to Gemini, enabling voice activation through the familiar "Hey Google" prompt.</p><p>While Gemini offers a compelling alternative to Assistant, it&apos;s important to note that currently, only one assistant can be your primary choice. Switching to Gemini will disable some functionalities previously handled by Assistant.</p><p>While Gemini excels at handling mobile tasks with improved context-awareness, it currently doesn&apos;t support smart home integration. Users who rely on Assistant for this should proceed cautiously and stick to using Gemini for web-based tasks for the time being. A future update may hopefully bring smart home compatibility.</p><p>The delayed European launch of Gemini mirrors the rollout strategy of its predecessor, Bard. Similar regulatory concerns about user privacy likely required a staggered release schedule for Bard in the EU.</p><p>Google plans to enhance accessibility by integrating Gemini directly into the official Google app for iOS in the coming weeks. This means iPhone users won&apos;t need to download a separate app, making it easier to access Gemini on a platform familiar to many mobile users.</p><p>The broader availability of the app signifies Google&apos;s embrace of the generative AI era, marking a strategic shift towards integrating AI functionalities across various product lines. This includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">launch of Gemini-powered Chromebook laptops</a>, highlighting Google&apos;s dedication to a future where AI is central to user experiences.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is gearing up for multiple product launches in July, including the launch of foldables alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. On the other hand, there have been rumblings of a fan edition Galaxy Watch that could drop. A new leak reveals what the budget-friendly Galaxy Watch FE looks like.</p><p>The leak comes from tipster Sudhanshu Ambhore on X, who shared three interesting renders of the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-likely-to-bring-galaxy-watch-fe-soon">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, the company’s first Fan Edition smartwatch. The renders are in three conventional Black, Blue, and Rose/Pink variants.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: Samsung Galaxy Watch FE renders! pic.twitter.com/Jtzp9eUIaC<a href="https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1797874557132619872">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster also shared additional details of the next budget smartwatch from Samsung, which will sport a 1.2-inch AMOLED display accompanied by an Exynos W920 dual-core CPU with 1.18GHz clock speeds.</p><p>It will further feature 1.5GB of RAM paired with 16GB of onboard storage, and it will ship with Wear OS with Samsung’s One UI 5.0 running on top of it. Keeping the lights on is a 247mAh battery capacity with a 30-hour battery life promise, and it also supports wireless charging. </p><p>The other additional details provided by the tipster indicate that the Galaxy Watch FE would feature an aluminum body with water resistance up to 50 meters — thanks to its 5ATM and IP68 rating. </p><p>The smartwatch is said to be compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> running Android 11 and above and featuring at least 1.5GB of RAM. It will also support dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, NFS, and GPS. Since it also acts as a fitness tracker, we can expect sensors like electric cardiac and heart rate sensors, for example. </p>
<p>Per the details shared by the tipster, the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE looks promising on paper and in terms of design, which sounds reasonable for a first-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">budget smartwatch</a> from Samsung. </p><p>The latest leak is also one of the major ones, as it showcases the device and its specs. So far, we have only seen the device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fcc-listings-foreshadow-galaxy-watch-7-series-and-budget-galaxy-watch-fe">being spotted</a> in FCC listings last month. The smartwatch, as mentioned, is anticipated to launch next to foldables on July 10 alongside Galaxy Watch 7 and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">Ultra model</a> of the flagship series. </p>
