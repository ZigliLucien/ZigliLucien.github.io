<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> QPR2 Beta 2 update is rolling out to testers on eligible Pixel devices starting today, Dec. 16, Google announced in a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hftm6b/android_15_qpr2_beta_2_now_available/" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Android Beta Program subreddit. The update includes a variety of bug fixes and other improvements; however, the exciting part of Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 is what wasn't officially announced.</p><p>A few work-in-progress features spotted in earlier versions of Android 15 beta releases now appear to be functional. For starters, the Linux Terminal app for Android is now working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2. The new app was first spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, but didn't work — it would crash after trying to load a new virtual machine. Now, in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2, the app can download, configure, and run instances of Linux using the Android Virtualization Framework.</p><p>Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 testers confirmed the Linux Terminal app worked after upgrading, and so did Android expert Mishaal Rahman in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1868798147989844270" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). It isn't the only previously-covered feature to appear as part of the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20notification%20cooldown,it%20can%20be%20super%20annoying.">Notification cooldowns</a>, which were originally thought to be an Android 16 feature, are also working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Before the Google Pixel 9 series was officially revealed, I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">already looking ahead to the Pixel 10</a>. That’s because the Pixel 10 is expected to gain a major performance boost since the Tensor G5 chip is expected to be fabricated using TSMC’s 3nm process. To my surprise, Google managed to ship a quite compelling product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. Regardless, the Pixel 10 is still something to be excited about — even with this new wild card.</p><p>There’s a part of your smartphone that is absolutely crucial to how you use it to connect with others, access your favorite apps and sites, and more. It’s also one you probably don’t think about often: the modem. According to Android Authority, Google is reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tipped-to-bring-mediatek-5g-modem-to-pixel-10-series" target="_blank">exploring a switch from Samsung modems to a MediaTek modem on the Pixel 10</a>, and it could have significant implications.</p><p>High-speed, reliable 5G modems are hard to come by, and only a few companies in the world can make them. Qualcomm dominated the space for years and still dominates to an extent. However, due to cost and other reasons, smartphone manufacturers have been trying to move away from Qualcomm modems.</p><p>That leaves Samsung and MediaTek as the only other companies with the capabilities of producing a modern 5G modem. That is, unless it wanted to make its own. Apple is an example of how difficult it is to take that path to building a new modem. It got a head start by purchasing Intel’s mobile modem business in 2019, and five years later, it is still trying to build one reliable and competitive enough to best the Qualcomm ones it uses in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review" target="_blank">iPhone 16 series</a>.</p><p>That’s why it isn’t all that surprising that Google probably won’t make a modem in-house. Developing a custom system-on-a-chip, like Google’s Tensor series, is a different thing entirely. Modems can make or break the smartphone experience, and every switch carries the risk of potential disaster.</p>

<p>For years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-details-pixel-9-modem-security-improvements">Google has used Samsung modems in Pixel phones</a>. The move correlated with the shift to Google’s in-house Tensor processor, which is fabricated by Samsung. The idea is simple — it’s easy to use an Exynos modem with an Exynos chip. The newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> all use Exynos modems to this day, likely for that reason.</p><p>However, all signs point to the next Tensor G5 chip being fabricated by a company other than Samsung. In fact, it’s nearly a lock that the Tensor G5 will be produced using TSMC’s advanced 3nm process node. Back in July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Google reportedly gave the green light to manufacture the Tensor G5</a> on TSMC’s 3nm process. If easy integration and cost were reasons for Google using Samsung modems, they wouldn’t be applicable to future Pixels now that Google is moving away from using Samsung Foundry for Tensor chipmaking.</p><p>That means Google is poised to make a switch, and its choice will be an interesting one. After all, only a handful of brands use external modems. Qualcomm integrates its modems with its systems-on-a-chip, so any phone using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor will also feature a Qualcomm modem. So, Google could purchase an external modem from either Samsung, Qualcomm, or MediaTek to pair with its Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Google reportedly settled on MediaTek, specifically on using an unannounced MediaTek T900 modem in the Pixel 10 series. Per the report, it considered a few options, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm’s X75 modem</a>, in its upcoming phones. It’s unclear what led Google to decide on MediaTek modems, but efficiency and cost are presumably two large factors. The tight integration between Samsung’s 5G modems and Google’s Tensor processors can be partially attributed to the excellent efficiency and battery life offered by Pixel phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s impossible to say how the MediaTek T900 modem will perform compared to the top options from Samsung and Qualcomm, considering it’s not even available yet. Additionally, since MediaTek, Samsung, and Qualcomm all integrate their in-house modems with their SoCs, there isn’t a lot of data covering how they’d perform as external modems.</p><p>With that caveat in mind, there’s still an adage that I think applies in this case: if it ain’t broke, don’t fit it. Google has found a great balance between 5G performance and efficiency with its current Samsung Exynos modems, and disrupting that carries a huge risk. Of course, it was probably inevitable since Google would disrupt the easy integration of Samsung-produced chips and modems when it moved to TSMC on the Tensor G5.</p><p>In that case, why not shoot for the best and use Qualcomm modems? The Qualcomm X75 is still clearly the industry standard for 5G modem technology, and it’s found inside the iPhone 16 series. Crucially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/qualcomm-achieves-world-s-fastest-5g-downlink-with-sub-6-ghz-ban" target="_blank">the X75 achieved the world record</a> for the fastest 5G downlink. It’s an absolutely fantastic modem that’s reliable, and it beats anything that MediaTek, Samsung, and Apple currently have the ability to make.</p><p>I'll reiterate that while the reasons behind the MediaTek move will probably never be known, it’s likely that cost is a driving factor. In that case, I’m disappointed. Pixel phones are not exactly cheap anymore, and going for the best 5G modem available would’ve given Google even more credibility as a manufacturer of some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Google went the cheap route. Only time will tell whether that was the right or wrong decision. The modem is a part of your phone you hope you don’t have to think about. If this move works out in Google’s favor, no one will talk about the new modem on the Pixel 10.</p><p>However, it’s a move Google can’t afford to get wrong. It could completely undermine the real progress it’ll make with Tensor G5 on the Pixel 10.</p>

<ul><li>TECNO recently held its Future Lens 2024 event in China.</li><li>The company unveiled new Image Matrix that will use AI to enhance images using a multi-layered process.</li><li>TECNO also revealed features that will enhance telephoto images and photos of fast-moving subjects.</li><li>These features are expected to appear in a new TECNO smartphone in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tecno-pioneers-ai-imaging-with-unveiling-of-tecno-image-matrix-and-two-ai-powered-imaging-technologies-at-future-lens-2024-302324650.html">unveiled</a> its latest AI efforts during its Future Lens 2024 event in China, which aim to enhance mobile photography and overcome major pain points for users when taking photos.</p><p>At the helm of these is TECNO's new Image Matrix, which will be the backbone of a new imaging process. The Image Matrix will take a multi-layered approach to imaging, working to enhance a photo at each step. This, of course, starts at the hardware level, utilizing the camera hardware, display, chipset, and sensor to capture the image. The image is then deconstructed using as many as 10 different algorithms, focusing on various aspects of the image, such as noise reduction, focus, tone adjustment, detection, and more.</p>
<p>The Image Matrix takes that information and reconstructs the image using the TECNO Algorithm Process Stack (TAPS), which powers several different image processing engines to enhance speed, low-light performance, skin tone, and more. The final layer is the application layer, where the final output is available for use with TECNO's other imaging features for further enhancement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.11%;"><img id="FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ" name="TECNO-Image-matrix" alt="TECNO Image Matrix details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO is also introducing some unique methods that aim to improve high-speed image capture and zooming. The first, dubbed EVS Dynamic Snapshot, tracks and records the motion of a subject at a high frequency, then combines static and motion image data to ensure that the resulting image remains sharp at the pixel level. This feature is ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects such as athletes or vehicles in motion, promising a clearer image than you would get using traditional methods with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">other premium Android phones</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SAvEw1CVds" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Finally, TECNO's Tap Any Zoom feature utilizes a dual prism telephoto design to better frame subjects when zooming in. According to TECNO, a user can double-tap a subject, and the camera will select the appropriate zoom level to keep it in the frame. Additionally, the lens-shift optical image stabilization will let you zoom into virtually any particular section of the frame, keeping the subject in focus with minimal camera shake, even at high magnification levels, to ensure your subject remains in the frame.</p><p>And with telephoto sweep, users can stitch together multiple telephoto images for a high-quality ultrawide-angle image with out the distortion often found in traditional wide-angle cameras. This also makes it possible to easily recompose a shot while retaining a high-quality image.</p>

<p>In the image below, you can see how the photo utilizes both EVS and Tap Any Zoom by automatically framing the biker in the shot while keeping the fast-moving subject in focus. The result is a stark contrast from the image without these features enabled.</p>

<h2 id="coming-soon-2">Coming soon</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">announced a suite of features</a> that it's bringing to its smartphones as part of its efforts to bring "practical AI" to consumers. This means focusing on features that will make it easy to summarize, translate, and create content for users. These new camera-focused features are the latest approach to using AI to further enhance its devices, which can help bridge the gap between high-end and low-end smartphones.</p><p>TECNO is well-versed in emerging markets by launching impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a> in regions where consumers may not be able to spend exorbitant amounts of money on tech. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">Phantom V Fold 2</a> are just two examples of great phones that undercut the competition by a significant margin, with the latter in particular impressing us with its imaging capabilities. By utilizing AI to enhance camera quality, the company is basically saying you don't need to spend a ton of money to capture a good image. Furthermore, the company hinted that we could see more AI imaging capabilities down the road, although for now, it is focused on bringing these features to market.</p><p>Fortunately, we may not have to wait too long to see these features in action. TECNO says these features will arrive sometime in 2025 on an upcoming smartphone.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of its ChromeOS M131 update for Chromebooks, which includes a "Safety Reset" for users.</li><li>Another major inclusion is Flash notifications: a function that will flash a user's screen to ensure they don't miss important alerts.</li><li>Google pushed M130 for Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus models in November with several AI features and OS-level security tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is returning with another update for its Chromebooks with a few new features to shore up its major November patch.</p><p>A Chromebook <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/313128087?hl=en&s=31">community post</a> highlighted the update titled ChromeOS M131, which should start hitting devices today (Dec 16). While this update is lighter than the M130, Google is detailing a feature for Chromebooks called <strong>ChromeOS Back to Safety</strong>. As the title implies, the set of tools is intended to give users a clear look at the state of their laptop's security and ways to improve their online/device safety.</p><p>The primary function of this feature is "Safety Reset." Google's on-device description states Safety Reset will "help remove unwanted pop-ups, fix network issues, and address other unexpected issues." Specifically, this safety-focused refresh can reset your Chrome shortcuts, delete cookies, and temporary site data.</p><p>Google adds that Back to Safety will inform users of extensions they should disable and reset settings that could pose a threat to their device. Moreover, Safety Reset will not touch your bookmarks, history, or saved passwords.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.47%;"><img id="FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh" name="google-chrome-os-m131-flash-notifications" alt="Google's ChromeOS M131 brings Flash notifications to Chromebooks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="755" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeOS M131 is also adding a tool to help bring more awareness to your alerts via <strong>Flash notifications</strong>. Added into the Audio and Captions page of the Accessibility settings on your Chromebook, Google states Flash notifications will flicker or "flash the screen when you receive notifications." The company states this feature could be useful for those who utilize screen magnification or for the hard of hearing.</p><p>Moreover, it seems these Flash notifications can be colored. The settings option for it indicates a "flash screen color" with a drop down menu. Google didn't deliver specifics; however, we can see that a user's screen could quickly flash yellow to grab your attention.</p><p>Google also states that light-sensitive users should take caution should they enable this feature.</p><p>The final portion of M131 includes a restyling update for ChromeOS' AI-powered Quick Answers. Google reiterates that these responses provide the user with useful information via summaries, interactive outlines, and document Q&A. A separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/13616580">support document</a> states Quick Answers is accessible when right-clicking and can provide tools such as spell check, definitions, translations, and unit conversions.</p><p>ChromeOS M131 is rolling out today (Dec 16), so users should keep their eyes open as we go through the week.</p><p>This light M131 update adds a little more to what Chromebook and Chromebook Plus users experienced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">the huge M130 patch</a>. Chromebook Plus devices gained several AI features like "Help me read," which assist users by getting to the core of an article or lengthy passage of text without them needing to read through it. The feature also includes a freeform Q&A function for follow-up questions.</p><p>Additionally, all Chromebook devices picked up OS-level privacy features in Chrome.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is pushing One UI 7 beta 2 to Galaxy S24 devices in the U.S., packed with loads of bug fixes.</li><li>Among the fixes, beta 2 is correcting malfunctions with the Now Bar, issues with TV product connections over DeX, and more.</li><li>Samsung finally opened its One UI 7 beta program on December 5, which introduced the Now Bar on the lock screen.</li><li>One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25 in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems enrolled One UI 7 beta testers can begin to expect the next iteration of software today (Dec 16).</p><p>Android Central has started receiving the update today on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> bearing software version <strong>ZXL5</strong>. Samsung detailed the rollout of the One UI 7 beta 2 update in its Members app, highlighting improved "system stability." The second beta packs quite a few fixes to bugs that testers have encountered since the program's start.</p><p>According to the changelog, Samsung states it has fixed a Quick Panel operation error alongside a display error regarding the "personal drawer App." Another bug fix rolling in is for the Galaxy S24's wireless connection to TV products through DeX. The company is also fixing an issue where "reminder widget transparency is not applied." However, the company states that an app update is required for that fix to go into effect.</p><p>The One UI 7 beta 2 patch informs users of app updates when the software is available. Tapping "view more" will likely take you to where you can update apps that require it post-download.</p><p>Another bug fix arrives for Samsung's newly unveiled Now Bar. The patch notes state it has corrected a "continuous display error and malfunction" after closing it.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:424px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:141.51%;"><img id="JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N" name="samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-bug-fixes-alt" alt="The changelog for One UI 7 beta 2 on the Galaxy S24 series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="424" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the update spotted, other users enrolled in the One UI 7 beta program should soon expect it. Additionally, those just getting involved in the second beta can expect a huge 4GB download. However, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-rollout-3509206/">Android Authority</a>, those who've been enrolled since the beta's beginning will only download a 1GB patch as Samsung progresses its development. The publication also cites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1868601315875787203">Max Jambor</a> in stating the update was spotted in Germany, the U.K., and South Korea alongside the U.S.</p><p>Users can head into the <strong>Samsung Members app > One UI 7 Beta Program banner </strong>to view the full changelog or provide testing feedback.</p><p>Samsung dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the One UI 7 beta</a> earlier in December after the software faced an insurmountable amount of delays. Based on Android 15, the beta opened access to those with a Galaxy S24 series devices with the possibility of hitting others and a few past-gen phones.</p><p>Galaxy AI is at the core of this beta, with Samsung providing an early glimpse at Writing Tools: a set of AI-based writing and grammar options. The Now Bar was another major addition as users can find it incorporated as a significant feature on the lock screen. Users can view "important notifications dynamically" without opening their phones.</p><p>The stable version of One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25's launch in January 2025.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Prominent analyst Ross Young has shared all the color variants of the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The device is likely to ship in new Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold colorways next to conventional color options.</li><li>The new ones are presumably sold as online exclusives, while the traditional ones would be widely available online and in stores.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is anticipated to launch sometime in January 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 launch might just be around the corner. It is assumed to be happening on January 22, although the company has yet to confirm the date. Meanwhile, new information reveals all the possible colorways of the Ultra model in the lineup.</p><p>The news comes from the display analyst Ross Young on X, who has shared the alleged color variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra model. According to Young, we should likely see the Galaxy S25 Ultra in the following color options:</p>
<ul><li>Titanium Black</li><li>Titanium SilverBlue</li><li>Titanium Gray</li><li>Titanium WhiteSilver</li><li>Titanium JetBlack</li><li>Titanium JadeGreen</li><li>Titanium PinkGold</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Updated S25U colors in order of volume:Titanium BlackTitanium SilverBlueTitanium GrayTitanium WhiteSilverTitanium JetBlackTitanium JadeGreenTitanium PinkGold<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1868492364270199211">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-25-ultra-color-options-leaked">earlier leak</a> and also a new Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">carrier listing</a> have revealed some of these color options. While Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium were already expected color variants just like the previous iteration models, the new ones that will likely take the limelight might be the new JetBlack and PinkGold. There are several JetBlack enthusiasts, and it could be on the likes of the Galaxy S23's Phantom Black or maybe even calling back to the iPhone 7.</p><p>The Pink Gold colorway, on the other hand, is not new to Samsung devices; older smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> featured Pink Gold, and we expect the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra to likely incorporate the same or more pinkish to catch up to its counterparts like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p>

<p>Young has further shared that the aforementioned color options list are ranked by the number of units, which means the first few are likely to be widely available across online and offline stores, and presumably, the new ones at the bottom are more likely to be Samsung's online-exclusive units.</p><p>Aside from these colorways, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">thanks to the renders</a>, we have an idea of how the Galaxy S25 Ultra would appear. The handset will likely sport a more flatter design than the predecessor model and be slightly lighter to hold in hand than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced Gemini 2.0 last week, its newest set of models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental.</li><li>The experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, a lightweight and fast model, became immediately available in the Gemini web client.</li><li>Now, Google is starting to bring the latest model to the Gemini app, adding support for Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental in the most recent beta update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">debuted Gemini 2.0 last week</a>, and now, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model is starting to make its way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">mobile Gemini app</a>. The full suite of models is yet to be released, as Google is only making an “experimental” version of Gemini 2.0 Flash. The new, experimental model launched on the Gemini web client immediately, but Google said it would soon come to the official mobile apps.</p><p>Only a few days later, Google is beginning to roll out the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model as part of the latest Gemini app beta, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/gemini-2-0-flash-app-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Previously, the way to access Gemini Advanced models was to enable an option in settings. Now, with version 15.50 of the Gemini app, there is a new way to switch between models. You can top the model name at the top of the landing page to switch between models and learn more about them.</p><p>Expectedly, Google describes Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental as its “latest experimental model,” adding that it “might not work as expected.” Conversely, Gemini 1.5 Pro is “for complex tasks” and Gemini 1.5 Flash is a way to “get everyday help.” The company clearly wants users to know that this experimental version of Gemini 1.5 Flash is not a final release.</p><p>“While we’re excited for you to try it, remember it’s an early preview and might not work as expected,” the company warned in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. “Additionally, some Gemini features won't be compatible with this model in its experimental state.”</p>

<p>On top of that, the option will only be available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscribers. The higher tier is available through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a>, which costs $20 per month. Aside from Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, the subscription also unlocks Google’s other top AI models, like Gemini 1.5 Pro.</p><p>You can try Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental today by enrolling in the Google app beta via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox/join" target="_blank">this link</a>. Otherwise, the option to use this model should become available through the stable channel soon.</p>

<ul><li>Early Access program members are getting three key new features for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</li><li>"Live AI" will record video and offer AI insights based on what you see, a feature originally shown at Meta Connect 2024.</li><li>"Live translate" will let you hear or see people's Spanish, French, or Italian words in English.</li><li>Ray-Ban Metas also added Shazam integration with the v11 update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> are about to get a major intelligence update, and you won't have to wait if you're an Early Access program member.</p><p>On Monday, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam/">announced the v11 update</a>, with <strong>Live AI</strong> as the standout feature.  Until now, Meta AI could only respond to "Hey Meta" queries by taking a single photo and analyzing it. Now, "Meta AI can see what you see continuously and converse with you more naturally than ever before."</p><p>During a Live AI session, it'll record video and analyze what it sees in real time. You can ask it questions without the Hey Meta wake word, and the AI will remember things you asked earlier. You can also "interrupt anytime to ask follow-up questions or change topics," and Meta promises that the AI will proactively "give useful suggestions even before you ask."</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it's because Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> offers similar conversational AI, with interruptions and remembered queries. But that's tied to your Android phone, whereas Meta's Live AI will let you ask questions without needing to hold anything.</p><p>During Meta Connect 2024 in October, Zuckerberg gave an example of using Live AI to look at your closet and ask which clothes would best fit a Roaring 20s-themed costume party. We'll have to test how well it works in practice, but the concept is intriguing and a big step up for the smart glasses.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7JyydkqDeI?start=1717" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The second v11 update feature is <strong>Live translate</strong>, which Zuckerberg demoed at Meta Connect 2024. As the name suggests, you can speak in English with someone speaking Spanish, French, or Italian and either see their responses on your phone or hear them through the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' speakers.</p><p>Google has offered live translate for years, and in more languages. Meta's version is unique because of its hands-free option, but the translation delay will still make conversations a bit awkward (based on Zuckerberg's Connect demo).</p><p>The final v11 update is <strong>Shazam integration</strong>. You'll simply say, "Hey Meta, Shazam this song," and find out what the music playing around you is.</p><p>If you want to test these features today, you'll need to sign up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/voice-controls/early-access-program-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">Early Access program</a>, or else wait for the final release. That link walks you through the steps, but all you really need to do is opt in from the Settings menu of the Meta View app. Otherwise, the stable version should arrive in early 2025.</p><p>Meta has pushed out several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">useful AI updates</a> in recent months, such as the ability to ask Meta AI to "remember" something — such as where you parked — and have it photograph the relevant thing and create a reminder for later.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> on the horizon, Meta is wisely pushing out iterative AI updates on its display-free smart glasses for now, getting Meta AI ready for the next generation and challenging Google Gemini and its nascent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR platform</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google starts the week with a new AI experiment in Labs that U.S. users can start signing up for.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/httpsbloggoogletechnologygoogle-labswhisk/">Keyword post</a>, the newest test for Labs is called "Whisk" and goes about image generation in a new way: by letting users "prompt with images." This is an alternative to writing a detailed description, in case the words aren't flowing. Google explains that its newest model, Whisk, which leverages Gemini and Imagen 3, "extracts only a few key characteristics from your image."</p><p>To get started, the company says users must provide three images for the following areas: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>The AI model is said to consider everything to generate a new "unique" image, like a Whimsical Walrus or an image of a pink donut enamel pin. However, Google warns that its AI only considers things to capture the "essence" of whatever images the user has uploaded to Whisk.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyFDztZxlEc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google says that this design is intentional as Whisk <em>will not </em>replicate whatever you've uploaded to the letter. The post adds that certain aspects of your images, such as subject height, hairstyle, and skin tone might vary, too. It understands that these attributes are important to users, which is why Google says Whisk gives users a "review and edit" feature after generation.</p><p>The company adds that this AI model is intended to give users a quicker experience with image generation than the typical methods. Moreover, Whisk lets users "remix" the images they've added to the creation tool for another round of ideas. After an image is created — using Gemini's model — Whisk will create a "detailed" description of what it created.</p><p>Labs testers in the U.S. can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/whisk">sign up today</a> (Dec 16) for Whisk and try it out.</p>

<p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/video-image-generation-update-december-2024/">blog post</a>, Google detailed new versions of Veo 2 and Imagen 3. Beginning with the latter, the post says Imagen 3 has been updated to produce "brighter" and "better composed" images. Imagen 3 can reportedly follow your descriptions (prompts) better than before with richer details in its final renders.</p><p>The newest version of Imagen 3 is rolling out today (Dec 16) globally in ImageFX in Google Labs.</p><p>The latest updates to Imagen 3 arrive just before the year's end <em>and </em>several months <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">after its (quiet) U.S. launch</a>. Google started making its AI image generator available to users more prominently in August on its Vertex AI platforms. The company touts its safety precautions in place to avoid the creation of illegal or otherwise offensive imagery through Imagen 3.</p><p>Elsewhere, Veo 2 is receiving an update that widens the AI video generator's horizons. Google states this new version of Veo 2 lets users create "incredibly high-quality" videos for a "wide range of subjects and styles." Veo 2 can reportedly reach resolutions heights of 4K and it can supposedly understand more detailed descriptions of what you want.</p><p>The company gives the example of a user telling Veo 2 to utilize an "18mm lens" and states the AI will understand how to replicate a wide angled shot. Moreover, its understanding of expressions, movements, and more help to facilitate a more engrossed AI-generated video experience.</p><p>Google also states that Veo 2's latest updates help it hallucinate details "less frequently."</p><p>Today (Dec 16), Veo 2's update is rolling out in Google Labs' VideoFX and the company is slowly expanding the number of test participants. If you're interested, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/video-fx">signup on the waitlist</a>. Google then teased its plans to bring Veo 2 to YouTube Shorts and "other products" next year. Plans for YouTube incorporation are something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">we heard about earlier this year</a>.</p>
