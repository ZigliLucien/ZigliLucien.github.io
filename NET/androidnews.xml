                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve always been a fan of the iPad, and in the last four years, I used several iterations of the iPad Air extensively. My use case centers around reading, taking notes, and streaming videos occasionally, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-air-m1-long-term-review">iPad Air M1</a> manages to do these things incredibly well.</p><p>At the start of last year, I wanted a portable device that would allow me to be productive on the go, and while the 10.9-inch panel on the iPad Air was decent enough, I needed something larger, so I switched to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At the outset, I didn&apos;t think there would be a lot of difference between the two other than the larger screen; both models have powerful hardware, a similar design, and the same software.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="urkHw7qWSwSA27StWDyuBi" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-5.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/urkHw7qWSwSA27StWDyuBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I was wrong. The iPad Pro 12.9 is noticeably better than the iPad Air; the mini-LED panel gets brighter and has much better contrast, and HDR content looks amazing on the device. While I didn&apos;t pay attention to this at the time, the quad speakers on the iPad Pro sound much better.</p><p>The biggest difference is the screen refresh, with the iPad Pro getting ProMotion tech that allows it to go up to 120Hz. The iPad Air is limited to 60Hz, and it is immediately evident when using both devices next to each other. And because of the larger size, there&apos;s a bigger battery that lasts noticeably longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5MuFXmLBtHyikTJbpk57Ni" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-6.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MuFXmLBtHyikTJbpk57Ni.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main reason for using the iPad Pro is for productivity, and it has been terrific in that regard. For most of the last decade, I followed the same schedule: get up at 6am, finish the day&apos;s writing tasks, and then get started with my day. That isn&apos;t the case now; my wife and I had a baby last year, and I write whenever I find the time — my ten-month-old dictates my schedule.</p><p>So I had to learn to do something I&apos;m not very good at: flexibility. I couldn&apos;t just lock myself away in my home office and write for hours on end, so I needed something portable. I have a lot of Windows machines, but I wanted something that had a touchscreen and a modular design with plenty of accessories, and that led me to the iPad Pro.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sfHNhhf5La9GEBH2ENWYVi" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-8.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sfHNhhf5La9GEBH2ENWYVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the last 10 months, a full 40% of my writing was done on the iPad Pro, and I didn&apos;t think I would use the device anywhere as much. The screen is the ideal size — it&apos;s almost the same size as most 13-inch notebooks — and as it has Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, I was able to add a docking station and connect my mechanical keyboard without any hassle.</p><p>But a big part of why I used the iPad Pro to the extent I did was the Magic Keyboard; the $349 keyboard accessory costs more than most mechanical keyboards, but it is terrific. It attaches securely, has good adjustability, and the keyboard itself is decent; the scissor keys have 1mm travel and are backlit, and they&apos;ve held up well after nearly a year of use. The trackpad also comes in handy, and it&apos;s just easier to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LL2NwL69AKSTZAGFDWehui" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-17.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LL2NwL69AKSTZAGFDWehui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the iPad Pro 12.9 is ideally suited for my use case. While iPadOS doesn&apos;t have anywhere close to the productivity features that are available in macOS, that hasn&apos;t been an issue — multitasking isn&apos;t something I&apos;m looking for in a portable machine. For the tasks I do daily — writing, editing photos, and reading — the iPad Pro is a stellar option. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> have similar hardware, but most of these options are limited to Samsung, and while I tolerate One UI on phones, I don&apos;t have any intention of using it on a larger device. </p><p>There were weeks when I used the iPad Pro exclusively, and the only issue in doing so was the convoluted file access within iPadOS; other than that, it proved to be a reliable powerhouse. The Magic Keyboard in particular unlocks the full potential of the iPad Pro, but the only quibble with it is that the fabric design doesn&apos;t quite match up to its premium asking price. Thankfully, it looks like that&apos;s going to change with the 2024 iteration of the iPad Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei" name="ipad-pro-2022-129-16.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 12.9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qi9dBKgZ36vQhoTe2Lmiei.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this is a secondary consideration, the iPad Pro is great for creative use cases. There&apos;s no analog to Procreate on Android or Windows, and the drawing utility is incredible. I dabble in music production, and iPadOS has an extensive collection of synths and drum machines, and the larger screen definitely makes a difference in this regard — as does the ability to connect accessories.</p><p>With new iPads inbound, I&apos;m excited to see what&apos;s in store this year. The switch to OLED panels and better software features should give the upcoming iPad Pro a distinct advantage over the MacBook, and I can&apos;t wait to see how the series evolves.</p>

<p>In an age where fitness watches and smart rings use passive health data and hidden algorithms to judge your health and athleticism, Polar takes a direct user approach. The Vantage V3 has a dedicated section for "Tests" on everything from nightly recovery and ECGs to VO2 Max. And while automatic tracking is more futuristic, I&apos;m a fan of this alternative.</p><p>The annoying part of buying any new smartwatch is the learning period. You&apos;re promised the equivalent of a constant doctor&apos;s physical and a PE test on your wrist. But once you put it on, you&apos;ll wear it for days, if not weeks, before the software will share its findings or properly gauge your health and fitness level. </p><p>Blame my inability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep soundly while wearing a smartwatch</a> or the fact that this job makes me switch watches every few weeks, but it&apos;s difficult for me to sustain interest in a new product long enough to take advantage of these features or remember to seek out the information once it&apos;s finally ready. </p><p>On the fitness side, I can&apos;t tell you how often VO2 Max data on a smartwatch is woefully incorrect from the start, based on run data that couldn&apos;t possibly provide the insight necessary to make that kind of judgment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-cardio-load-status.jpeg" alt="A Cardio Load Status screen of "Overreaching" on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odZYj8gmDnysxUmGUH2mzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polar isn&apos;t so different from these other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands in that it&apos;ll also measure your VO2 Max, nightly recharge, and other data passively over time. But it also lets you take that into your own hands, so to speak, with its active testing section. </p><p>I can look at my "Cardio Load Status" to see whether Polar&apos;s algorithm thinks I&apos;m ready to work out or "overreaching" based on my abilities. But if the estimate doesn&apos;t match my <em>perceived</em> energy level, Polar has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.polar.com/e_manuals/vantage-v/polar-vantage-v-user-manual-english/content/orthostatic-test.htm" target="_blank">orthostatic test</a> that takes a snapshot of my heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest or while standing.</p><p>A full night of HRV data will give Polar more data to work with. But if you don&apos;t sleep with your Polar or wear a different tracker to bed (like my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>), this gives you the info necessary for a judgment call after four minutes of relaxation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-orthostatic-test-result.jpeg" alt=""Test result: your cardio system is recovered" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RAscUPWcbQ7e9SY5apSk5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Despite "Overreaching" on my training, my orthostatic test found that my body isn't as tired as the algorithm thinks.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even better, Polar has a "leg stiffness" test that measures your muscular recovery after runs. </p><p>Every post-run marathoner knows the feeling when their heart has recovered but their legs need another week. Other times, my legs feel fine, but my worn-down heart treats a jog like a sprint. Despite that, most fitness watches lump together cardiovascular and muscular recovery by necessity.</p><p>It&apos;d be nice if these watches could use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">running form analysis</a> to adjust recovery time. I&apos;m sure tired muscles affect our vertical lift or cadence or could make our stride imbalanced. In lieu of that, Polar has you jump up and down three times with your hands on your hips. After a couple of tests, it&apos;ll have a baseline for your normal jumping abilities; if you fall short, you know you&apos;re not ready for a hard run. </p><p>I appreciate that Polar lets me check my physical recovery for myself instead of relying blindly on the algorithm. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-vo2-max-running-test.jpeg" alt="The VO2 Max running test on the Polar Vantage V3; showing a target pace, current pace, current/max heart rate, and other data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYBUfkVDoi4bDKBb3hmKSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then we have my absolute favorite: Polar&apos;s VO2 Max running test. I first tried it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-pro-review">Polar Pacer Pro</a>, one of my first running watch reviews, and I&apos;ve happily returned to it now that I&apos;m testing the Vantage V3. Essentially, it has you slowly pick up your pace from 15:00/mile downwards until you can no longer keep up, for about 10–15 minutes of easy-to-all-out running.</p><p>I ended up tiring out as I hit the sub-6:00 pace window and was rewarded with a 53. For context, that&apos;s two points higher than my Garmin VO2 Max average (51). Polar calls it "Very Good" for my age and gender, while Garmin would call it "Excellent." Either way, it&apos;s an improvement on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">where my VO2 Max was a year ago</a>.</p><p>I don&apos;t know which is more accurate; Garmin works from months of data, while Polar uses the traditional self-guided method. The only <em>definitive</em> way would be to go to a testing lab that measures your breathing on a treadmill. </p><p>Frankly, it doesn&apos;t matter to me which is better. I just want multiple ways to test for myself.</p>

<p>Raising your VO2 Max is a long, arduous process of increasing your training load week by week; the more you improve, the longer it takes to gain a point. At times, I&apos;ve questioned whether or not I&apos;m <em>actually</em> improving or if my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> and its algorithm merely reward me for following the training load suggestions. </p><p>That&apos;s why having a way to spot-check your VO2 Max is so heartening. Seeing that 53 validated all of the hard track runs and boring low-aerobic jogs I&apos;ve done to try and improve over the past year. </p><p>It also triggered my competitive side: next time I do a manual VO2 Max test, I&apos;m not going to <em>let</em> myself get left behind until I push further into the 5:XX range and score higher!</p>

<p>Whichever smartwatch brand you buy, you must trust its algorithm, with no way to tweak the numbers or peek behind the curtain. You must have faith in a brand&apos;s reputation, and then spend weeks or months finding out whether the algorithm truly understands your fitness level and how often you need rest.</p><p>But even with the most reliable brand, worn for a long time, it doesn&apos;t always get things perfectly right. And that&apos;s to be expected!</p><p>Polar&apos;s algorithm isn&apos;t any more imperfect than other brands&apos; data. But the Vantage V3&apos;s testing suite caters to athletes who want to double-check Polar&apos;s suggestions for themselves, especially in the early days of using the watch, and I appreciate that Polar doesn&apos;t insist on blind trust — as other brands do.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&apos;ll have my Polar Vantage V3 review completed by next week. Thus far, it did pretty well in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-vertix-2s-vs-garmin-forerunner-965-vs-polar-vantage-v3-fitness-test">fitness test against COROS and Garmin</a>. I appreciate its comfortable design and straightforward access to specific tools — like Tests — with one or two button presses. </p><p>More pertinent to this discussion, I&apos;m hopeful that Polar will continue to expand this testing section over time. It has running, walking, and cycling fitness tests, all variations on the same theme, along with recovery tests. Maybe Polar could offer a hill/stair climber test to see how well you handle elevation gain or an arm strength test to go with its indoor exercise recommendations. </p><p>Dedicated athletes are competitive people, and when you give them a way to test and compete against themselves and their own fitness scores, that&apos;s always a recipe for success. </p>

<hr>
<p>Spotify recently made the news cycle for two big reasons. First, the company posted a campaign on X (formerly Twitter) outlining the reasons why it believes Apple is anti-competitive. Later, a leak revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-lossless-audio-expectation-leak">more information about Spotify&apos;s upcoming high-fidelity offering</a>, which has been in development since at least 2021. While other services like Apple Music and Tidal have had Hi-Fi support for years, Spotify notably still hasn&apos;t managed to ship it. </p><p>The fact that these two headlines broke within a day of each other highlights Spotify&apos;s strange hierarchy of priorities. It has spent years going to war with Apple, both through the legal system and through public campaigns. This is all while, in some ways, Spotify&apos;s actual product lags behind the competition. Spotify has key advantages, such as excellent discovery algorithms and superb sharing features. However, the lack of Hi-Fi and advanced features looms large in 2024.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’ve heard us talk about Apple’s anticompetitive practices—but what does that actually mean and why do we care so much? Here’s a break down and if you want to learn more head to: https://t.co/DP28elipIo pic.twitter.com/psrEpZPBXj<a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1786093384353878124">May 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Apple seems to be coming under fire from all angles, with governments and competitors claiming antitrust violations or anti-competitive practices—and in some cases, deservedly so. But the points Spotify outlines on its website leave out parts of the story. Although it would seem that Spotify is in a great market position, it isn&apos;t—and Spotify may be more to blame for that than Apple.  </p>
<h2 id="apple-is-changing-so-what-apos-s-stopping-spotify-2">Apple is changing, so what&apos;s stopping Spotify?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF" name="Spotify-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify Premium on an Android phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS4bjbyKmiSYtyq4VFAYJF.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s hard to take Spotify&apos;s position seriously when it makes blatantly misleading claims when trying to convince users and regulators to turn on Apple. On a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timetoplayfair.com/facts/" target="_blank">website</a> that lists five "facts that show Apple doesn&apos;t play fair," Spotify makes statements that appear misleading at best and intentionally false at worst.</p><p>The company says that Apple charges a discriminatory tax, but Spotify is referencing the fee that Apple charges developers who use its in-app purchase system, which can be as high as 30%. Apple would counter this point <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/the-app-store-spotify-and-europes-thriving-digital-music-market/">saying</a> that 86% of developers don&apos;t pay any fees, including Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify also says that Apple won&apos;t let it "share Spotify deals we know you&apos;d love," referring to an outdated App Store policy known as anti-steering, which is generally considered to be anti-competitive. However, now, Apple&apos;s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">App Review Guidelines</a> permit Spotify to show deals to users outside of the in-app purchase system, as long as it offers IAP as an option. </p>
<p>Additionally, Spotify says Apple won&apos;t let users easily upgrade to Spotify Premium, but this is false. Spotify has chosen not to offer in-app purchases on Apple platforms as a way to avoid the company&apos;s App Store fees. Spotify also does not let users buy audiobooks through its Apple apps to avoid paying in-app purchase fees.</p>
<p>Finally, Spotify says that Apple "routinely reject[s] our bug fixes and app enhancements." We&apos;re not sure exactly what this means because the company doesn&apos;t share specifics, but Apple has the right to deny updates or app submissions as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/terms/apple-developer-agreement/Apple-Developer-Agreement-20230605-English.pdf">Apple Developer Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>So, it&apos;s easy to see how Spotify and Apple are at odds. Spotify wants to use iOS and the App Store to the fullest extent — and to the same level as Apple Music, for example — without paying App Store and in-app purchase fees.</p>
<h2 id="spotify-has-its-own-problems-to-worry-about-x2014-and-apple-isn-apos-t-one-of-them-2">Spotify has its own problems to worry about — and Apple isn&apos;t one of them</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="kWGZ6wr2t9dDGdmZW7pLEP" name="best-streaming-music-services-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Best music streaming services on the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, and Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWGZ6wr2t9dDGdmZW7pLEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spotify is the global leader among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a>, ahead of Apple Music. Despite having more than five times the number of Apple Music subscribers, Spotify has never posted a full-year net profit, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.barrons.com/news/spotify-passes-600-million-users-expects-profitable-2024-start-94dbb8af" target="_blank">Barron&apos;s</a>. If Spotify has a problem with its business model, Apple isn&apos;t the one to blame. As mentioned earlier, Spotify pays no fees to Apple since it opts out of the in-app purchase program. </p><p>In terms of feature set, Spotify isn&apos;t the clear winner among the music streaming services. Apple Music and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-vs-tidal">Tidal</a> both offer high-fidelity audio, and both include this functionality within their standard subscription plans. Meanwhile, Spotify said that Hi-Fi support would come at some point in 2021. Well, it&apos;s 2024, and the feature Spotify promised years ago still isn&apos;t here.</p><p>Separately, the way Spotify chooses to operate its free tier seems to be causing more friction with potential subscribers than ever. As of this May, the company started putting song lyrics behind a paywall, and people are <em>mad</em>. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1785741402808218052" target="_blank">social media post by Dexerto</a>, thousands of users flooded the comments criticizing Spotify&apos;s decision. </p><p>So, Spotify finds itself in an interesting position. The company isn&apos;t consistently profitable, it isn&apos;t able to deliver features by its self-imposed deadlines, and it is causing friction between Spotify and Spotify users. These are big problems, and it begs the question: doesn&apos;t Spotify have more pressing things to worry about than Apple? </p>
<h2 id="we-can-apos-t-blame-apple-for-everything-2">We can&apos;t blame Apple for everything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7" name="iphone-15-pro-max-18.jpg" alt="iPhone 15 Pro Max review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQA6wo7Mpgr6aTuXKm7UX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple makes plenty of moves that can be considered anti-competitive, and it should face penalties when it takes steps to stifle competition. In many ways, governments and regulators are finally starting to hold Apple in check. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">European Union&apos;s new Digital Markets Act</a> introduced a slew of restrictions that have affected Apple since it was deemed a gatekeeper. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-apple-and-meta-are-under-investigation-in-europe-for-non-compliance-with-the-digital-markets-act">EU opened an investigation into Apple</a> for allegedly skirting DMA requirements. </p><p>Over in the U.S., Epic was successful in a few aspects of its antitrust case against Apple. Epic&apos;s win is the reason why Apple no longer has anti-steering rules in its App Review Guidelines, for example. There are also other pending lawsuits in federal court concerning Apple&apos;s alleged market advantage. </p><p>However, many of Spotify&apos;s examples of ways that Apple is creating an advantage in the music streaming service market are inaccurate. I&apos;m all for holding big tech companies accountable, including Apple. But coming after big companies just because it&apos;s popular isn&apos;t the reason antitrust rules and laws exist. Instead of coming after Apple, Spotify should make its product better — because, in many ways, it&apos;s behind the curve. </p>
<h2 id="where-does-spotify-go-from-here-2">Where does Spotify go from here?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WmnvJ73Rpc4DnYjGjRXFhe" name="Spotify-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-3-Fold-3.jpg" alt="Spotify on the Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 with headphones and earbuds next to them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmnvJ73Rpc4DnYjGjRXFhe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Spotify clearly wants regulation like the DMA, which is intended to prevent companies from giving preferential treatment to their own products and services, to extend worldwide. That might just happen, as the U.S. Department of Justice and the 50 states have launched multiple inquiries or lawsuits related to the practices of big tech companies like Apple and Google.</p><p>However, it&apos;s hard to see what a solution looks like. Apple Music, of course, doesn&apos;t pay a 30% fee for in-app purchases, unlike competitors in music streaming. But Apple can&apos;t pay a fee to itself. So, does Spotify want Apple to waive App Store fees across the board? In that scenario, Apple is paying for all the App Store overhead and providing developers valuable customer acquisition prospects without getting anything in return. </p><p>Maybe it could just waive the fee for streaming services like Spotify. It&apos;s an option, but maybe Apple <em>should</em> get an advantage for building entire devices and services from scratch. Remember, it only benefits from platforms it built from the ground up. Apple Music and Spotify compete on an equal playing field on all the others, including Android, Windows, and the web. </p><p>Whatever happens, it&apos;s clear that Spotify can&apos;t count on its situation improving on Apple platforms. It needs to control what it can control, like improving the Spotify experience on all platforms, including iOS and Android. Spending time on its feud with Apple will only divert resources from what actually matters: making Spotify better. </p>

This time, in a fresh round of layoffs, Google let go of 200 of its &apos;core&apos; employees to move faster and align with the company&apos;s goals.</p><p>These core teams were responsible for the technical foundation behind many of Google&apos;s products and services for security and online safety. The company has also reportedly started a "reorganization" that moves roles to India and Mexico.</p><p>Documents obtained by CNBC also suggested that employees found out about these cuts a week before they were announced, with Google stating that it would help it align with its "broader goals." Google&apos;s vice president of its Developer Ecosystem, Asim Husain, informed staff that "this was the biggest planned reduction" for the team in 2024, during a town hall. These cuts come at time, after Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/alphabet-q1-2024-earnings">Q1 earnings report</a> announced a whopping $80.5 billion in revenue with "strong performance" across services. </p><p>Google confirmed these layoffs, and a spokesperson added that those affected can reapply for other roles within the company.</p>

While they don&apos;t churn out smartphones as often as other brands, a new leak indicated that its U24 Pro could give them another entrant in the market.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-htc-u24-pro-spotted.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, it looks like the Taiwanese company might be getting ready to introduce the HTC U24 Pro this month. Even though there&apos;s no official word on the exact date yet, the U23 Pro was launch in May last year, which has could be a reason to expect the same with this year&apos;s addition.</p><p>A few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/htc-u24-2qda100-geekbench-bluetooth-sig-certification/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a> caught sight of a device on Geekbench and speculated that it might belong to the HTC U24 series. The phone has model number 2QDA100, but that doesn&apos;t give away too much.</p><p>On the design front, the HTC U24 Pro will probably look a lot like its predecessor. That said, it might sport a faster processor —the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a>. As for the price, the U23 Pro hit store shelves at $350, and the U24 Pro is likely to stay in that range. We can expect the device to have Android 14 out of the box with either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. </p>

The company also hinted at expanding its Galaxy portfolio by bringing Galaxy AI to "existing and new flagship" products like foldables and tablets. The other side of this business is its wearables, to which Samsung mentions the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>—something that could boost revenue later this year.</p><p>Smartwatches will also play a role, with Samsung stating it will look to "meet demand for upgrades through the launch of new premium models."

While this may not seem like a large gain, it signals healthy growth in the smartphone industry after a bit of a slump just a year ago. By comparison, Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-fy-q2-2023-earnings">FY Q2 2023 earnings</a> revealed a 17% drop in headset and overall revenue, so the recent numbers look positive.</p><p>"We are excited about our continued growth and diversification, including achieving our third consecutive quarter of record QCT Automotive revenues, upcoming launches with our Snapdragon X platforms, and enabling leading on-device AI capabilities across multiple product categories," says Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in a statement.</p><p>With its current chipsets, Qualcomm is focusing on AI, which it expects will enable more use cases in various devices, be they phones, PCs, or cars. The company highlights its AI hub for developers to help drive this adoption.</p><p>"I want to step back and say, in general, I think AI is going to benefit all the devices," Amon says. "I think AI, when extends to running on-device—besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud—they have completely new use cases privacy, security, latency cost, personalization, etc."</p>

<p>A new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> that runs an instance of Gemini Nano is a thing Google could easily create.

<p>You would be left with a screen with a touch interface when you need it, a camera and/or sleep sensor array, a speaker that sounds nice, and apps like Chrome and YouTube to provide a good media experience. The ability to install things like the Netflix or Spotify app could make it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-home-products-under-100">best smart home</a> devices you can buy.</p><p>More importantly, you can replace Google Assistant with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> running on the device. That&apos;s where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a> comes into play, and this would be the best part.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf" name="google-gemini-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Gemini on Android at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FFvZEBujRzeeVAA4ZSMsMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini Nano is when smart AI "stuff" runs mostly on your device without reporting back to the Google mothership. It&apos;s built into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>, powering various tools and all sorts of fancy camera tricks.</p><p>It&apos;s an important step forward for Google&apos;s AI team because, previously, almost everything had to go through the cloud. Google still offers bigger and more powerful AI models like Gemini Ultra that lean heavily on cloud computing, but with Gemini Nano, a mobile CPU, and some extra memory, you can do many things locally.</p>
<p>This is important. Local computing means everything is more private, is done faster, and doesn&apos;t rely on having a good internet connection. I don&apos;t care if Google knows how many times I turn the lights on or off or that I asked what the square root of 15 was (3.87, I saved you a click). I might care about the next smart display feature, though. And if any AI processing is to be done on a camera-equipped device in my bedroom, I&apos;d rather it be locally. I <em>might</em> be able to peel the tape covering the lens off. Might.</p><p>Even better, Gemini can do so many things better and faster than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> can. Yes, I know there are things Assistant can do that Gemini can&apos;t or struggles to get right, but I assure you that Google is working on Gemini and wants to replace Assistant completely. Out with the old, in with the new, even if it doesn&apos;t work 100% of the time. That&apos;s the Google way.</p>

<p>Gemini means a Home Hub can be more than a light switch or a way to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-vs-nest-doorbell-battery">who is knocking on the front door</a>. The way it can parse information and do other things with it is what AI is good at doing, and as a bonus, it can better interpret the things we tell it to do. Here at Chez Hildenbrand, we love to yell out to Google so it can add stuff to the grocery list. Gemini does that better because it understands us better. That&apos;s pretty important for a voice-operated device. I do not doubt that Gemini will eventually power <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart displays</a>.</p><p>This would be in Google&apos;s best interests, too. Sell a Nest Hub "Ultra Max Pro" (or some other silly name) powered by Gemini Nano that does everything advertised on the box. Power users could buy into more powerful versions of the Gemini AI model if they wanted, providing Google finds a way to build compelling features using them.</p>
<p>I used to think replacing a cheap smart display with yet another Android device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-pixel-tablet-isnt-going-to-fix-whats-wrong-with-android-tablets-on-its-own">Pixel Tablet</a> was a bad idea because there was no benefit that was worth the cost. With the release of Gemini Nano, I&apos;m not so sure about that anymore.</p><p>I still want to see a basic (and cheap) Nest Hub that works the same (infuriating) way it works now, but I also want to see more. And better. Google can do this, and it just might if the company thinks it&apos;s something we want to buy. I have a feeling people would want to buy it once they understand why.</p>

It also offers an impressive battery life, easy compatibility with both iOS and Android, and a really pretty overall design. Depending on your price point, you may not mind a few of the Versa 4&apos;s downsides, like how it doesn&apos;t include Google Assistant capabilities, third-party app support, or basic music streaming.</p><p>Either way, $50 off makes this smartwatch pretty appealing, even with its shortcomings.</p>

<p>At 25% off the normal purchase price, the Fitbit Versa 4 is a pretty solid deal, especially if you need a basic, bare-bones smartwatch. From its long battery life and sleek aesthetic to easy compatibility with iOS and Android, the Versa 4 isn't anything too complicated, and that isn't a bad thing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-versa-4-review">Versa 4</a> starts at a fairly reasonable price point, but the extra $50 discount makes it a little easier to overlook some of the watch's downsides.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re just looking for a simple, no-frills fitness smartwatch at a good price; battery life is a big selling point for you; you&apos;re looking for a watch that can resist some water submersion.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t mind paying a little more for a premium smartwatch.</p><p>We called the Versa 4 one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbits</a> that money can buy, and despite a few minor issues and some somewhat dated hardware, it remains a good option for most people, especially when you pair it with a deal like this.</p><p>With its reasonably sized 1.58-inch AMOLED display and super minimal design, this is a pretty good-looking fitness watch overall. The upsides of the Versa 4 also include its over-six-day battery life, quick charging, and a range of basic sensors like GPS, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and more. It&apos;s also highly compatible with iOS and Android, as well as Alexa, though it doesn&apos;t work with Google Assistant. </p><p>Those willing to spend a little extra might consider the Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Sense 2</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>, but at this price point, you really can&apos;t go wrong with the Versa 4, either. </p>

<hr>
<p>The global smartphone market appears to be rebounding, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> especially finding success in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartphone-market-q1-2024/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>.</p><p>Overall, the market grew by six percent year-over-year despite Apple shipping far fewer iPhones last quarter than during Q1 2023. In part, that&apos;s due to the success of Samsung Galaxy phones. A strong launch of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-review">Galaxy A-series smartphones</a> appears to have vaulted Samsung above Apple as the global leader in shipments.</p><p>Samsung is typically the top smartphone manufacturer in terms of total number of shipments, but it lost that title to Apple in Q4 2023. However, as Apple posted a 13% decline in shipments year-over-year in Q1 2024, Samsung was able to recapture the leading position. Samsung devices represented 20% of the total smartphones shipped last quarter, while iPhones slipped to 17%. </p><p>As has been the case in past quarters, the premium smartphone market continues to grow. According to Counterpoint, the market segment, including phones priced above $800, was the fastest to grow in Q1 2024. Apple benefitted big from this trend last quarter because it has the highest average sale price (ASP) of any OEM at $900. This is presumably due to buyers picking the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">15 Pro Max</a> over the base models. </p><p>Additionally, Apple retained its spot as the smartphone revenue leader with a 43% share of the market. Still, that figure is down 11% year-over-year, and there are a few reasons why. </p><p>"Tough competition in China, record low upgrades in the US and a difficult compare from last year due to iPhone 14 Pro&apos;s supply shifting to Q1 2023 all weighed on iPhone performance," says Counterpoint Research Director Jeff Fieldhack. "An improved product mix with 15 Pro&apos;s performing better than its predecessors, and an increasing footprint in emerging markets, helped Apple in arresting some of the declines."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:697px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:135.29%;"><img id="EyAdv5MgabzTB3DXRusxyK" name="그림1.jpg" alt="A chart showing Counterpoint research trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EyAdv5MgabzTB3DXRusxyK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="697" height="943" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The overall growth can be partially attributed to select brands&apos; success in regions outside of North America, including TECNO, Xiaomi, Honor, and Huawei. Of the top five OEMs, Xiaomi grew the most last quarter, improving shipments by 34% year-over-year.</p><p>Looking ahead, the analysts at Counterpoint expect the premium smartphone market to continue growing. This is because of the expected release of new phones with generative AI functionality. Counterpoint predicts that 11% of smartphones shipped will feature generative AI this year. If Apple ends up including gen-AI features on the next iPhone series, joining the likes of Google and Samsung, this will likely end up being the case. </p>

<p>Google rolled out a huge update to Find My Device that brings it closer to the Find My network that&apos;s used by all of Apple&apos;s devices. The tech uses crowdsourced Bluetooth proximity data to locate devices, With billions of Android devices in use worldwide, this significantly increases the accuracy of the service, and if you&apos;re using the Pixel 8 or 8 Pro, it can locate offline devices as well.</p><p>There&apos;s no user intervention needed; Find My Device is enabled out of the box on all Android phones, and if you have location enabled on your phone, it is active from the moment you set up your device. What I like the most about the new features is that it can locate devices inside your home — provided you have a Nest device. The service also includes Bluetooth trackers now, and they&apos;re set to debut later in Q2 2024.</p>

<p>Find My Device is the only tool you&apos;ll need to track your missing phone. The best part is that it comes installed out of the box, and once you set it up, you don&apos;t need to do much with it. </p><p>Having a service like this is handy, but you should also make it a point to jot down your phone&apos;s IMEI and serial numbers. You can never be too careful, and in a scenario where you lose your phone, or it gets stolen, an IMEI number lets you de-register the phone from cellular networks.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Leaks and hints from Samsung point to a Galaxy Watch Ultra watch arriving this summer instead of the long-rumored 7 Pro. We&apos;ll find out the truth at the next Unpacked event; the real question is, what will a Samsung "Ultra" watch look like, and how will it differentiate itself from the Apple Watch Ultra series?</p><p>Last week, I finished my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2 review</a>, saying, "Your move, Samsung," because I hoped the brand would take inspiration from its premium features for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 Pro</a>. Days later, by happy coincidence, Samsung said it would launch "new premium models" of Galaxy Watches with "upgrades" during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2024-earnings-report">Q1 2024 earnings call</a>. Its execs didn&apos;t elaborate, but soon after, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-coming.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> claimed to have spotted "Ultra" and "Fan Edition" watch model names in its One UI beta code.</p><p>I don&apos;t care whether it&apos;s called the Galaxy Watch Ultra, 7 Ultra, or 7 Pro. What matters to me, after reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, is that Samsung gets its "premium" smartwatch right from the start, even if it has to steal tricks from Apple, OnePlus, Garmin, or other brands to do so. </p>
<h2 id="it-should-kick-apple-apos-s-a-in-battery-life-2">It should kick Apple&apos;s a** in battery life</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro launched in 2022 with pretty consistent three-day battery life, but natural capacity drain and annual One UI updates cut into its battery life. My colleague Andrew Myrick, who owns the 80-hour 5 Pro and the 36-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ultra-review-actually-the-best-apple-watch-for-most-people-this-year">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, says his Ultra lasts longer in 2024. </p><p>A Wear OS flagship, Samsung-made or otherwise, will cost as much as a mid-range smartphone if not more. An "Ultra" watch needs the longevity to match, or Samsung&apos;s most loyal customers will feel burned. </p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-could-get-better-battery-life">April Samsung leak</a> indicated its next flagship smartwatch would have a 578mAh capacity, on par with the Watch 5 Pro. We rarely see any watch hit above 600mAh; more capacity would make any watch too thick or heavy. So, how will Samsung make its Ultra last longer than the Pro? I can only think of one option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd" name="oneplus-watch-2-27.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 Play Store icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVMDMJm5Ay4HcPjqHLTtFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS hybrid interface</a> debuted with the 100-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, but any watch can use it. Without diving into minutiae, Wear OS watches can assign background tasks like notifications, watch face data, and heart rate tracking to a low-power co-processor, saving the battery-guzzling tasks for the main processor. </p><p>Almost all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> use a processor and co-processor, but Exynox chips appear to be the exception. The last model&apos;s Exynos W930 chip had dual Cortex-A55 cores, for instance; compare that to the Pixel Watch 2&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a>, which has four Cortex-A53 cores <em>and</em> a 22nm Cortex M55 co-processor. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung watches are fast and long-lasting, but it needs to prove the Galaxy Watch Ultra will still be "premium" four years from now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung watches have excellent, efficient performance speed. Transitioning to a power-saving hybrid system might be harder for Samsung and its Exynos division than its Qualcomm-reliant rivals. </p><p>Maybe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-rumored-to-receive-3nm-exynos-chip">rumored Exynos W940</a> could change that; it&apos;s supposed to be 50% more efficient. But Samsung could easily cancel out that efficiency with more RAM to achieve Ultra-quality speed. </p><p>The other (unlikely) option is for Samsung to add a secondary grayscale screen that kicks in whenever the battery is low. It&apos;s the method used by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 5</a>, and it works really well! But the Samsung display leaks I&apos;ve heard have revolved around squircles or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ultra-micro-led-rumor">micro-LED tech</a>, so I wouldn&apos;t count on it. </p>
<h2 id="i-don-apos-t-know-what-an-quot-ultra-quot-android-watch-looks-like-2">I don&apos;t know what an "Ultra" Android watch looks like</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qcCd5ckDUrYmVrGWSafDMo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-and-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-on-wrist.jpeg" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) worn on one wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcCd5ckDUrYmVrGWSafDMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Same size and weight, but one has more room for information; can you guess which? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At 61g, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 falls on the edge of comfort, thanks to the light nylon strap and reasonably thin titanium case. It also has a 1.9-inch display — squircle-shaped, obviously — which makes reading notifications a breeze. </p><p>Compare that to the 1.5-inch Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which weighs a mere two grams less thanks to its rotating bezel and stainless steel frame. You&apos;d assume that a Galaxy Watch Ultra would have an even <em>larger</em> display to live up to the name, but you&apos;d reach a point where smaller wrists couldn&apos;t bear the weight. </p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung can (A) go painfully heavy with a rotating bezel, (B) go capacitive despite the drawbacks, or (C) take the Apple/Google route with a crown. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro kept its weight down with its capacitive bezel. When I polled my colleagues, however, they collectively insisted that any Ultra watch would need a better solution — either the rotating bezel or a crown. They&apos;d prioritize useability over comfort. </p><p>Samsung allegedly wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">switch to a squircle Galaxy Watch</a> in the future, but Android watch owners see that as the purview of Apple and its imitators; they might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-wants-square-galaxy-watch-again">hate the switch</a> for its look, even if the square screen makes reading and typing easier. Still, I can&apos;t think of another way to get a bigger display without killing our wrists.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-won-apos-t-let-the-ultra-stand-on-its-own-merits-2">Samsung won&apos;t let the Ultra stand on its own merits</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BsndtXaDr4PYZ2Ng7yBg6K" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-and-6-Classic-with-Galaxy-S22.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic, sitting on either side of a Galaxy S22+ phone showing the Galaxy Wearable app, specifically the option to edit app order on a Galaxy Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsndtXaDr4PYZ2Ng7yBg6K.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung likes to make its devices interconnected, the same as Apple. It&apos;s why you need a Samsung phone to check Galaxy Watch ECG readings, or why Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-working-on-supporting-galaxy-ring-on-non-galaxy-phones">"working on"</a> making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> compatible with other non-Galaxy phones.</p><p>That&apos;s probably not going to change with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, even if it <strong>costs</strong> enough to be a standalone device. It&apos;ll probably have built-in cellular data for calling and all the health sensors in the world — maybe even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">blood sugar monitoring</a> — but Samsung will still want you to analyze your data on its phone.</p><p>Naturally, die-hard Samsung fans with disposable income will buy a Galaxy Watch Ultra with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultras</a>, because they want the best possible tech at all times — the same with Apple Watch Ultra 2 buyers. The question is whether Samsung can step outside of that niche, and what kind of value it can offer besides "big battery, big screen." </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE" name="setting-a-timer-rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="Trying to set a timer on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZNohd6QNepvAqkFPZZb5YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the future, AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will be the backbone of wearable tech, giving you a natural way to access information or send replies without being dependent on a tiny screen. However, the rough launches for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/humanes-ai-pin-will-work-with-google-photos-and-contacts">Humane AI pin</a> prove how far off that future is. </p><p>Thankfully, there&apos;s another "AI" option Samsung can take. </p>
<h2 id="samsung-apos-s-ultra-path-ahead-is-health-and-fitness-2">Samsung&apos;s Ultra path ahead is health and fitness</h2>
<p>Aside from Apple nerds, one type of person consistently buys smartwatches in the $500–$1,000 range: athletes, gym rats, and fitness freaks. </p><p>That&apos;s why Apple started going all-out on fitness the year the Ultra came out, focusing on runners, hikers, and cyclists. It targeted people who would normally spend a grand on premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> like the Epix or Fenix. </p><p>Serious athletes won&apos;t settle for any traditional smartwatch because they need weeks of battery life, not days. However, Apple still won over the weekend warrior types who want solid fitness features when they have time but better smarts and apps during the week. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVe5iP465jbv2v3FyU5nb8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-activity.jpeg" alt="A walking activity on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVe5iP465jbv2v3FyU5nb8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve been harping on Samsung&apos;s lack of fitness progress over the last couple of years. To its credit, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro did add offline GPX maps, a popular feature on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>. However, it took them until last year to add heart rate zones, and Samsung still lags behind in areas like GPS accuracy and daily readiness. </p><p>Samsung will take a stride forward for health tracking this summer with the Galaxy Ring, which will give you a daily "Vitality Score" based on your sleep quality. Samsung will call it an "AI" tool, but it&apos;s basically the same algorithm other fitness watch brands have used for the last few years. </p><p>The next step is to incorporate workout data and your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> level to determine how long to recover after a workout or how many active workout minutes you need that day to get fitter safely. It&apos;s the key feature Garmin and Fitbit watches offer, and I&apos;ve no doubt Apple is working on its own version. </p><p>Even if some people only want the Galaxy Watch Ultra to be as RAM-packed, long-lasting, and massive as possible, Samsung can&apos;t escape the fact that plenty of people see watches as a training tool or health tracker, first and foremost. Beyond the Android super-fans, no one will buy an "Ultra" watch that doesn&apos;t go above and beyond for fitness software. </p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung recently started rolling out One UI 6.1 with Galaxy AI features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a> series in South Korea, but the company has apparently paused it due to a  bug.</p><p>A number of Galaxy S22 owners in South Korea have hit a snag with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6.1</a> update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/one_ui_61_update_for_galaxy_s22_series_halted_due_to_a_bug-news-62714.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Apparently, there’s a glitch where the screen turns white and stays that way after unlocking the phone, rendering it unusable.</p><p>Moreover, some Galaxy S22 users took to Samsung&apos;s Korean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s22%EC%8B%9C%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%88-oneui6-1%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EC%A4%91%EB%8B%A8/td-p/26784457" target="_blank">community forums</a> to report that the touchscreen isn’t working on the lock screen after the update. The only fix seems to be a factory reset.</p><p>That said, it looks like owners of older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung flagship models</a> that were slated to receive the update  have nothing to worry about. Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/one-ui-61-testing-on-older-samsung-models">recent update was released for several devices</a> like the Galaxy S21, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Flip 4, and the Z Fold 3 and Flip 3, the rollout has only been paused for the Galaxy S22 series.</p><p>Samsung hasn&apos;t officially recognized the bug yet, but it seems it has pulled the One UI 6.1 firmware back in its home turf. If you haven&apos;t updated your Galaxy S22 yet, you&apos;ll need to hold off for the next firmware release, which should address all the reported issues.</p><p>The bug hasn&apos;t popped up on the other older Galaxy devices yet, so the update is still rolling out for those models.</p><p>The big deal about the latest One UI release is Galaxy AI, which brings a bunch of AI-powered features from the Galaxy S24 to older Samsung flagships. These cool features include Circle to Search with Google, Chat Assist, Live Translate, Note Assist, Browsing Assist, AI-generated wallpapers, and more.</p><p>We&apos;ve reached out to Samsung for clarification and will update this post once we hear back from the company.</p><p>Samsung is probably heading back to square one to fix the bug. Once that&apos;s sorted, it&apos;ll probably restart the update rollout and hopefully extend it to more territories.</p>
