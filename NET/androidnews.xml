<p>Before we dive into our official list, I wanted to start things off by mentioning this deal that slashes $100 off the Sony WH-1000XM4, my personal favorite pair of headphones and one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> on the market today. These cans boast a sleek foldable design, some awesome noise cancelling capabilities, and up to 30 hours of battery life. They're also considerably cheaper than the newer Sony XM5s without skipping out on a lot of features that make those headphones great.   <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-wh1000xm4-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black/6408356.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c45528ed-c107-47a3-b6f6-ac372d3b3833" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$349.99" data-dimension48="$349.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">review from last May</a>, we called the Edge Plus (2023) "the best flagship that Motorola has released in years", and it's not difficult to see why. You're getting a powerful Snapdragon chipset, up to two days of battery life, and an elegant 165Gz pOLED display that could rival any of the best phones on the market. Pick up the unlocked Edge Plus during Best Buy's weekend sale and you'll get a straight $200 off your purchase, plus a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/6540585.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8d94b0b1-63cc-4cd6-89d2-d994a2b0a7a3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Finding a cheap fitness tracker with reliable accuracy and all the key features you need is a challenge. On paper, the Garmin Forerunner 165 looks like a solid option that costs hundreds less than most Garmin watches. So after receiving my review unit, I set out to see how it compares against my two favorite cheap fitness trackers: The COROS PACE 3 and Fitbit Charge 6.</p><p>First, I walked 5,000 steps and ran 1,000 steps wearing all three devices, while counting my steps with a manual pedometer. Then I ran five miles to test their GPS accuracy, while also wearing a Polar H10 chest strap to judge their heart rate accuracy. Lastly, I finished off with a sprint workout on a local track to double-check GPS and heart rate accuracy in more vigorous conditions. </p><p>Here are the results, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-delivers-absurd-value-for-frugal-serious-runners">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> for accuracy!</p>
<h2 id="step-accuracy-2">Step accuracy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-step-test-with-Fitbit-Charge-6-and-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer held in hand with the number 5,000, a Garmin Forerunner 165 (5,062 steps), and a Fitbit Charge 6 (4,812 steps)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTYwcuhJZuMZeNhLmx225M.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I did my original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test">step-tracking accuracy test</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> beat the other brands, with the flagship COROS watch coming in third and the Fitbit Sense coming in last for accuracy. But I wasn&apos;t sure if Garmin&apos;s advantage would persist with a watch model that costs $200 less. </p><p>I wrote down the incidental steps for all three watches outside my front door, then tracked 5,000 steps of walking while counting every step with a pedometer. I then ran another 1,000 steps while counting, to see if the accuracy changed. After that, I stopped tracking each step, but I still wrote down my final step count for each fitness tracker, to see how far apart they were. </p>

<p>Interestingly, my results mirrored my last test: Garmin did exceptionally well at avoiding false-positive steps at just 11 over estimate, compared to 14 last time. COROS over-estimated my count my 84, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a> was 70 steps off. And once again, Fitbit significantly undercounted my steps: 199 off this time, 284 off last time. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK" name="COROS-PACE-3-step-test-with-pedometer.jpeg" alt="A pedometer showing "6,000" and a COROS PACE 3 worn on a wrist with the step count 6,102." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U4MdV6vQFG9cmcSetZ2xGK.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While tracking running, Fitbit and COROS did much better, which makes sense because the accelerometer can detect larger motions more easily. Garmin still won for accuracy, though it did better on average for walking. </p><p>I can&apos;t tell you my actual step count for the day, but I&apos;m inclined to believe that Garmin&apos;s number remained the most accurate. If we assume that, then COROS&apos; count (143 short) is within a reasonable margin of error for such a long distance, whereas Fitbit (794 short) is less forgiveably erroneous. </p>
<h2 id="heart-rate-accuracy-2">Heart rate accuracy</h2>
<p>I wore the Polar H10 chest strap, one of the most popular and respected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-heart-rate-monitor-straps-garmin-fitbit">heart rate monitors</a> out there, to see how the Garmin Forerunner 165 compared to it in accuracy and responsiveness. </p><p>For my first five-mile run, only the Forerunner 165 matched the Polar H10 for average heart rate at 158 bpm, while the Fitbit Charge 6 and COROS PACE 3 came close at 157 bpm. The same goes for minimum heart rate, with Garmin and Polar showing 96 bpm while COROS and Fitbit listed 95 bpm. As for the maximum, both Garmin and COROS registered a max heart rate of 176, while Polar only hit 175 and Fitbit topped at 174. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1964px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ReuSv3N3CKKw3HfU95MCwk" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReuSv3N3CKKw3HfU95MCwk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1964" height="1105" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a five-mile run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The heart rate chart above shows how the Garmin Forerunner 165 and Polar H10 compare directly. As with any wrist-based optical HRM, the Forerunner 165 lags slightly behind the chest strap, climbing at a slower pace and keeping the same heart rate readings after the H10 has already begun to dip back down. </p><p>For the most part, the Forerunner 165 remained within 1–2 bpm of the chest strap at all times, and usually corrected itself fairly quickly. It explains why they ended up with the same average, despite the differences. That said, it did seem to struggle a bit in one context: on hills, it would climb up to the right reading fairly quickly but lag in terms of dropping back down on the downhills. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1964px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="iKUW2tGiZKsgZLShBnKrZk" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-HR-vs-Polar-H10.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Fitbit Charge 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iKUW2tGiZKsgZLShBnKrZk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1964" height="1105" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fitbit Charge 6 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a five-mile run </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the other two comparison charts, it&apos;s difficult to say if COROS or Fitbit are necessarily better or worse. Both brands consistently underreported their heart rates by about 1 bpm, which is annoying. However, they didn&apos;t have quite as much difficulty adjusting to quick heart rate changes. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLhvgmgqRrEA5ebrRxXpAk.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2277" height="1281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a five-mile run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We know Fitbit has Google&apos;s HR algorithm to thank for that, while COROS just did a good job on its own. </p><p>Moving on to the results for my track sprint workout, it&apos;s more difficult to determine accuracy because my Polar H10 had bizarrely deflated results for about 15 seconds early on (as seen in the graph above). So, while the Forerunner 165 and Charge 6 (173 bpm) were higher than the H10 and PACE 3 (172 bpm), I think Garmin and Fitbit might be on point this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Garmin Forerunner 165 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v38Wj6SkfPWNkYCLt37HTj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1880" height="1058" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Forerunner 165 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That part aside, the Forerunner 165 was once again close but always lagging slightly behind the chest strap as I switched from sprints to jogs and back. It averages out well enough in my mind, but if you&apos;re someone fixated on exact specs, you might not be fully satisfied.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3qodW73bBjNuVvZJ2k2Fmj" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and Fitbit Charge 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qodW73bBjNuVvZJ2k2Fmj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1860" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Fitbit Charge 6 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the competing options, the Fitbit Charge 6 impressed me. The chart shows how it reacts almost in lockstep with the Polar H10 to changing heart rate data. It did read slightly low in most cases, but this could be in part because I was wearing it higher up my wrist than normal to make room for the Forerunner 165. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j" name="COROS-PACE-3-HR-vs-Polar-H10-second-test.jpeg" alt="Heart rate chart comparing the Polar H10 strap and COROS PACE 3 watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBvb6rEzZHBWSSjU4XX49j.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1865" height="1049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The COROS PACE 3 vs. the Polar H10 for HR accuracy across a one-mile track run. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The PACE 3 did adequately enough, but had more issues than the Forerunner 165 with lagging data. There are a few major discrepancies where it rose higher than it should have, or failed to rise at all. That said, it did hit a very reasonable average HR, so I wouldn&apos;t be too disappointed with the results. </p>
<h2 id="gps-accuracy-2">GPS accuracy</h2>
<p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 doesn&apos;t have the dual-frequency GPS tracking of the more expensive Forerunners, but it does have an "All-Systems mode" that pulls from GPS and another satellite system like GLONASS or GALILEO simultaneously for better results. Meanwhile, the COROS PACE 3 does have top-tier dual-band tracking, while the Fitbit Charge 6 only uses GPS or GLONASS individually, with some help from your smartphone GPS if you use "Dynamic GPS" mode. </p><p>Also, COROS and Garmin gave their respective running watches an altimeter to judge elevation, something the Fitbit Charge 6 lacks — so it estimates based on GPS data. </p>

<p>Garmin and COROS were relatively close to one another, while Fitbit&apos;s GPS-only results seemed to overestimate how far I&apos;d run and my pace as a result. That <em>especially</em> applies to my elevation gain: My route had hills, but Fitbit&apos;s estimate really exaggerated how high they were. </p><p>Looking at the actual GPS satellite map, the Fitbit Charge 6 was predictably inaccurate, straying wildly off the path. So, I focused instead on the two watches that I could actually count upon to be reasonably accurate: the Forerunner 165 and COROS PACE 3. In the screenshots below, Garmin&apos;s path is pink, while COROS&apos; route is orange. </p>

<p>In each case, Garmin "won" the accuracy battle. I generally stayed on the right side of the path in both directions. In Garmin&apos;s measurement, it showed me closer to the middle in both directions, while COROS consistently showed me running in the grass and dirt alongside the path. </p><p>Does this matter? Given the similar overall distance, it&apos;s hard to say. If GPS inaccuracy of any kind frustrates you, you&apos;ll want to look at a more expensive, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">higher-end Garmin watch</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-255-review">Forerunner 255</a> or higher. I&apos;m personally satisfied that these results are trustworthy compared to GPS-only watches. </p>

<p>Turning to my track workout, I ran my four laps entirely in the third lane so I could compare the watches&apos; fidelity in satellite view. Garmin, COROS, and Fitbit have pink, orange, and blue lines, respectively. </p><p>With the Garmin Forerunner 165, the watch would show me in the second or third lane on curves and the beginning of straightaways, then drift closer to the inner lanes over time. I suspect this was the watch filling in gaps in coverage, pulling my actual location to the left because I would eventually turn left. The tracked distance was exactly right at 1,660 meters, but that&apos;s probably because I marked myself as in the third lane in the pre-activity settings. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-fitbit-charge-6-coros-pace-3-gps-track-test-2.jpeg" alt="A satellite map of a track, showing the author's location while wearing the COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Garmin Forerunner 165." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W7QrcqZzJa2BDeCCoaXJn7.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2406" height="1353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>COROS&apos; track results mirrored what I noted in my original PACE 3 review: They&apos;re not as accurate as expected. My GPS map showed me way off in the right-side lanes for most of the run and cutting across the inner track on one of the turns. Even though its 1,658-meter result was accurate, that&apos;s (again) because COROS has a Track Run activity that lets you set a lane. </p><p>On the other hand, at least the PACE 3 and Forerunner 165 were <em>consistent</em> in their slight inaccuracies. The Fitbit Charge 6 wavered wildly across lanes as if I was purposefully doing sidesteps (or slightly drunk). The distance (1,625 meters) was more noticeably off, even after I forgot to turn it off and walked off the track to cool down. The GPS-only tracking and the lack of a Track Run activity mode hurt Fitbit&apos;s ability to compete, here. </p>

Garmin and COROS do support HRV data for stress and recovery, but only the Charge 6 measures AFib both actively and passively, along with skin temperature. It&apos;s the lightest and cheapest watch of the three — though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-premium-worth-annual-subscription">Fitbit Premium</a> will close the gap after the 6-month free trial and one annual subscription — and has a few Google app perks you&apos;ll appreciate, like Maps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Wallet</a>.</p><p>The COROS PACE 3 has a fantastic 24-day battery life, 38-hour GPS, and 15-hour dual-frequency GPS, crushing the 7-day Charge 6 and the 11-day Forerunner 165. The trade-off is its dull MIP display, which makes it less enjoyable to look at in non-fitness contexts. What matters more for runners is that it gets the full extent of COROS&apos; training analysis, like Training Load and Status, while the Forerunner 165 is artificially restricted from certain metrics to upsell you to the 265. </p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 won for step and GPS location accuracy, despite not having the most accurate satellite tech that Garmin offers. It also held its own for HR accuracy, even if it could have been better. I simply wish that Garmin had given the Forerunner 165 the Training Load metric. I can make do without Training Status or Readiness, but it&apos;s hard not knowing whether you&apos;re staying consistent on activity level compared to past weeks.</p><p>Overall, I&apos;m really happy with the results for my three favorite fitness trackers, and feel comfortable recommending the Forerunner 165 if you can make do without the upgrades that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> or 265 offers.  </p>

<ul><li>Reddit has introduced a new ad format, dubbed free-form ads, designed to look similar to regular user posts.</li><li>Free-form ads incorporate various formats, such as images, videos, and text, within a single post using templates.</li><li>Early data shows promising results, with free-form ads garnering 28% more clicks and increased engagement compared to other ad formats.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reddit has launched a fresh ad format that&apos;s crafted to blend right in with regular user posts.</p><p>The new ad style, known as free-form ads, lets advertisers engage with users just like regular posts, aiming to get the most interaction possible. These ads allow advertisers to mix it up with different formats in one post, like images, videos, and text, thanks to handy templates.</p><p>Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/advertise-like-a-redditor-with-our-all-new-completely-unique-ad-format-free-form-ads" target="_blank">mentions</a> that the ad format is inspired by one of the platform&apos;s favorite post types: megathreads. These megatrends act as hubs for discussions on hot topics, making them a go-to spot for users.</p><p>According to the company, this new format could be perfect for things like product launches or getting a brand in front of a fresh audience. Like other ads on Reddit, users can tell the difference between free-form ads and regular posts because they&apos;ll have a "Promoted" label next to the company&apos;s name, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/reddit-introduces-a-new-ad-format-that-looks-similar-to-posts-made-by-users/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/reddit-updates-feed-search-2023">Reddit</a> mentioned that these new ads are its most native format yet, made to look similar to community content shared by users. Reddit is hoping you won&apos;t even notice it&apos;s an ad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.55%;"><img id="7zUDhvPiXmrm42ksxiB3fQ" name="Reddit-Clicking-Through-Templates.gif" alt="Reddit's  new ad format" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zUDhvPiXmrm42ksxiB3fQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2200" height="1332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reddit clarified that the open-ended design of these ads will grant advertisers more room to get creative and spark conversations with Redditors. However, while the new format might appeal to advertisers, ads that resemble regular posts might not be well-received by users.</p><p>Despite concerns, early results indicate that the initiative is paying off. According to Reddit&apos;s data, free-form ads received 28% more clicks than other ad formats on the site and witnessed an increase in engagement.</p><p>The new ad format is now available to all advertisers on Reddit worldwide through the Reddit Ads Manager.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Depending on how much of a phone nerd you are, you may never have even thought about what Google Play Services actually is. You could be forgiven for dismissing it as a dry and technical part of Android, but in reality, it&apos;s a crucially important part of the way the OS works. Essentially, it&apos;s what puts the <em>Google</em> into Android, influencing everything from security to Google integration with the apps you use every day.</p>
<p>Google Play Services was announced in 2014 as a way to introduce new features to Android phones in a way that didn&apos;t require a firmware update. That&apos;s because back in 2014, before the days of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-security-updates-progress" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-11-security-updates-progress">monthly security patches</a>, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> were often left waiting months for crucial fixes. And forcing users to wait for a full firmware update to protect against malicious apps or tweak the way Google features worked was less than ideal.</p>
<p>So there are benefits for everyone. Developers get important APIs that work across the vast majority of the active Android user base. (At the time of writing, every device since 5.0 Lollipop supports the "current" Google Play Services version.) Users, in turn, benefit from this through new features and security fixes, even if they&apos;re not running the latest OS version. And for Google, Play Services acts as insurance against the rise of "forked" Android, as we&apos;ve seen through the difficulties faced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fcc-huawei-zte-communications-usa-ban">Huawei when it was blacklisted</a> a few years ago.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-than-just-an-app"><span>More than just an app</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kYLd8oCULjmdAuCAfdcVDN" name="Google-Play-Services-hero.jpeg" alt="Close-up of Google Play Services app info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kYLd8oCULjmdAuCAfdcVDN.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Alex Dobie / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Services</a> is essentially just an app, controlled by Google, which updates automatically in the background on every Google-certified Android phone. There&apos;s not really any user-facing part of the app unless you count the "Google Settings" part of the Settings app. But Play Services&apos; various tendrils are spread throughout Android, especially in newer versions of the OS.</p>
<p>As a system-level "app," Play Services can run with elevated permissions and supersede anything and everything in the OS if it needs to. Google has expanded Play Services&apos; capabilities extensively since it was introduced way back in 2014, and the company can easily modify it to do even more in the future.</p>
<p>To put it simply: if an Android app interacts with a Google service, chances are it&apos;s doing so through Google Play Services.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>For apps, Play Services acts as a gateway to Google services on your phone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Google Play Services client library gives developers APIs to make apps work with Google services on devices with the Play Services app installed. This includes Cloud Messaging, Drive, Location, Play Games, Wear OS and Google Pay, to name just a few. And because the Play Services app updates automatically in the background and works on all versions of Android going back to Lollipop, Google can roll out changes, improvements, and new features in Android&apos;s integration with these services without a firmware update. That means the carriers and device manufacturers aren&apos;t in the loop at all, so Google is in complete control of the rollout.</p>
<p>While the Android firmware update situation has improved considerably since Play Services launched in 2014, a Play Services update can still be pushed out much, much quicker than a traditional over-the-air update. As a result, Play Services lets Google move at pace when introducing new features and services for Android.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fw9XbY2Htg5MdJd684tKD6" name="NHS COVID-19 app lifestyle.jpg" alt="NHS COVID-19 app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fw9XbY2Htg5MdJd684tKD6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A great example of this is the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System, developed in cooperation with Apple. On the Android side, the ENS was added in the background as a Play Services update to every Android phone running firmware from 2014 or later. And when a glitch with the system occurred earlier in 2021, Google could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nhs-covid-19-app-showing-permanent-loading-notification-youre-not-alone" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/NHS-covid-19-app-showing-permanent-loading-notification-youre-not-alone">fix it almost immediately</a> across the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Without Google Play Services, rolling out anything like the COVID-19 ENS would likely have required herculean effort from manufacturers and carriers to develop and certify updated firmware for every Android phone in the world.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google couldn't have built its Exposure Notification System without Play Services.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also good for developers and users for many other reasons, most of which are pretty obvious once you think about it. Rather than devs having to worry about targeting each of these Google features differently across OS versions, the heavy lifting is done by Play Services. What&apos;s more, users aren&apos;t left in the lurch if they&apos;re not running the latest version of Android. (And even in 2024, there are still a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> of users not running the latest version of Android.)</p>
<p>Through Play Services, many things thought to be Android features — like Google location services or Google Play Games — have been decoupled from the core OS. That&apos;s another reason why directly comparing iOS and Android version distribution doesn&apos;t tell the whole story. A very significant part of the Google Android experience is kept up-to-date, automatically, in the background.</p>
<p>Google has continued this push towards more modularity in Android in the years since Play Services first arrived. Most notably in Android 10, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/project-mainline" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/project-mainline">"Project Mainline,"</a> a.k.a. Google Play System Updates, allowed parts of the OS itself, like Wi-Fi, tethering, and neural networking components, to be updated by Google without requiring a full firmware update. In Android 12, Google expanded Mainline to include the Android runtime itself, the part that runs your apps. That of all makes Android much more secure, even if your phone isn&apos;t running the latest platform update.</p>
<p>It&apos;s true that some changes, fixes, and improvements still require a firmware update. But in today&apos;s Android ecosystem, there&apos;s a ton of really important stuff that no longer does.</p>

<p>Google Play Services also has an enormous role to play in securing older Android phones against bad apps, which generally come from app stores other than the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>The main weapon in Google&apos;s arsenal is Google Play Protect, which is effectively Android&apos;s built-in virus scanner. When you&apos;re installing an app from a third-party location, it&apos;s scanned by this constantly updated feature to identify malicious tendencies, and Play Protect will also periodically scan your phone in the background. This is a big part of why scary-sounding Android security bugs like 2015&apos;s "Fake ID" never end up taking off. Thanks to Play Services, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-android-security-fearmongering-bs" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-android-security-fearmongering-bs">the vast majority of Android devices are protected</a>, and offending apps are nipped in the bud almost immediately.</p>
<p>You could say this is a stopgap solution, since the underlying vulnerability isn&apos;t fixed until a firmware update or Project Mainline update is rolled out. But either way, the malware&apos;s not getting through, and users are protected — even if they&apos;re running an older Android security patch level.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vhsuMTfoorASBEjLJ2T66U" name="Android Bugdroid statue lifestyle.jpg" alt="Android Bugdroid statue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vhsuMTfoorASBEjLJ2T66U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Play Services is packed with proprietary Google stuff, and as such, isn&apos;t included in the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP). Like other Google apps, it&apos;s closed-source. Any "fork" of open-source Android — a version built off AOSP without Google&apos;s involvement — is on its own in terms of having to recreate what Play Services provides.</p>
<p>Nothing is stopping a manufacturer wanting to build an Android device without getting GMS (Google Mobile Services) approval from building their own service layer instead of Play Services. For example, Huawei has done exactly that with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-finalizing-google-services-replacements-year-end-launch-sight" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-finalizing-google-services-replacements-year-end-launch-sight">Huawei Mobile Services</a> layer. But such an endeavor represents a huge technical challenge, so for most manufacturers who aren&apos;t legally compelled to <em>not</em> work with Google, it&apos;s easier to just license Play Services along with the rest of GMS.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android may be open source, but Play Services definitely isn't.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Just as Play Services is a solution to some of Android&apos;s inherent weaknesses — the slow pace of firmware updates due to the number of moving parts involved, and the app development and security implications of this — the lack of Play Services in Android forks creates significant engineering work for anyone serious about taking Android away from Google. In effect, it&apos;s an insurance policy that guarantees Google long-term control of Android — at least everywhere outside of mainland China.</p>
<p>That&apos;s not to say this is necessarily part of any diabolical Google master plan, yet this is the situation that exists. An operating system like Android can only gobble up market share with the help of device (and carrier) diversity. Diversity inevitably leads to fragmentation, and to combat that, you need a service and security layer that exists outside the OS.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the challenge that any convincing fork of Android needs to solve, and it&apos;s not an easy one. In the meantime, those in the Google Android world have Play Services to thank for enabling the platform&apos;s growth and helping keep phones secure.</p>

<p>It&apos;s nice being able to pick and choose what phone I want to use on a daily basis. Usually, whenever I get a new phone, that becomes the "standard" for a while. That was the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> until the Galaxy S24 Ultra arrived, giving me a reason to go back to a "slab" phone.</p><p>Leading up to that point, I had already gotten a little bored of the Open, but not because of the phone itself. That&apos;s just the nature of the beast when it comes to someone who plays around with new phones and technology for a living. Boredom is probably the best way to describe it. So, honestly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> arrived at the perfect time.</p><p>Fast forward to now, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra lasted a little less than two months before I decided that enough was enough and that slab phones no longer interested me.</p><p>For a little bit of context, I have been using the OnePlus Open in tandem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> ever since it was announced. That&apos;s a little over three months, squeaking past the two-and-a-half months I spent with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-back-titanium-04.jpg" alt="The back of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in the Titanium Grey colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7P2ErZCEHSc73umEzHChMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few years, I&apos;ve learned that the majority of the time spent using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> is from the cover screen. So why would I want to go back to a foldable phone when the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s display is way better than that of the OnePlus Open or Z Fold 5? Well, it&apos;s a simple and obvious answer — it doubles as a pocketable tablet.</p><p>This has been the thing that keeps drawing me back to foldable phones, even as I&apos;ve grown tired of Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-z-fold-5-doesnt-change-much-over-the-z-fold-4">refusing to upgrade</a> anything but the processor on the Z Fold lineup. I can go from scrolling Reddit or logging the latest poopy diaper on the outer screen to trying to get some work done in just moments. </p><p>Not to mention the multitasking capabilities of having multiple app windows open at the same time without feeling overly cramped. This is somewhat of a testament to OnePlus&apos; unique Open Canvas feature, letting you use three apps in full-screen and switching between them. But, it&apos;s also still quite nice being able to just open more than just two apps and actually use them. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="daj4UqvkxFQCW2oR3iFipG" name="oneplus-open-24.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/daj4UqvkxFQCW2oR3iFipG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the OnePlus Open kind of saved me, it&apos;s not without flaws of its own. OxygenOS continues to be janky from time to time, such as the taskbar getting in the way of me tapping into the text field within Telegram. Not to mention that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-open-android-14-oxygenos-update-united-states">Android 14 for the Open</a> <em>just</em> arrived here in the U.S. after only being available in India for some time. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S24 Ultra launched with Android 14 out of the box, and the Galaxy Z Fold 5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/galaxy-z-fold-5-flip-5-stable-one-ui-6-android-14-update">received its update</a> in November of last year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's still too much jankiness in OxygenOS on the OnePlus Open.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to know that outside of the foldable form factor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is a better phone in pretty much every way. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">cameras alone</a> are enough of a reason why this is the case, not to mention the new and improved display that looks so darn impressive.</p><p>I don&apos;t even have a ton of complaints when it comes to One UI, although a few things are missing that I still don&apos;t understand. One such example is that there&apos;s no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-conversation-widgets-android-12">Conversation Widget</a> available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, despite being made available when Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>. Surprisingly, it&apos;s there on the OnePlus Open, and I&apos;ve been grateful for that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>But it doesn't fold.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>After coming home from the hospital with a newborn in tow, I quickly realized how cumbersome and awkward it was to play finger gymnastics with only one free hand. Yes, I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">MagSafe case</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-popsockets">PopSocket</a> on the S24 Ultra, but that doesn&apos;t quite solve the problem in most instances. So, I decided to give the OnePlus Open another shake, and while it&apos;s almost the same size, the differences are such that it&apos;s simply more comfortable to use.</p><p>While the Open is definitely a hefty device to use while closed, it&apos;s a half-inch smaller than the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That makes one-handed use much easier, as I don&apos;t have to try and strain my fingers trying to reach one of the corners. Which is quite important when the little one wants to take a nap on your chest. Most of the time, I just have to give up doing what I was trying to do on the S24 Ultra until I can use my other hand.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve even been thinking about giving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> another go, as the narrow cover screen, which I like to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-im-skipping-galaxy-z-fold-5">complain</a> about, is practically perfect. At this point, I might just go back to the Fold 5 to see whether much has changed. I know it really hasn&apos;t, but in my head, there&apos;s a chance that I might fall back in love with the Fold 5.</p><p>I&apos;m also in this weird space of wanting to pay super-close attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> rumor mill. This might finally be the year that Samsung revamps the hardware, giving us proper cameras and an inner display crease that doesn&apos;t do its best Grand Canyon impersonation. At this point, I couldn&apos;t even tell you what the rumors are suggesting. It&apos;s been a practice of tempering my expectations, which is quite a difficult task for me.</p>

<p>There&apos;s really nothing wrong with the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy, at least if you&apos;re in North America and don&apos;t want a foldable. Even with the camera "side-grades" and the exorbitant price tag, you&apos;d have a tough time finding a more complete package.</p><p>While we might not have as many options as those living abroad, I&apos;m still thankful that there are at least some options to choose from. And before we know it, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be here, potentially complicating my decision. For now, I&apos;ll be sticking with the OnePlus Open and maybe giving the Z Fold 5 another chance.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-xa0-2">What you need to know </h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 is expected to introduce a Powered Off Finder API.</li><li>This API will enable compatible devices to be tracked even when switched off.</li><li>The feature is expected to be available on the Google Pixel 9 series, and the Pixel 8 series.</li></ul>
<p>Google has been hard at work on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">Find My Device network</a> but has not yet made the system widely available to users. However, recent reports suggest that a Powered Off Finder API will be a standout feature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> when it rolls out, most likely in the second half of 2024.</p><p>As reported by Android Police, the feature will allow compatible phones to be located even when they are switched off. The system works by allowing the handset to broadcast Bluetooth beacons to other Android devices that are part of the Find My Device network. The receiving devices will then encrypt and upload the device&apos;s location, transmitting the beacon to Google’s server and allowing the device&apos;s owner to see where it is.</p>
<p>According to the report, this feature will only work on devices with specific hardware support that allows them to power the Bluetooth controller even when the phone is shut down. For that reason, it will not work on all Android devices.</p><p>It’s expected that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> series will be the first compatible handset to benefit from this feature. But interestingly, it also appears that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will also be able to support the API, as well as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a>. Older devices, including the Pixel 7 series and the Pixel Fold, don’t appear to have the necessary software support to operate Powered Off Finding.</p>

<p>This would make sense; back in April 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-find-my-device-phone-off-rumor">we reported</a> that Google was working on a Find My Device feature. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unknown-tracker-alerts-roll-out">Google even announced</a> the feature at I/O 2023, stating it would arrive “later this summer.” At that point, it was believed that the feature was being designed to work with the Pixel 8 when it launched later that year.</p><p>The release of Powered Off Finding was subsequently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-version-3-update">pushed back</a> while Google and Apple collaborated to solve the problem of unwanted location tracking. While Google offers unknown tracker alerts that can detect Bluetooth trackers, including AirTags, an equivalent does not currently exist on iOS. At the moment, Apple devices can detect AirTags but cannot detect trackers that aren’t connected to Apple’s Find My network.  </p><p>Google and Apple have been working together since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-apple-partner-tackle-unwanted-location-tracking">May 2023</a> to create a joint specification based on Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers (DULT). The hope is that Android devices will soon start to benefit from this feature. </p>

<p>While the Google Pixel 7a is a (slightly) older-model phone, introduced in May 2023, it’s still a great one worth considering if you love the Google Pixel line. It’s one of the more affordable options that still provides tons of great features and impressive specs. Plus, the cameras are fabulous and the photo editing features are second to none.</p></p>

<p>Shopping around for a new phone? Maybe you’re looking for a budget phone for yourself or as a teen’s first device. Perhaps it’s something simple your elderly parents or grandparents can enjoy. It might even be a secondary phone to use alongside your business phone.</p><p>Whatever the case, you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars for a decent phone. And when it comes to the Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a, the battle of the “A” phones proves they both get an A+ for a balance of price and performance. But let’s dive deeper to see how they stack up against one another.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-the-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: The looks and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oh8cFrV39EygQspZmGTLsL" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-01.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh8cFrV39EygQspZmGTLsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone (2a) comes in black or white with a unique Glyph interface that consists of LED lights on the back that light up to advise of notifications, timers, volume adjustments, music playback, and more. It’s a design Nothing has employed since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Nothing Phone (1)</a>, but it’s still delightful to see.</p><p>It’s equipped with a 6.7-inch 2412 x 1080 AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and a polycarbonate chassis with aluminum side rails coated in polycarbonate resin. The always-on screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, so it isn’t quite as rugged as some of the more expensive phones on the market. Given that you’ll want to show off the design without sacrificing protection, finding the perfect transparent Nothing Phone (2a) case is crucial anyway. Peak brightness is 1,300 nits, so don’t expect this phone to be as bright and beautiful as other more premium models either.</p><p>You can customize the look by using things like a monochromatic theme, branded themes and icons, and even removing app labels so the phone looks as you want it to. There are plenty of Nothing OS widgets from which to choose as well, so you can truly make the phone experience personalized to you.</p><p>The phone is only IP54 rated, so you get mild resistance to dust and water. But you’ll want to proceed with caution if you’re using it by the pool or on the beach, and you won’t want to accidentally drop this phone in the toilet. A spray of water, however, will be fine. </p><p>The 5,000mAh battery will purportedly give you up to two days’ worth of use per charge, and the phone also supports 45W fast charging that will give you another day after just 20 minutes. However, it does not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-android-phones-can-handle-wireless-charging">support wireless charging</a>. For those who are constantly on the go, this could be what sways you in favor of this device; while those who rely on wireless charging should note that this phone means you have to forego that luxury.</p><p>There’s no expandable storage but you get either 128GB or 256GB onboard. Other inclusions are USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers. Plus, the phone has a 360° antenna which Nothing says can ensure a reliable connection.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumctseS6a9Jwts5D3o7XF" name="google pixel 7a lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumctseS6a9Jwts5D3o7XF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll get a wider selection of colors with the Google Pixel 7a, which comes in Sea, Charcoal, or Snow, along with the Google-exclusive Coral finish. It has a much smaller 6.1-inch always-on OLED screen that boasts an almost identical 2400 x 1080 resolution. While the high brightness mode taps out at about 1,000 nits, <em>Android Central</em>’s Nicholas Sutrich says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">in his review</a> that he had no issues seeing the display outdoors in bright sunlight, or in the dark.</p><p>The screen is reinforced with Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a step down from the Nothing (2a), but it’s still scratch-resistant and has a fingerprint-resistant coating. This is combined with the 3D thermoformed composite back with a tactile alloy frame and visor. Nonetheless, you’re still advised to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-7a-cases">protective case for the phone</a>. Sutrich reports that the phone itself is slippery and the back tends to attract a lot of dust and fingerprints.</p><p>The refresh rate is a step down as well at just 90Hz, though Sutrich didn’t encounter any issues with responsiveness and productivity while reviewing the phone. It is slightly more rugged with an IP67 rating, however, which means an accidental dunk in the toilet or pool isn’t as big a worry with this phone as it would be with the Nothing Phone (2a).</p><p>The battery is smaller in the Google Pixel 7a as well at just 4,385mAh, rated to last a day and beyond. There is an Extreme Battery Saver mode to extend battery life to up to 72 hours in a pinch, and this phone supports both fast and wireless charging.</p><p>The Google Pixel 7a only comes in a 128GB variant, and without a memory card slot, this means you’re limited in what you can store unless you invest in cloud storage as well. This phone also offers the usuals, like USB-C, Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, 5G connectivity, stereo speakers, fingerprint unlock, and more.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> compare head-to-head when examining specs alone.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are some notable differences when it comes down to specs with these two phones. But let&apos;s dive deeper into processing, power, and cameras.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-power-processing-and-more-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: Power, processing, and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-red-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) with the stock glass red wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s what’s inside that counts, as the saying goes, so it’s important to know how these two phones differ on the insides as well. </p><p>The Nothing Phone (2a) runs on the Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro octa-core processor, which will work well for everyday activities, including apps and games.</p><p>Speaking of the latter, the phone also has an advanced cooling system and an extra-large vapor chamber that affords more even heat distribution. A large cooling area, meanwhile, has a thick graphite layer for rapid heat dissipation, so bandwidth-intensive tasks like graphic-heavy games should run wonderfully on this phone. Sutrich did an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">early first impressions review</a> of this phone as well and he said he had no problems playing any of the games he tried on the device.</p><p>It has 8GB RAM as a standard for the 128GB version, or you can upgrade to a variant with 256GB storage that increases this to 128GB. There’s also a RAM booster feature that can leverage free storage to be used as more memory, so the phone runs more efficiently.</p><p>Out of the box with Android 14, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-gets-its-first-update">Nothing Phone (2a) supports three years of major Android updates</a> and four years of security updates, so you can be confident that it will last for a long time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB" name="Google-Pixel-7a-display-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's vibrant, bright display showcasing the home screen with the default coral feathers wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHqTnwm9mbE55iEUKUgEdB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 7a is powered by the Google Tensor G2 processor, which has since been replaced by the Tensor G3, though it’s still quite powerful. Sutrich tried playing various games during his review period and didn’t run into any issues. While the phone taps out at 8GB RAM, that’s still decent to keep up with most everyday needs.</p><p>Since the phone is over a year old, it runs on Android 13, but you can upgrade to Android 14. Google supports up to three years of Android platform updates, five years of security updates, and various Google Feature Drops. So, while you’ll only get two more updates in the cycle when it comes to the OS, the Feature Drops means the phone will remain current at least through to 2026. By that time, you’ll probably be ripe for an upgrade anyway.</p><p>While the Google Pixel 7a doesn’t have all the cool AI features you’ll get with the step-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a>, you can still access some of the most beloved features like call assist, clear calling, real-time language translations, and more. And, of course, seamless operation with a wealth of Google apps and services.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-02.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone (2a) with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtcvrD2k44KFgDydnRfA3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of us use our smartphones as our primary cameras nowadays, so this is an important factor to consider as well.</p><p>The Nothing Phone (2a) has a 50MP dual main camera, including an ultra-wide lens with a 114° field-of-view. This combines with a 32MP wide-angle front camera, which is a much higher resolution than the selfie camera on the Google Pixel 7a.</p><p>There’s nothing to write home about when it comes to the cameras, but you’ll be able to take decent shots with optical image stabilization, LED flash, and HDR. You can also shoot video at up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second. Some other notable camera features include a TrueLens engine that powers things like night mode, motion capture, and portrait optimizer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N" name="Google-Pixel-7a-on-side-camera-bar.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 7a's metal camera bar up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7AAXjyzjpLpGQm8m5jD9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 7a really shines when it comes to the camera. You get cool photo-taking and editing features like Photo Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, Super Res Zoom, Frequent Faces, dual exposure control, Magic Eraser, Real Tone, and Face Unblur.</p><p>The main camera is higher resolution at 64MP Quad PD but you only get an 80° FOV, so you won’t be able to get as much in a shot as you would with the Nothing Phone (2a) camera. If you travel and love landscape photos, or tend to take a lot of group selfies, this is something to consider.</p><p>The ultra-wide camera is much lower resolution than the Nothing Phone (2a) at just 13MP, but it has a 120° FOV, so you can get wider pics, but not at as high a resolution. The selfie camera is also 13MP with a 95° FOV, so selfies shouldn’t be an issue, even with multiple people or with a background you want to capture on either side of the shot. But the resolution is much lower here, too.</p><p>Despite the numbers suggesting the Google Pixel 7a has a sub-par camera, however, consider that in his experience, Sutrich says the photos he captured surpassed his expectations, both in terms of quality and how quickly they could be snapped after tapping the shutter. He did have some issues with zoom detail and white balance. Based on my own observations as well, the Google Pixel 7a takes wonderful photos with crisp detail and bright colors. All the post-capture editing features also make it a cut above, and they work beautifully. Overall, the cameras are surprisingly better than the specs might suggest.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-google-pixel-7a-which-should-you-buy-2">Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v5JDdQG9KwMfZn2HqcUeRL" name="nothing-phone-2a-side-angle.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone (2a) side rails" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5JDdQG9KwMfZn2HqcUeRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the big question: which phone should you buy between the Nothing Phone (2a) vs. Google Pixel 7a? They come in at around the same price, with the Nothing Phone (2a) having the edge. You can get the version with twice the storage and more RAM for less than the price of the 8GB/128GB version of the Pixel 7a.</p><p>The Nothing (2a) is superior to the Google Pixel 7a in many respects, including some of the most important specs. It’s also the newer of the two phones. Since Google hasn’t yet released an “a” version of the popular Google Pixel 8, the 7a is the most affordable current model you can buy in the line.</p><p>Neither are ultra-rugged and durable, so you’ll need a protective case out of the gate (which you should get for even rugged, waterproof phones). The Nothing Phone (2a) has a slightly stronger screen but the Google Pixel 7a offers better water and dust-resistance. The Nothing Phone (2a) offers a bigger battery with better-rated battery life. But it comes down to splitting hairs when most of us charge our phones daily anyway.</p><p>Based on specs alone, the Nothing Phone (2a) has better cameras as well, but there aren’t any fancy photo editing features like you’ll get with the Google Pixel 7a. If you tend to take photos you always need to fix in some fashion, you’ll love having the option to do it right from the camera app on the Pixel 7a, and in ways you never thought possible (think turning a blurry photo crisp or removing distracting elements from the background of a photo).</p><p>You get an arguably better processor with the Google Pixel 7a but less RAM, as noted, and a lower screen refresh rate. Still, Sutrich had nothing negative to say in this department about this phone, so the Google Pixel 7a will likely be able to keep up with your day, and then some.</p><p>Bottom line: as far as budget phones go, you can’t go wrong with either of these devices. If you want the most for your money, however, go with the Nothing Phone (2a). It’s the newer model of the two, boasts impressive specs, and it’ll have all your friends asking you about your funky-looking phone. If you value better water resistance, wireless charging, the Google ecosystem and processor, and want a smaller device, the Google Pixel 7a is a good choice and will be for a few years to come.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest WhatsApp beta versions reveal interesting features coming to the messaging service.</li><li>The messaging app could allow users to pin up to five chats instead of one.</li><li>Similarly, users can pin up to three messages in a single conversation — an up from only one.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is found testing new handy features in its latest beta versions on Android phones. These include the new ability to pin more chats and messages within the chat.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android bearing the <strong>2.24.6.13</strong> version, which is available through the Google Play Store, allows users to pin more than three chats on the messaging platform. This comes as a follow-up to pin channels in the updates tab from the previous beta version (<strong>2.24.4.3</strong>), notes WABetaInfo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="iSgWhbNLBQDaDaiN6Ru5Pg" name="WhatsApp-Chat-pinning-feature.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Chat Pinning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iSgWhbNLBQDaDaiN6Ru5Pg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, the Meta-owned messaging platform only allowed users to pin up to three chats. However, the shared screenshots of the beta version indicate up to five chats, which are pinned on the Chats tab. The new feature is believed to help users prioritize their chats or groups they frequently interact with. It is still unclear whether the feature allows more than five chats to be pinned, as WABetaInfo shares that they could pin up to five chats.</p><p>On the other hand, WABetaInfo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-6-15-whats-new/">also shared</a> another interesting feature that appeared in another WhatsApp beta for the Android <strong>2.24.6.15</strong> version. It allows users to pin more than one message in an individual chat. </p><p>The new beta update indicates that users can pin up to three messages in a conversation. And, when users try to pin a fourth message, the oldest pinned message is believed to be removed from the pinned list, and the new one gets added, notes WABetaInfo. Previously, WhatsApp users had to unpin the first pinned message to replace it with a new one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="Jdjb2BvKSRcoDJepCwP9Zg" name="WhatsApp-message-pinning-feature.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Message Pinning" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jdjb2BvKSRcoDJepCwP9Zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Users who wish to save essential messages from individual chats can now pin three messages per chat instead of one, which is a convenient addition. The limit could possibly increase based on user behavior and feedback from the beta testing.</p><p>As mentioned, both features are currently active in the aforementioned beta versions of the WhatsApp app. Users will have to wait for the official rollout, which is likely to commence soon. Meanwhile, users can still test the feature by enrolling in the beta version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging platform</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Apple has reportedly scooped up another startup, and this time it&apos;s Ontario-based DarwinAI, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/apple-aapl-buys-canadian-ai-startup-darwinai-as-part-of-race-to-add-features" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, Apple is a bit late to the generative AI race, what with ChatGPT and rivals from Microsoft and Google already dominating the market. But now that Apple is apparently jumping into the scene, it might mean the competition for on-device AI dominance is getting intense, especially with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google dropping its Gemini Nano model not too long ago</a>.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, Apple snagged DarwinAI earlier this year. The Canadian startup specializes in AI for visually checking out manufacturing components. Plus, it has built technology to make AI systems smaller and faster.</p><p>There&apos;s still no official word from the tech giant, and Apple did not immediately return Android Central&apos;s request for comment.</p><p>That said, all signs point to it. Apple has already brought on board loads of DarwinAI&apos;s team, including co-founder Alexander Wong. The startup has also shut down its social media accounts and website. And if you check Wong&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wong-90650216/details/experience/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>, he&apos;s been with Apple since January 2024, leading machine learning research.</p><p>Tim Cook revealed during Apple&apos;s earnings call in February that the company was planning to roll out generative AI-powered features "later this year." This acquisition could be the first big hint that Apple is preparing to inject on-device AI features into its upcoming products.</p><p>As of this time, Apple&apos;s AI use in current products is kind of restricted to the Apple Vision Pro and a bunch of AI-powered functionalities in iOS 17.</p><p>But the million-dollar question is: what will Apple do with DarwinAI? It&apos;s been keeping mum about its AI agenda. Considering DarwinAI&apos;s knack for making AI systems smaller and speedier, a smart bet would be on Apple&apos;s tech beefing up AI features in iOS 18.</p><p>Last year, when Google brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, it seemed like a direct jab at Apple&apos;s core business. But Apple hasn&apos;t really hinted at doing something similar with iOS and Siri this year.</p><p>Apple needs to hustle in the generative AI game, as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft are all charging ahead with their own services.</p>
