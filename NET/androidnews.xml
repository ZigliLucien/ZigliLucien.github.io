                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have over two dozen mechanical keyboards, and my daily driver is an Angry Miao Cyberboard R4. While that particular keyboard isn&apos;t designed to be portable — it weighs 7lb — I have a decent number of Bluetooth-enabled keyboards that I usually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/ipad-pro-2022-productivity">connect to the iPad Pro</a> to write when I&apos;m not at my desk.</p><p>Most of these keyboards tend to have 65% or 75% designs, and while I usually prefer full-size switches, they tend to be bulky. That&apos;s why I was intrigued when Cherry announced it was making low-profile mechanical switches; the Corsair K100 Air was a terrific showcase, and Lofree&apos;s Flow continues to be one of the best options in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SfWUkUbiqUFYV9L6MtoUyB" name="wombat-willow-pro-16.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SfWUkUbiqUFYV9L6MtoUyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Willow Pro is a new entrant in this segment, offering a unique full-size design that is noticeably narrower than its rivals. Wombat is a sub-brand of KSI Keyboards, and the Willow Pro is an interesting choice as it combines low-profile switches with a custom full-size design. The keyboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KSI-WOMBAT-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches-Bluetooth/dp/B0D1T173QK">costs $144 on Amazon</a>, and it is available via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wombatkeyboards.com/products/willow">Wombat&apos;s website</a> as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PwMjB4JNxGspJKajZCJcSA" name="wombat-willow-pro-1.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwMjB4JNxGspJKajZCJcSA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. The Willow Pro has a grey color scheme that contrasts well with the dual-tone white and grey keys, and the yellow spacebar and arrow keys makes the design stand out a bit. The keyboard uses an aluminum top plate and a plastic base, and there are no issues with the build quality itself. There&apos;s no flex to the chassis, and after four months of use, there isn&apos;t any visible wear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mgCRm9triVixppNJsxdjiA" name="wombat-willow-pro-2.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgCRm9triVixppNJsxdjiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key talking point is the unique configuration; the Willow Pro has a tall design that sees the functions and system keys located on top, with the number pad to the right. This means you get a full-size design without the keyboard taking up as much room on your desk, and while it is taller than most keyboards, it is the same width as most 75% designs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iZdfTVRM4c86GLJkXY6otC" name="wombat-willow-pro-14.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZdfTVRM4c86GLJkXY6otC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the positioning of the system keys isn&apos;t ideal. I usually reach the Delete key with my little finger as it sits to the right of the Backspace button, but in this instance, you get the number pad instead. Barring that annoyance, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the design, and it is a novel way to cram all the keys into a smaller profile.</p>

<p>What I like about the design is that the rubber feet at the bottom are magnetized, so you can easily adjust the angle. I usually prefer a six-degree angle, and while the keyboard doesn&apos;t go to that level, there&apos;s a four-degree angle with the feet raised, and it makes using the Willow Pro that much more convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nFcNVx6PhkJW37npzbMmTD" name="wombat-willow-pro-7.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFcNVx6PhkJW37npzbMmTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used several low-profile keyboards with mechanical switches, and the Willow Pro gets a lot right in this area. The keyboard uses Gateron&apos;s Red low-profile linear switch, and it is one of the best options you&apos;ll find today. The switch has a 50gf actuation with total travel of 3.0mm, and it does a great job mimicking the tactility of a full-size switch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YVhXFmyFFNwxrhqtNu4iYE" name="wombat-willow-pro-8.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YVhXFmyFFNwxrhqtNu4iYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is great in daily use, and it provides all the benefits of a linear mechanical switch without taking up as much room. The sound profile is decent, but you get a hollowness to the sound that&apos;s down to the plastic bottom case. Given what the Willow Pro costs, Wombat should have used an all-metal enclosure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YufRAR5HimV3wmpQxFRkFB" name="wombat-willow-pro-4.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YufRAR5HimV3wmpQxFRkFB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other than that, there are no issues with using the Willow Pro. The PBT keys are durable, and they have clear legends. There is vibrant RGB lighting, but as the legends don&apos;t shine through, you get diffused lighting as standard. Like other low-profile keyboards, the switch is soldered.</p><p>You can use the Willow Pro with Windows and macOS, with additional keys included in the box. As the keyboard has Bluetooth connectivity, you can pair it to an Android phone or tablet as well, and in my usage, I connected the keyboard to my iPad Pro 13 2024 most of the time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vf67TXPgJPQLWxpcYWV7nB" name="wombat-willow-pro-13.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vf67TXPgJPQLWxpcYWV7nB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wombat has its own software utility, and you can customize macros with relative ease. I would have preferred VIA integration instead as it allows greater flexibility, but Wombat&apos;s software isn&apos;t as clunky as other brands I used, and it has a decent level of customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdA7iScdnRvmtD5ztmvmeC" name="wombat-willow-pro-17.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdA7iScdnRvmtD5ztmvmeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only problem with the keyboard is battery life; the Willow Pro has a 1000mAh battery, and that&apos;s on the lower end of the scale as these things go. With RGB lighting enabled, the keyboard doesn&apos;t last a full day of use, and while I was able to get it go two days between charges by disabling RGB effects, that&apos;s still not good enough.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vG4VNB8aEGonZgA5NuaGGD" name="wombat-willow-pro-6.jpg" alt="Wombat Willow Pro mechanical keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vG4VNB8aEGonZgA5NuaGGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Willow Pro has a good design and build quality, and while full-size keyboards are an outlier these days — particularly with low-profile switches — it&apos;s good to see a manufacturer catering to that niche. If you don&apos;t mind the battery constraints, this is a great overall choice.</p>

These communities are not prepared for this sort of disaster like other places are, and the clean-up is going to be slow and painful. We here at Android Central and across the Future brands wish everyone well and are hopeful that people will be able to return to a normal life sooner rather than later.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to help out victims and survivors, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation.html/">you can donate to the Red Cross</a> or sign up as a volunteer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">Verizon is having an unplanned outage</a> over much of the United States including areas impacted by Hurricane Helene making communication difficult or even impossible for many. It doesn&apos;t appear that the two are connected, as people across the U.S. in unaffected areas also report issues with Verizon. That&apos;s little consolation to people trying to survive another day, though.</p><p>There are two very important things you need to know about if you&apos;re a Verizon customer: Satellite messaging and disaster roaming.</p><p>If your phone is equipped with emergency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-satellite-sos-explained">satellite services</a> like recent iPhones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series, you can use it to send out a message for help. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/text-via-satellite-iphb9262f4dd/ios#:~:text=and%20Canada%20website.-,Use%20iMessage%20via%20satellite,Tap%20Use%20Messages%20via%20Satellite.">To enable and use satellite messaging on the iPhone, head here</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15254448?hl=en">To enable and use satellite messaging on your Pixel 9, head here</a>.</p><p>With the iPhone, you can use satellite services for non-emergencies as well, so don&apos;t be afraid to text your friends and family. They want to hear from you.</p><p>I realize this may not help people who can&apos;t get connected, but if you can, visit these links and share them — especially with responders and volunteers.</p>

<p>Another important thing to know is that the state of North Carolina has enabled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/wireless-network-resiliency-during-disasters">disaster roaming rule</a>. This means anyone with any phone can connect to any available cellular provider provided your phone has the correct network capabilities (it probably does). This means Verizon customers can connect using AT&T or T-Mobile infrastructure to make calls and send messages.</p><p>This is important because not everyone has a new phone that can connect to a satellite, especially in rural areas most affected by Hurricane Helene. The list of satellite-supported <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is unfortunately thin, but there are a number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/first-spacex-satellites-launch-for-breakthrough-direct-to-cell-service-with-t-mobile?cmpid=HEIS_AF_U_HMEINTPZ_HRKGJX7WMDYBQJAS76467&clickref=1101lzJxKPUZ&publisher_id=305950">companies</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.starlink.com/business/direct-to-cell">working</a> to make this a more ubiquitous feature across devices and carriers (Motorola even launched a device that more or less <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-defy-satellite-link">brings Satellite connectivity to any phone</a>). Hopefully, disasters such as this can help provide a bit of added urgency to get these services off the ground. Until then, we have to work with what we have.</p><p>To use disaster roaming, you simply need to go into your phone&apos;s network settings and make sure roaming is enabled. Don&apos;t worry — it&apos;s not going to cost you anything and it might get you connected in a pinch.</p>
<p>Verizon will get things sorted out in due time, but until then, some people absolutely need to be able to use their phones. Playing games and using social media can be fun, but the main purpose of your smartphone is still to be in touch with the people you care about and care about.</p><p>If you&apos;re affected by Hurricane Helene or have friends and family who are, I hope they are safe and sound. Material things can be replaced, and there should be plenty of help in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google Phone app is set for a makeover, swapping out the single call button for a new look featuring dedicated buttons for accepting and rejecting calls.</li><li>The accept button will be on the right, and the reject button on the left, unlike Samsung’s layout, which is flipped.</li><li>This feature seems to be in limited testing, so not everyone will see it right away, even if they have the latest app version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Phone app on your Android devices could be getting a fresh look soon, replacing the single button that currently shows up when you get a call.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-incoming-call-ui-test-apk-teardown-3485981/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is testing a new incoming call screen in the latest Phone app update (version 145.0.672690850), and it looks a lot like the iPhone’s call interface.</p><p>Right now, the Google Phone app uses a swipe method to manage calls—swipe up to answer, swipe down to decline. This is different from iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, which have separate green and red buttons for answering or rejecting calls. People familiar with those setups will probably find Google’s upcoming interface change more user-friendly.</p><p>Sitting above the phone button is a "Message" option that makes it easy to fire off a quick text, letting the caller know you&apos;re tied up or can’t talk at the moment.</p><p>The report shows off a screenshot of the Phone app&apos;s refreshed incoming call screen, replacing the old swipe-to-accept button with dedicated buttons for answering and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-block-all-incoming-calls">rejecting calls</a>. This shift mirrors the iPhone’s dialer and the call screens on many other Android devices, like Samsung’s.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:360px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH" name="Google-Phone-app-New-incoming-call-UI.jpg" alt="New Google Phone app interface for incoming calls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGyEm7uesTD3cKeMpeEZxH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="360" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iDeepak_Sharma / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The color-coded buttons make the interface easier to use, providing quick visual cues that help users respond faster, especially in busy situations.</p><p>To make things easier to reach, the accept button is on the right side of the interface, while the reject button is on the left. In contrast, Samsung takes a different approach, with the accept button on the left and the reject button on the right.</p><p>It’s hard to say how many people are seeing this feature since it looks like it’s just being tested with a small group of users who updated to the latest app version.</p><p>Google appears to be rolling out the new incoming call screen UI with a server-side toggle, so even if you’ve got the latest Phone app version, you might not spot this feature just yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many Quest 3S games will have graphical enhancements over the Quest 2?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>As of fall 2024, there are nearly 100 Meta Quest 2 games we know of with specific Quest 3 and 3S patches for improved performance and graphics, and the total number could be higher. Plus, there are dozens of Quest 3S games with mixed-reality modes that look much worse with Quest 2 passthrough.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, your games library will have faster loading times by default. However, some developers patch their games to fully exploit the extra power for higher refresh rates, new textures, better lighting and shadows, and other visual upgrades that the Quest 2 couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Meta confirmed in its <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-3s-announced-connect-2024" target="_blank">Connect 2024 blog post</a> that any "games ... that received Quest 3-specific performance updates will also work day one on Quest 3S, which means you’ll benefit from the same upgraded visuals and faster load times."</p>
<p>We also spoke with Meta VP Mark Rabkin at Meta Connect 2024 about this, and he confirmed that there is "100% compatibility between the 3S and the 3" in terms of game performance.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-meta-quest-3s-game-enhancements-can-you-expect-2">What Meta Quest 3S game enhancements can you expect?</h2>

<p>By default, the Meta Quest 3S has better GPU performance than the Quest 2 thanks to its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. But otherwise, Quest 3S games will still <em>look</em> and <em>run</em> like Quest 2 games unless developers patch them to take greater advantage of the new hardware.</p><p>In the Quest 3 graphical showcases above and below, you can see how Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Chapter 2 and Red Matter 2 look dramatically better on the Quest 3 because of Quest 3-specific patches.</p><p>In Walking Dead, Skydance could only add a few zombies on screen at a time with the Quest 2, but can fit entire hordes onto the Quest 3 version, making it more challenging. Walls and buildings have much more detail, outdoor environments lose the obscuring fog and look more vibrant, and NPCs appear more real. This will also apply to the Quest 3S.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljehojScnCQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/red-matter-2-first-impressions">Red Matter 2</a>, developer Vertical Robot specifically pointed out how the Quest 3 patch added increased rendering resolution and 4K textures with 16X the pixel count in the environment, as well as dynamic shadows and high-quality shadow filtering.</p><p>There&apos;s no universal list of Quest 3S enhancements because developers use the extra power however they choose. But the most common enhancements are higher refresh rates, more detail at further distances, and better textures, shading, and reflections. </p><p>These updates originally targeted the Quest 3 and offered resolution boosts. The Meta Quest 3S can&apos;t take advantage of this because it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">loses to the Quest 3</a> for display resolution, FoV, and clarity. However, all of the other Quest 3 graphical and performance enhancements apply to the Quest 3S by default.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GY2MCBVN7ebB4yC6waP4He" name="meta-quest-3s-press-photo-1.jpeg" alt="A man wearing the Meta Quest 3S playing an exercise game." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GY2MCBVN7ebB4yC6waP4He.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Meta doesn&apos;t have a specific Quest Store category for every Quest 3 game with enhancements that we could find. But it does have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/7552117818138723/">mixed-reality games section</a> that includes over 60 titles as of September 2024; some of these may technically work on Quest 2 with its black-and-white, 4 pixels-per-degree passthrough, but they look significantly better with full-color, 18 PPD passthrough.</p><p>Mixed reality aside, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAOsGIT1pZZssiyt-TjI-pAwCsEWCo3kCmqV7fmnG0s/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">unofficial spreadsheet</a> from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1dkxc4c/list_of_quest_3_upgraded_games/?rdt=41740">Redditor FrancoisFromFrance</a> has a list of about 90 Quest 2 games that received Meta Quest 3 patches, and the total number may be higher. It should give you a general idea of which of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> will immediately look next-gen on Meta Quest 3S.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Quest games</a>, most developers launch with a universal Quest version and then add a Quest 3 patch as a post-launch add-on. That&apos;s why we expect the total number of Quest 3S enhancements to balloon even higher now that Meta has two headsets with next-gen CPUs and no longer sells the Quest 2.</p>

<p>As we mentioned above, some mixed-reality Quest 3 games technically work on Quest 2, but not especially well. Others are VR games with mixed-reality modes that only work on the Quest 3. And a few MR games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/laser-dance/7209598115800315/">Laser Dance</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/hello-dot/25825290007070369/">Hello Dot</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/living-room/7778145568911617/">Living Room</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/starship-home/5959677854068956/">Starship Home</a> will be Meta Quest 3S and 3 exclusives because full-color passthrough is essential to gameplay.</p><p>We expect most mixed-reality games in 2025 and beyond will be Quest 3S exclusives, while VR games with MR modes will still work on both headsets.</p><p>A second, much smaller category is AAA games that only work on the Quest 3 and 3S because the Quest 2 can&apos;t handle the graphics.

<p>First, let’s take a look at how these two phones compare in terms of design. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, the newest addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 line</a>, falls into its “Fan Edition” line. It has a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 3x FHD+ 1,080 x 2,340 display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60 to 120Hz, depending on the application at hand. The display also features Vision Booster, which helps boost the brightness in outdoor environments along with 1,900 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Available in fun colors like Blue, Graphite, Mint, or Yellow, it’s durable with an IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating. With an aluminum frame, the screen is also Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ for added durability. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">his initial Galaxy S24 FE hands-on review</a>, Android Central senior editor Andrew Myrick says the phone looks virtually identical to the previous generation Samsung Galaxy S23 FE and even to the Galaxy S24 Plus. </p><p>It comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage that isn’t expandable beyond cloud services. So, you’ll want to pay extra for the largest option if you tend to snap a lot of photos and videos, keep files, playing games, or download lots of apps. </p><p>Running Android 14 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">Samsung One UI 6.1</a>, you get the latest OS along with seven years of OS and security updates. So, you can be confident that this phone will last and be usable and relevant for many years to come, beyond just its physical durability. </p><p>In terms of battery life, the 4,700mAh battery promises “long-lasting” life of about up to 21 hours of Internet usage. It also includes fast charging that will get you back up to 50 percent after a half-hour charge using a separately purchased 25W adapter and 3A USB-C cable. It also boasts fast wireless charging with WPC chargers and Wireless PowerShare. </p><p>Other basics include Bluetooth 5.3, which includes Bluetooth hearing aid support, Samsung Knox security, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> support, SmartThings support, and, of course, 5G connectivity. The phone will be officially available for purchase at the beginning of October 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb" name="google-pixel-8a-lockscreen-green.jpg" alt="The lockscreen of the Google Pixel 8a with large, chunky clock numbers and a green theme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pegdUwvL2eBZqCQe3wmCGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Google Pixel 8a</a> compare? Announced in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a is the affordable alternative in the Pixel 8 line, which has since been followed up with by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> line. It surprisingly has many of the same features you’ll find in the Google Pixel 8, but with a smaller 6.1-inch Actua OLED screen with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,400 nits brightness or 2,000 nits peak brightness. </p><p>Its screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which also has a fingerprint-resistant coating. However, it has a lesser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-pixel-8a-waterproof">IP67 water and dust-resistant rating</a>, so it isn’t as durable as the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE in that respect. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-google-pixel-8a-should-you-buy">Pixel 8a color options</a> include Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay, or a limited-edition Aloe color, and the Google Pixel 8a is made of matte composite with a matte aluminum frame. Nicholas Sutrich said in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">his Pixel 8a review</a> that he likes the rounded corners and finds the phone comfortable to hold.  </p><p>It comes loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and the same seven years of OS and security updates along with Feature Drops that bring new functions to the phone on a consistent basis. So, both devices will hold their value. </p><p>You get only 128GB or 256GB storage options and no expandable memory card slot, so keep this in mind if you think you’ll need more space. There are always cloud services, but Samsung offers a 512GB option for a bit more money, which might be more palatable. However, keep in mind that the Google Pixel 8a comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> trial, though you’ll still need a long-term solution if you’re a digital packrat. </p><p>With a 4,492mAh battery, you get a rated more than a day per charge, though it’s still technically a smaller battery than what’s in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a>. You can also extend battery life to up to 72 hours using the Extreme Battery Saver mode, which limits functions if you just need to make sure it doesn’t die on your before you can get to a power outlet. It also supports both fast and wireless charging. </p><p>There are also stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, and all the other expected inclusions.</p>

<p>Before diving into the operation and cameras, let’s take an at-a-glance look at the specs.</p>

<p>There are some notable differences between these two phones, including in the processor, cameras, and overall size.</p>

<p>If you find the other Samsung Galaxy S24 series phones too rich for your blood, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE was launched at the end of September 2024 to help bring a premium experience to the masses on a budget. </p><p>While the phone, which runs Android 14, includes all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI goodies</a> you would expect in a premium device, it’s also powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400 series chipset</a>, which means it might not run as efficiently as the higher-end models in the line. The processor is Samsung’s own, designed to compete against rivals (like Google’s Tensor G3). It’s used in variants of many Samsung phones in other countries. Samsung claims it offers increased CPU performance and particularly a boost in AI performance.</p><p>In his brief hands-on tests of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, Myrick found the processor fast and snappy. However, he notes that Samsung uses Snapdragon processors in the other Galaxy S24 devices, so the phone has a clear disadvantage with its underclocked Exynos chip.</p><p>Samsung says this processor enables a favorable gaming experience thanks to features like Ray Tracing and a larger vapor chamber to improve cooling. Features like the bigger battery and screen, refresh rate, and Vision Booster also presumably contribute to the mobile gaming experience. The phone has 8GB RAM, which is sufficient for multitasking, gaming, and more. </p><p>In terms of AI, you can access all the same AI features you can on other Galaxy S24 devices. This includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for searching or scribbling over an item on a web page or in a video, for example, to learn more about it. There’s also Interpreter Mode for translating in-person conversations, lectures, presentations, and more. It’s even usable when offline. With Live Translate, you can translate phone calls in real time, including using popular third-party apps. </p><p>For productivity, there’s also Composer that generates suggested text based on keywords in e-mails and supported social media apps. Note Assist, meanwhile, helps you while taking notes by automating formatting and translation, even transcribing and summarizing voice recordings. </p><p>One thing Myrick wonders, however, is if the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE will be left behind when new, more powerful AI tools are launched that it can’t support. That’s something to think about if the AI experience is at the top of your mind. </p><p>With Samsung Knox, you get multiple layers of security to protect your sensitive data and web surfing. This includes real-time threat detection.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a is powered by the same Google Tensor G3 chip you’ll find in other Google Pixel phones launched in 2023, so there’s no step down in that respect. It also has 8GB RAM and the same AI features you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE and its Pixel siblings, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.  </p><p>Google adds some additional flavor through the built-in Gemini AI assistant, including Pixel Call Assist, Call Screen, Direct My Call, Hold for Me, Clear Calling, and more. With Audio Emoji, you can create your own soundtrack audio effects during a call, like applause or laughing. </p><p>Sufficient for gaming, too, the Google Pixel 8a’s thermal management is one area that Sutrich highlights as being especially impressive. In his tests, it performed even better than the Pixel 8 Pro. So, if you’re a gamer, this phone will work for you, too. </p><p>Protected by security features as well, the Google Pixel 8a comes with VPN by Google One, the Tensor security core, a Titan M2 security chip, and anti-malware and phishing protection.

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-selfie-camera-viewfinder.jpg" alt="Selfie Camera viewfinder on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vx4LkhsVrr6FYWSMWRpFiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s look at the camera experience. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has a 50MP wide lens along with an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. Both are supported by optical image stabilization (OIS). There’s also a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 10MP selfie camera. These are decent specs but nothing to write home about. </p><p>What does stand out is Samsung’s ProVisual Engine, an AI-driven camera engine that the company says helps improve your photos and videos. AI image signal processing (ISP), for example, helps improve low light photography when in Nightography mode. AI zoom helps enhance image quality at distances between digital zoom lengths. </p><p>There’s also an Object-Aware Engine that recognizes scenes and optimizes colors in Super High Dynamic Range (HDR) so you get more lifelike photos and videos, according to Samsung. </p><p>There are neat photo editing tools as well through Photo Assist once you have captured images and want to make them better. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a> can be used to move or remove objects in the background. Portrait Studio allows you to apply styles to photos, like cartoon, comics, watercolor painting, or sketch. With Edit Suggestion, remove flaws in photos like reflections. Instant Slow-mo, meanwhile, helps create more compelling videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-04.jpg" alt="Taking a picture with the Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wguYhL8vMy4cZdLd8mztwc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Naturally, the Google Pixel 8a also has some compelling photo-taking and editing features that leverage AI. It has a larger 64MP quad PD wide camera with Super Res Zoom up to 8x. The ultra-wide camera is 13MP combined with a 13MP front camera. You don’t get a telephoto camera with this phone, though. </p><p>Enjoy Google features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for moving or resizing objects and using preset backgrounds, and Best Take for taking the best elements of several photos of the same thing (think group photo) to create the best one. There’s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for removing distracting elements from a photo, Photo Unblur for adding clarity to otherwise blurry photos, Real Tone for more accurate skin tones, Face Unblur, Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and more. For videos, there’s an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature that you can use to remove distracting background noise. </p><p>After trying the Pixel 8a cameras, Sutrich says the results are fabulous, with good contrast, color accuracy, and capturing of subjects in motion. For now, we have not been able to extensively test the Galaxy S24 FE, but we plan to fully evaluate the camera in a full review.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-google-pixel-8a-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-03.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGSkRHnqKk46sKBJPCcv8R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5057" height="2848" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the big decision between the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE vs. Google Pixel 8a. While the Google Pixel 8a is slightly older, it’s still a relatively new phone that offers seven years of OS and security updates. And it hasn’t even been a year since it came to market. Considering it&apos;s cheaper, has a more powerful processor, tons of AI features, and isn’t that big a step down from the Google Pixel 8, that phone offers tremendous value for money and is the better option of the two. It remains the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> you can buy. </p><p>With the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, you’re dealing with a (potentially) pared-down processor, and while we haven’t tested it fully yet, it may not run as efficiently as you hope in the long run nor be able to support AI features coming down the pipe years from now. If you’re a casual user, you might not mind. However, considering that it’s still more expensive than the Google Pixel 8a, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE might not make sense to many. Myrick agrees, noting the Galaxy S24 FE would be a much more compelling option if the pricing dropped by a hundred or more bucks. </p><p>What are the reasons to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE instead? If you want to stick within the Galaxy smartphone universe, it’s the most affordable model in the new line. It is more durable than the Google Pixel 8a with a higher water- and dust-resistance rating. It also has a much larger screen, so if you prefer bigger over compact and would make use of the extra screen real estate, it might suit your needs better. </p><p>There’s also the bigger battery and the option for a 512GB variant that could sway your decision. Though considering the approximately $200 delta in price, when you look at the 512GB version, you could sign up for years of cloud storage with the savings. </p><p>If you aren’t interested in getting all the AI goodies and just want a solid yet affordable Samsung Galaxy phone, another option to consider is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Samsung Galaxy A series phone</a>. This mid-range line includes several popular models, including newly introduced ones, some of which sell for even under $200. If you go up the line, you can find a phone that’s comparable in price to the Google Pixel 8a that gets you into the Galaxy space without breaking the bank. Just note that many of these phones sport an Exynos processor as well and aren’t as feature-rich as the Galaxy S24 FE. </p><p>The only real reason to go with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is if you are adamant about sticking with Samsung and don’t want to fork over $1000+ for a flagship. The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE offers the opportunity to get into the Samsung space for a mid-range price. We just wish it had kept the same Snapdragon processor and found another way to justify the price drop beyond swapping the processor.</p>

<p>If you really want to get a Samsung Galaxy device, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is a premium, new phone at a mid-range price. With seven years of updates, you can be assured it will last for some time. Plus, AI goodies mean it rivals its bigger sisters in that respect. The processor might not support future AI needs, however, so you’ll need to consider that in your decision. But it has a bigger screen and gets you into the S24 family for less.</p></p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Bluetooth has been around for over 25 years and it&apos;s still unreliable compared to Wi-Fi or even cellular. Unless I use matching equipment from Apple or Samsung I have nothing but problems with buffering and connection issues. Why is this still happening in 2024?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance</strong></em></p>
<p>Hiya! I understand your frustration and agree that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-headsets">Bluetooth</a> seems to have more issues than Wi-Fi and cellular (provided you have a good connection) <em>sometimes</em>. That&apos;s the key word here, sometimes. And for some people, in some places.</p><p>The short answer for people who aren&apos;t interested in going deeper: Bluetooth uses a heavily congested slice of frequency, depends on several different proprietary technologies, and different devices have different additions on top of it all.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the right (wrong) place at the right (wrong) time using the right (wrong) equipment, you&apos;re going to have a bad time. Otherwise, Bluetooth can be reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">and even great</a> — it is for millions of people.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is a bit like a layer cake. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-excited-about-android-15-audio-sharing-feature">base, bare-bones implementation</a> can be open-source and openly available using mostly open hardware, and that&apos;s great. But almost nobody uses it that way because it will be exactly what&apos;s described above — unreliable — most of the time.</p>

<p>Companies like Intel, Apple, Qualcomm, and other tech conglomerates have built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">useful additions</a> that make Bluetooth better, more reliable, and even faster on the same frequency because of improved compression. </p><p>If you buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone</a> and a set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/are-airpods-good-earbud-choice-android-users">AirPods</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> and a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds</a>, you&apos;re probably going to have a great experience because both sides on the hardware front use the same software and have been built to work especially well with each other. </p>
<p>That doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t work well with other equipment. It just means that they have been designed to work best with each other. Other, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-true-wireless-earbuds">often inexpensive accessories and equipment</a>, may not have the same additions to Bluetooth and can&apos;t take advantage of higher output strength or better compression, and the experience isn&apos;t going to be the same.</p><p>Chances are it&apos;s still going to be good though, because the biggest issues with Bluetooth depend on the other equipment around you.</p>
<h2 id="it-apos-s-getting-crowded-in-here-2">It&apos;s getting crowded in here</h2>
<p>Without getting into the numbers and buffers, or the intricacies of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance">CSMA/CA</a>, Bluetooth operates in the same "airspace" as 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and plenty of unregulated equipment. The channels in these frequencies are often crowded and when some of the devices make no effort to intelligently work with other equipment, it can be a mess.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm" name="amazonbasics-microwave-review-7.jpg" alt="AmazonBasics Microwave" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wgAcZQnw9Lj599HNPVRyEm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Joe Maring / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest offenders when it comes to Bluetooth network interference are (believe it or not) microwave ovens and old cordless landline telephones. Both emit signals (in the case of a microwave, it&apos;s a byproduct) in the 2.4GHz range and will interfere with both 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Microwaves are especially problematic because they do not know they are causing interference and simply do not care; hit the button to start them up, and they leak radio waves through old inefficient seals everywhere.</p><p>Bluetooth and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi also can interfere with each other, but that&apos;s where CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) comes into play. It&apos;s a network protocol that devices use to actively avoid interference and most of the time it does a good job.</p><p>When Bluetooth signals are faced with interference there can be audio buffering, connection issues, and connections dropping intermittently. There may not be anything you can do about it other than move somewhere else.</p>
<p>As older devices are phased out and old equipment is replaced with newer and more efficient equipment, the problem will "fix" itself.</p><p>These seemingly small problems can all add up to be the reason why Bluetooth is bad for one person while it&apos;s great for another. The equipment and your location are important pieces of the puzzle. Don&apos;t write off the technology because it obviously works well for millions of people, even if it works poorly for you.</p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re likely several months away from Google&apos;s next budget phone, but that&apos;s not stopping the leaks as they reignite previous speculations.</p><p>A collaboration between X tipster OnLeaks and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a">Android Headlines</a> brought about a series of leaked Pixel 9a renderings. There are a couple of standouts with these leaked renderings, such as its large bezels. It seems the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> will sport some rather striking bezels around its display, which features rounded corners.</p><p>Moreover, the renders offered a look at the back of the device and its surprising departure from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">the massive camera bar</a> we&apos;ve seen on the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>There&apos;s a subtle black outline around the supposed dual-camera array and an LED flash off to the side of it. When angled, the renders don&apos;t show a "bump." The Pixel 9a is rumored to do away with the bump, but it&apos;s unclear how/if this will affect the strength of its cameras. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> features a 64MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Google is suspected of continuing to offer a "boxy" design like the Pixel 9 series. The budget variant is rumored to offer flat sides, which these rumors show could take on a matte finish.</p><p>Rumors add the Pixel 9a could sport a 6.1-inch display like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">its predecessor</a> alongside an 8/128GB (RAM/storage) configuration. Additionally, the publication states the phone could pick up a battery that&apos;s "a tad larger" than the 4,492mAh in the Pixel 8a.</p>

<p>Typically the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-alleged-real-life-photos-leak">alleged real-life images</a> appear <em>after </em>the renderings, but that didn&apos;t happen this time. In late August, a set of images posted on Facebook supposedly showcased the Pixel 9a — and that staggering minimalistic camera array change. The camera bump shined in a close-up shot, giving us a detailed look at how flush it might be to the Pixel 9a&apos;s rear panel. The imagery continued to show glimpses at the SIM tray, USB-C port, and speaker grille at the bottom of the device.</p><p>Additional rumors from September suggested Google could pack a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">year-old piece of hardware</a> into the Pixel 9a. Supposedly, the phone could rock the older Exynos Modem 5300 instead of Samsung&apos;s recent 5400 version. Efficiency and cooling were listed among the aspects the device could miss <em>if </em>Google opts for older tech.</p><p>Moreover, the Pixel 9a could also see an odd change to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 SoC</a>. Rumors state the chip could see a "plastic packaging" change that could alter its heating/cooling capabilities. We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">seen this before with the Pixel 7a</a> as Google shifted toward the "worse" IPOP method instead of Samsung&apos;s proprietary FOPLP-PoP.</p><p>This thicker IPOP method could result in the Pixel 9a clinging to the heat its SoC produces, resulting in an overall hotter phone. These are all rumors, so we&apos;ll have to see which way Google&apos;s judgment swings once it&apos;s here.</p><p>The device could launch in Q2 2025.</p>

According to the tipster, Qualcomm&apos;s next chipset could see an estimated 20% price increase over last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>Nothing&apos;s set in stone, however, the tipster states Qualcomm&apos;s SoC price could jump to roughly $190.</p><p>What&apos;s more, DCS has seemingly edited their rumored post on Weibo — fortunately, there&apos;s still a screenshot of the missing addition teasing a potential price increase from MediaTek. Supposedly, the upcoming Dimensity 9400 SoC could see a similar 20% price increase for a possible $155 toll on OEMs.</p><p>DCS states these prices are purely estimations and could shift (negatively or positively) as the year progresses. Either way, next-gen phones preparing to arrive with the SD 8 Gen 4 or the Dimensity 9400 are in for a pricing change. The tipster attributed the speculated price increase to the 3nm process, stating it&apos;s "quite expensive."</p>

<p>A highlight of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is the existence of new, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">beefed-up Oryon CPUs</a>. The company&apos;s chief marketing officer, Don McGuire detailed this new CPU during MWC 2024, stating the custom cores would be paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80 5G </a>Modem-RF system. Consumers and OEMs can expect 5G capabilities alongside satellite communication support.</p><p>The chip is rumored to hit 4.0GHz and grab the Adreno 830 as its graphics partner.</p><p>A price hike isn&apos;t surprising with all of this packed into the SoC. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">Qualcomm&apos;s SVP Chris Patrick stated</a> last October that the company was aiming for "astonishing levels of performance" with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. Moreover, designing the chip with custom cores isn&apos;t cheap, but Patrick seemingly alluded to a "balance" between power, performance, and price.</p><p>With rumors doubling down on Patrick&apos;s confirmation, perhaps we&apos;ll need to brace for an impending price hike. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/expensive-smartphones-2025-xiaomi-3475935/">Android Authority</a> also cited comments from Xiaomi, stating its phones may become more expensive due to flagship SoCs becoming more expensive. The company was reportedly seeking aid from the public about how it should handle this moving forward.</p><p>Elsewhere, MediaTek&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9400-cores-rumor">Dimensity 9400 is rumored</a> to feature Cortex-X5, Cortex-X4, and Cortex-A7 cores alongside some impressive benchmark scores.</p>

<ul><li>Verizon customers experienced network problems throughout the day on September 30. </li><li>The company says it fully restored its network that same evening.</li><li>Reports suggested other networks were also experiencing outages, but AT&T confirmed it was due to customers trying to contact Verizon users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting around 10 a.m. ET, Verizon subscribers began reporting outages via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/">Downdetector</a>. Affected users are unable to send texts or make or receive phone calls, along with seeing their devices showing "Emergency Calls Only." However, after a long day of network problems, Verizon says it has fully restored service to users and that things should be back to normal.</p><p>Earlier in the day on September 30, users took to social media to see if others were experiencing the same problems. According to Downdetector, the majority of the outage seemed to affect those on the East Coast, including Washington D.C. and New York. However, the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/">heatmap</a>" also showed issues in other regions of the country, extending out to the West Coast.</p>

<p>Although customers began reporting these problems at around 10 a.m., Verizon finally acknowledged the "issue" almost two hours later, stating that its engineers are "working quickly to identify and solve the issue."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are aware of an issue impacting service for some customers.

<p>Hours later, Verizon provided an update, stating that it is making progress on restoring its network and that it would "continue to work around the clock to fully resolve this issue."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verizon engineers are making progress on our network issue and service has started to be restored.

<p>Finally, just after 7 p.m. ET, Verizon confirmed that it had fully restored its network and that users should no longer experience issues, apologizing for the inconvenience it caused. However, it suggests that those who are still having problems should restart their devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verizon engineers have fully restored today's network disruption that impacted some customers.

<p>The carrier did not confirm on its account what caused the network outage, which came at an inopportune time while many were dealing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-helene-florida-north-carolina-georgia-09-30-24/index.html">devastating effects of Hurricane Helene</a>.</p><p>Additionally, while there were reports of similar problems with AT&T and T-Mobile customers, the former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1840789134757028036">shared</a> that it was "not experiencing a nationwide outage" and that its national network was operating normally.</p><p>"Down Detector is likely reflecting challenges our customers are having attempting to connect to users on another network," which is clearly referencing Verizon&apos;s outage.</p>
