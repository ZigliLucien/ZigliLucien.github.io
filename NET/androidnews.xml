<p>The Nothing Phone 2a is the newly introduced cheaper, less feature-rich alternative to the Nothing Phone 2. Limited availability aside, it will save you a few bucks but still boasts the signature Glyph interface, massive screen, and Nothing OS customization options, with very minor differences between the two phones.</p></p>

<p>For a few more bucks, you can get the Nothing Phone 2, which adds features like wireless charging support, more light strips on the back, and an improved processor.

<p>When it comes to finding the right phone, you might be interested in looking beyond the usual brands. That’s where a brand like Nothing comes in, and the Nothing Phone 2 vs. Nothing Phone 2a is an interesting comparison. The phones look similar and boast similar feature sets. The Nothing Phone 2a is the newer, slightly step-down, more affordable option. But will it meet your needs, and can you even get it? Let’s take a look.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-the-looks-and-basics-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: The looks and basics</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL" name="nothing-phone-2a-home-screen-red-01.jpg" alt="Nothing Phone 2a with the stock glass red wallpaper" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9uog29bNh6SkAxhM6eyJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 2a has the same Glyph interface with which Nothing fans have become accustomed, with a transparent back that lets you see the inner workings inside. It comes in black, white, or Milk colorways and has a total of three light strips on the back that illuminate to show different actions, from incoming notifications to an expired timer, volume adjustments, and music playback. This is complemented by 26 addressable Glyph interface zones that truly make the phone stand out among others you’ve seen beyond the ones from this brand. </p><p>The screen is an ample-sized 6.7-inch AMOLED with a decent 2,412 x 1,080-pixel resolution and 1,300 nits peak brightness. You get up to 120Hz refresh rate and down to about 30Hz. Encased in a polycarbonate chassis with aluminum side rails coated in a polycarbonate resin, this budget phone is not ultra-rugged by any means. But it does have a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen, and you’ll probably protect the phone in a case anyway. </p><p>In addition to enjoying the lights on the exterior of the device, you can also customize the phone’s screen using themes like monochromatic. Choose from many nothing OS widgets to further personalize the experience so the phone provides all the information you need to get through your day. Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says in his review of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> that the company’s home screen design has a calming quality to it. </p><p>Speaking of which, the Nothing Phone 2a has a 5,000mAh battery that will give you a day or two of use per charge, and it supports 45W fast charging that can get you another day in just 20 minutes. There’s no support for wireless or reverse charging, though. </p><p>The IP54-rated phone can withstand small sprays of water, but it can be submerged. It comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage along with USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers. However, one thing to keep in mind is that as of this writing, the Nothing Phone 2a is only available in the U.K. and India, though those in the U.S. can get their hands on one as part of the developer program. There’s no official word on widespread U.S. availability just yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CqoaiemQLuCy6AzPJ2chVL" name="nothing-phone-2-with-glyph-lights-on.jpg" alt="The Nothing Phone 2's colorways with glyph lights on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CqoaiemQLuCy6AzPJ2chVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does that compare to the Nothing Phone 2? The mid-level step-up, although a year older, is indeed available in the U.S. right now. So, right off the bat, it’s easier to get your hands on. It employs the same Glyph interface, available in dark grey or white. It has more addressable Glyph interface zones at 33 and almost four times the number of light strips at 11. So, this phone shines more brightly on the back and can provide more notifications, or at least more detail with notifications, than the subtler strategy with the Glyph interface on the Nothing Phone 2a. </p><p>It has the same 6.7-inch, 2,412 x 1,080 AMOLED screen but higher peak brightness at 1,600 nits, so you can expect this phone’s screen to be a bit brighter and bolder, perhaps easier to read in direct sunlight. It, too, goes up to 120Hz refresh rate but can also go down to 1Hz, which could make a difference in terms of battery life and efficiency depending on what tasks you’re doing. </p><p>Made of aluminum, it has a premium and lightweight feel to it. Sutrich says the curved back adds to the elegant feel as well. The phone is by and large identical in size to its newer sister device (though oddly slightly heavier as well). It has the same Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen as well, and works with the same Nothing OS, widgets, and more for a customized experience on screen. </p><p>Interestingly, the Nothing Phone 2 has a smaller 4,700mAh battery, though it’s still rated to last a day or more. It also supports 15W wireless charging as well as wired along with 5W reverse charging, with the promise that you’ll get a full wired charge in under an hour. Nonetheless, if you use wireless chargers, you’ll want to stick with this phone. </p><p>The Nothing Phone 2 has the same IP54 rating, so neither of these phones will go swimming with you, nor will they even be used by the pool without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-nothing-phone-2-cases">a protective case</a>. (Note that because of the camera placement on the back and marginal difference in size, you won’t be able to use a Nothing Phone 2 case on the Nothing Phone 2a and vice versa). With the Nothing Phone 2, you get the addition of 512GB storage along with 128GB and 256GB, a potential deciding factor since neither phone offers expandable storage. </p><p>Other features are the same, including USB-C, dual 5G, Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6, NFC, a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, and stereo speakers.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-the-specs-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s see how these two phones compare head-to-head when examining specs alone.</p>

<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-power-processing-and-more-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: Power, processing, and more</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UZGUkwBKCrEUt5HT7eqxAM" name="nothing-phone-2a-back-03.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZGUkwBKCrEUt5HT7eqxAM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both these phones, as noted, look stunning and unique on the outside. But what is going on behind-the-scenes in the inner workings of the devices? </p><p>The Nothing Phone 2a has a slower processor, which is one of the key features that makes it the step-down budget option. It runs on the Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro octa-core processor, which is more than sufficient for everyday activities. In fact, it is more than just sufficient: in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">first impressions review</a>, Sutrich played several mobile games on the device, and they ran without a hitch. This might be in part thanks to the advanced cooling system, large vapor chamber, and large cooling area that helps dissipate heat. </p><p>If you opt for the 128GB version, you’ll get 8GB RAM, but it’s advisable to go with the 256GB variant, which offers 12GB RAM. A RAM booster feature can use any free storage you have as more memory, so the phone runs more efficiently as well. </p><p>The phone comes out of the box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and supports three years of major Android updates and four years of security updates. That’s not quite as long as with some of the bigger brands, but it’s still a decent amount of time to ensure you get the most out of the investment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HWMvWQR5rNXuyhJ9XyPdFN" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-04.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HWMvWQR5rNXuyhJ9XyPdFN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How about the Nothing Phone 2? As the older model, it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> out of the box but supports up to three years of major Android updates (which means you have two left after Android 14) and four years of security updates, which are delivered frequently to the device. </p><p>It runs on the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a> processor, which is still a step down from the most current premium devices, but this is a middle-market phone. Sutrich says he never felt as though the phone’s performance was lacking in any way despite the older processor. He played various games and didn’t experience lag or slowdowns, even with graphics-heavy titles. </p><p>As noted, the Nothing Phone 2 comes with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB capacities, and the smallest storage option is supported by 8GB RAM, while the two larger ones come with 12GB.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-the-cameras-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: The cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM" name="nothing-phone-2a-camera-hump-01.jpg" alt="The camera island on the back of the Nothing Phone 2a with the glyph lights illuminated" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4T9zkW2cPKeM34fPv2VaqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Nothing Phone 2a and Nothing Phone 2 have identical camera systems. This includes a 50MP dual main camera, including an ultra-wide lens and a 32MP front wide camera. You’ll get all the usual features you’d expect for taking photos, like night photography, portraits, zoom, panorama, and more. </p><p>The biggest difference lies in the placement of the cameras: the Nothing Phone 2a has the rear camera in the center of the back, while on the Nothing Phone 2, the cameras are arranged vertically down the left side.   </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bPocTb82x7F93NgB3LQjS6" name="Nothing-phone-2-camera-lenses.jpg" alt="The back of the Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPocTb82x7F93NgB3LQjS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don’t expect to get amazing photos from this phone, at least not when compared to more premium devices. But if you just want to be able to take decent shots, they are both pretty much the same in this respect. It’s worth noting that for anyone familiar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review#:~:text=Android%20Central%20Verdict,battery%20lasts%20over%20a%20day">Nothing Phone 1</a>, Sutrich says the cameras have been “substantially improved” compared to that previous generation model. </p><p>While he didn’t test the cameras in the Nothing Phone 2a at length, Sutrich found that with the Nothing Phone 2, he got crisp and clean shots with decent dynamic range, natural colors, and portrait mode cutouts and bokeh that are “out-of-this-world” good. Assuming the Nothing Phone 2a cameras perform similarly, you’ll be happy with either phone in this respect if you’re stepping up from the Nothing Phone 1.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Nothing Phone 2a vs. Phone 2: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QZt4RmDayLFAy6H6VKqdTM" name="Nothing-phone-2-back-glyphs-on-08.jpg" alt="The Glyph lights illuminated on the back of a Nothing Phone 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZt4RmDayLFAy6H6VKqdTM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the decision between the Nothing Phone 2a vs. Nothing Phone 2. Both phones come in at affordable prices, even with the 512GB/12GB RAM version of the Nothing Phone 2. It comes down to the small details. </p><p>If you want the most built-in storage possible, you’ll want to go with the Nothing Phone 2 since it offers a 512GB option. For those who use wireless charging often, the Nothing Phone 2 is the only phone of the two that supports it. If you have other compatible devices, you’ll love being able to make use of reverse charging, too. </p><p>Since the Nothing Phone 2a is newer, however, it will last a bit longer in terms of software and security updates. But realistically, most people nowadays upgrade their phones within 2-3 years anyway. With that said, if you want a phone you can hang onto for as long as possible, the Nothing Phone 2a is the safer option. </p><p>If you use the phone a lot outdoors, you might appreciate the higher peak brightness of the Nothing Phone 2, and if you do a lot of intense tasks, the better processor and more adaptable refresh rate will make a difference, too. </p><p>The biggest consideration to make is availability. If you’re in India or the U.K., the Nothing Phone 2a is a more affordable option if you’re really pinching pennies and can live with the trade-offs. If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you might not even be able to easily get your hands on the Nothing Phone 2a, at least for now. So, stick with the Nothing Phone 2. In both cases, you’re getting a wonderful device for a killer price.</p>

<p>You won’t find a more affordable phone packed with as many features and with such a unique look as the Nothing Phone 2a. The only hindrance right now is availability since it’s only available in select countries outside of the developer program. But it’s a solid entry-level budget phone that doesn’t make too many concessions when compared to the Nothing Phone 2.</p></p>

<p>With wider availability and step-up features, the Nothing Phone 2 is not a massive jump in price compared to the more affordable Nothing Phone 2a. It is an older model, but it’s barely a year old, so it still has tons of life left. With a brighter screen, better processor, support for wireless charging, and a more prominent Glyph interface, it’s worth the few extra bucks.</p></p>

<ul><li>Chrome for Android now supports non-Google password managers. </li><li>Previously, users were forced to use Google’s password manager and Chrome’s autofill options.</li><li>The new setting isn’t totally reliable, and is currently hidden.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Password managers are all but essential given the vast number of usernames and passwords we have to remember. But up until now, Chrome users have been restricted to using Google’s password manager to save all these details. For many, this limitation could be enough justification to use one of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">best Android browser</a> options. Now, though, a hidden setting may be about to make Chrome a little more appealing.</p><p>Work on integrating third-party password managers with Chrome was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-password-manager-integration-flag-spotted">first spotted</a> in November 2023. Now, X user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1769738419792490577">Leopeva64</a>, the same person who spied that development, has noticed that the setting appears to have gone live on Chrome. </p><p>This means that users are no longer restricted to using Google’s password manager. But as noted in a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/chrome-android-change-default-password-provider/"><u>Android Police</u></a>, the feature is currently hidden, and in order to use it, you need to enable a specific Chrome flag – chrome://flags/#enable-autofill-virtual-view-structure – before the setting will become visible. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4 months ago I showed a new section in Chrome for Android that lets you use other providers to autofill passwords, this feature now works and if you choose the "Use other providers" option, Chrome no longer shows you suggestions from its password manager:https://t.co/Uvgqr181vs pic.twitter.com/leDXe2Lhnx<a href="https://twitter.com/Leopeva64/status/1769738419792490577">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Once the feature has been activated, users can go to the Chrome settings menu, and under Autofill Options is the option to “Use other providers”. Selecting this option will automatically default to whatever password manager you have active in your Android settings.</p><p>Importantly though, there seems to be a good reason why this setting is currently hidden. According to Android Police, while using a non-Google password manager did work for populating passwords, there were issues with trying to save new passwords when entering them for the first time (although you can save them manually). </p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-for-android-alternative-password-manager-3426820/">Other reports</a> also suggest third-party password managers don’t always populate your saved usernames, which indicates the experience is far from polished. This would explain why you have so much trouble activating it at the moment.</p><p>There is no indication of when this feature might be made more publicly available. In the longer term, though, this could make life easier for anyone who prefers an alternative password manager to Google’s default. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google Meet for the web has gained a nifty new feature that initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-touch-ups-on-mobile">ventured</a> into mobile devices last year. It is dubbed portrait touch-up and promises to enhance users&apos; appearance during or before conference calls.</p><p>In the announcement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/03/google-meet-portrait-touch-up-web.html">Google Workspace post</a>, the search giant says that the new portrait touch-up can be utilized to lightly touch up the user&apos;s appearance before attending (here&apos;s a quick how-to-use Meet&apos;s virtual green room to check yourself before a call) or during the meeting. The feature seeks to make users feel "comfortable and confident" in their appearance while taking up video conferencing calls.</p><p>The portrait touch-up provides two modes of play: subtle and smooth. The former offers light complexion smoothing, under-eye lightning, and eye whitening. On the other hand, Smoothing offers slightly more complexion smoothing next to under-eye lightning and eye whitening.</p>

The feature can be found in the Appearance section at the top right, next to Backgrounds and Filters. There is a new toggle, which, when enabled, gives users to choose either Subtle or Smoothing mode. Users have to bear in mind that the feature will be turned off by default and should be enabled by the user. </p><p>It is encouraging to see Google expanding the touch up feature from mobile devices to the web and catching up to other popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-teleconferencing-apps-android">video-conferencing apps</a> that already have such or similar features.</p>
<p>The first rollout of the portrait touch up mode for Google Meet for the web has already begun for those on the Rapid Release domains over the weekend. As Google notes in the announcement post, the extended rollout will be after April 1, 2024.</p><p>The feature for Google Meet users will be available to Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Starter, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, Teaching & Learning Upgrade, Google One, and Google Workspace Individual subscribers.</p>

This might not be newsworthy by itself, but the talent and history behind Flat2VR Studios have us extremely optimistic about what this could mean for VR gaming.</p><p>Flat2VR Studios will "collaborate closely with top developers from the VR modding scene to bring officially licensed VR ports of popular flatscreen games to a wide audience, offering a fresh, immersive dimension to beloved titles," Impact Reality&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IWecBrVQI8LZ4Ec6SD0LFNhbbn5pMF9FgWA2-WneFM/edit" target="_blank">press release</a> reads.</p><p>The new team includes Holger Frydrych (Cabalistic) — who developed mods for Half-Life 2, Portal 2, Crysis, Far Cry, and other classics, as well as a popular VR performance toolkit — and Raicuparta, the modder behind unofficial ports of Outer Wilds, Neon White, Firewatch, and Stanley Parable. </p>

<p>Along with these Flat2VR devs, the studio now includes Team Beef, the modders who brought several all-time classics, such as Half-Life 1, Doom, Tomb Raider, Jedi Knight II: Outcast, Prey, and Quest 3, to the Meta Quest via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">sideloading</a>.</p><p>These modders will now turn their talents and experience to "their first licensed VR game port," due out in late 2024 or early 2025. </p>

<p>"There is a tremendous appetite to experience cherished games in an entirely new way with virtual reality," said Elliott Tate, a Flat2VR founder and Impact Reality partner. "With Flat2VR Studios, we&apos;re thrilled to work directly with the best developers to create official, high-quality VR versions of hit titles, available directly on VR storefronts such as Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and Steam."</p><p>The last part of that quote has us most excited. Dedicated PC VR fans can access VR mods for most popular Steam titles, but playing them on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> requires sideloading and a VR-ready PC — too many hurdles for most people. We&apos;d hoped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> would deliver more AAA games with VR ports, but it&apos;s proven <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/one-year-old-psvr-2-disappointing-missed-opportunity">disappointingly light on games</a> one year later. </p><p>Flat2VR Studios has team members who&apos;ve spent years lovingly recreating flat-screen games into VR ports. If they can begin releasing <em>official</em> ports on par with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/resident-evil-4-vr-review">Resident Evil 4 VR</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/myst-vr-would-have-made-ten-year-old-me-cry-happy-tears">Myst VR</a> that you can buy without jumping through hoops, then the Meta Quest 3 could become a new home for classic games, given fresh life with a new dimension. </p><p>Since Meta still hasn&apos;t released its promised GTA: San Andreas VR port, we&apos;ll have to count on Flat2VR Studios to add more retro magic to the list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a>.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is launching a new mid-range phone in China this week.</li><li>It is dubbed the OnePlus Ace 3V and is likely to be rebranded as the OnePlus Nord 4 outside of China.</li><li>The Ace 3V, with a March 21 launch, looks familiar to the OnePlus Nord CE 4, which is launching in India in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus has teased its next mid-range smartphone, the Ace 3V, for the Chinese market along with a launch date of March 21, 2024.</p><p>On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/oneplusmobile">Weibo page</a>, OnePlus released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5013209678020666?from=old_pc_videoshow&mark_id=999_reallog_mark_ad%3A999%7CWeiboADNatural">teaser video</a> of the OnePlus Ace 3V, which revealed the device’s full design. Unlike the previous Nord phones, the Ace 3V will feature a revamped camera module featuring two large sensors, followed by an LED flash also aligned with the rear cameras. </p><p>The device will also sport the popular alert slider, which has been an exclusive feature of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> lately, so it&apos;s good to see on a mid-range OnePlus phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uumLrUQPVs5632J5U9D2xW" name="oneplus-ace-3v.jpg" alt="OnePlus Ace 3V" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uumLrUQPVs5632J5U9D2xW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device is seen showcasing its flat frame on the sides next to rounded corners and a textured finish at the back. It will also be seen in two color variants, one with a purple finish and another with a regular black hue. </p><p>The Ace 3V will sport a punch-hole display on the front, and by the teaser video, the bezels appear minimal. OnePlus also emphasizes the use of the phone as an AI phone for young people (per the translated teaser post).</p><p>Besides that, OnePlus has also confirmed the specifications of the upcoming Ace 3V, which include a Snapdragon 7-series chip and a 5,500mAh battery capacity with 100W SuperVOOC charging support.</p><p>The OnePlus Ace 3V will likely be rebranded as the OnePlus Nord 4 in other regions, including India. However, this design is also seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-ce-4-to-launch-on-april-1-2024">OnePlus Nord CE 4</a>, which is scheduled to launch in the country in April. OnePlus has already confirmed that this phone will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 3</a>, which also takes advantage of AI catered to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phones</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm's new Adreno Motion Engine helps reduce motion artifacts by using AI.</li><li>Gamers will find that PCVR titles streamed over Wi-Fi with supported apps like Virtual Desktop now look even better in motion.</li><li>The latest Virtual Desktop update, v1.30.3, already integrates the functionality into its Synchronous Spacewarp feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re a gamer who uses a headset like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> to play PCVR games over Wi-Fi, a new Qualcomm technology is about to make your games look better than ever while moving. The company&apos;s upgraded Adreno Motion Engine uses a suite of AI algorithms that understand motion better than previous models, resulting in less warping while streaming PCVR games wirelessly with headsets powered by a Snapdragon processor.</p><p>A Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/blog/gpu-motion-estimation-improved-handling-repeating-patterns">blog post</a> details the technique, showing how the algorithm finds patterns in rendered objects and estimates what those objects will look like as you move around. The result is a smoother VR experience that feels like running at a high frame rate even when your PC can&apos;t quite handle all the action.</p><p>But this kind of technology often introduces motion artifacts. These artifacts are extremely obvious to human eyes and brains and can be seen on the left in the example below. Thankfully, Qualcomm engineers have figured out how to minimize this warping and just delivered a new version that you can use today on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/">Virtual Desktop</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.67%;"><img id="ZFP5tCdjo9R7XGJBqorMR" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-adreno-motion-example.gif" alt="A demonstration of motion warping before and after enabling the Adreno Motion Endgine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFP5tCdjo9R7XGJBqorMR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Virtual Desktop&apos;s Synchronous Spacewarp feature implements this new Qualcomm feature as of version 1.30.3. Gamers who use Virtual Desktop to wirelessly stream their PCVR games will find that games should look cleaner as they move around, particularly as framerates drop and the app needs to create frames to keep the action feeling smooth.</p><p>Just head into Virtual Desktop&apos;s option menu and enable "Synchronous Spacewarp" to get access. Impressively enough, it does all of this without any additional latency or processing overhead on the Virtual Desktop app.</p><p>Some official apps, like the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/even-the-new-quest-link-software-cant-save-pcvr-for-me">Quest Link software</a>, don&apos;t always provide a seamless experience. Still, wireless streaming apps like Virtual Desktop often do a better job without the need for a cable. You&apos;ll just need a competent Wi-Fi router or a streaming bridge, like this excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Streaming-Compatible-Accessories-Wireless/dp/B0CFDL5Y7F">PrismXR Puppis S1</a>, to wirelessly beam your PCVR games to your Quest headset.</p><p>Virtual Desktop developer Guy Godin has consistently updated the app with the latest in cutting-edge streaming technology, regularly eclipsing Meta&apos;s official streaming methods by offering higher quality streaming and more options to tweak. It&apos;s been the pick of many PCVR gamers for years for a reason.</p>

<hr>
<p>YouTube highlights the arrival of its new AI disclosure creators must adhere to when uploading videos.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/disclosing-ai-generated-content/">YouTube</a>, today (Mar. 18), the platform is introducing a new set of "Altered content" details creators must fill out. The company adds creators must "disclose to viewers when realistic content – content a viewer could easily mistake for a real person, place, or event – is made with altered or synthetic media, including generative AI."</p><p>This new section will ask creators questions regarding whether or not the people, footage, or scenes in their videos were digitally altered. If the answer to the questions is "yes," YouTube states it will apply a label on your video or Short. Additionally, users can find these labels in a video&apos;s description box.</p><p>Disclosing that your video contains altered or synthetic content will not hinder its discoverability on the platform. The platform states creators who have not properly labeled their videos will receive a label "that creators will not have the option to remove."</p><p>If such behavior continues, YouTube states it will look to remove content, suspend a creator&apos;s account, and other penalties.</p><p>Content that is clearly fantastical and imaginative, like animations, color adjustment, special effects, and beauty filters, does not fall within the scope of altered content. Moreover, creators do not have to worry about penalties if they use AI to generate scripts or captions.</p><p>More information about this new disclosure can be found on YouTube&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491">help page</a>. YouTube viewers will notice these new labels appear "in the weeks ahead" on all devices.</p>

<p>YouTube states that its latest AI and altered content disclosure are part of its efforts to clamp down on misinformation. The company hopes to "increase the transparency" regarding digital content, as well.</p><p>It&apos;s no surprise that YouTube is going down this path as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-others-advance-ai-safety-practices">Google agreed to proceed</a> with measures to help prevent societal risks. The White House urged big tech companies like Google to gain a better handle on AI-generated content and the problems it can have on everyday users. Through its AI safety practices, Google agreed to provide watermarks, metadata tags, and more to inform users when content was synthetically created.</p><p>Users are likely to continue to see these new tags as YouTube is working on several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tv-8-million-subscribers-2024-outlook">generative AI features</a>. The company started rolling out a test for Premium members to test its new conversational AI alongside "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track</a>," which lets creators digitally sample popular artists&apos; voices.</p>

<p>It looks like Motorola is preparing to launch its next flagship phone in India in the near future.</p><p>Motorola India has confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that the Motorola Edge 50 Pro will arrive in India soon. It&apos;s also confirmed to be available on Flipkart.</p>

<p>The post didn&apos;t mention a specific date, but tipster Abhishek Yadav spilled the beans on X, saying the launch is supposedly going down on April 3 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-edge-50-pro-indeed-launching-in-early-april-latest-leak-suggests_id156384" target="_blank">PhoneArena</a>). The tipster even threw in what seems to be official promo material from Motorola, giving us a sneak peek at the Edge 50 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-design-leak">confirming a set of leaked renders we&apos;ve seen before</a>.</p><p>Motorola India&apos;s post also confirms the phone&apos;s design, but the company is keeping the specs tight-lipped. It dropped a few tidbits, though, such as a 10MP telephoto lens with 50x hybrid zoom and some AI camera magic in the mix.</p><p>According to Yadav, the phone might rock a 6.7-inch pOLED display, packing a punch with 1.5K resolution, a super smooth 144Hz refresh rate, and 2,000 nits of peak brightness. Furthermore, it could be shielded by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for extra protection.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some new rumors suggest Samsung will produce design changes for its Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>As rumored by yeux1122 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223385894570&navType=by">Naver</a>, the base Galaxy S25 model might sport an increase in its display size (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-significant-design-changes-base-model-screen-size-increase/">WCCFtech</a>). Citing a Samsung source, the leaker suggests the vanilla model will offer a 6.3-inch display once it launches next year.</p><p>The rumor implies more changes may be expected as Samsung introduces "overall design and concept" alterations for the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>For context, the base Galaxy S24 features a 6.2-inch display. The remainder of the series delivers a 6.7-inch and a 6.8-inch display for the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra, respectively. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> also dropped its curved display, opting for a completely flat display. However, the device retained some of its curvature along its left and right edges.</p><p>More importantly, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus have continued the same clean, minimalistic rear panel that started with the S23 variants. Both of the smaller siblings moved toward a design that mirrored the Ultra model. It&apos;ll be interesting to see what additional changes (if any) Samsung brings in its upcoming S25 series.</p><p>Previous rumors from December 2023 suggest Samsung could drop its camera hardware in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-rumored-to-use-sony-sensors">favor of Sony</a>. Speculation speaks toward the Korean OEM ditching its GN series sensors on the S25 and S25 Plus, should the rumors prove true. The Ultra model was stated to continue the ISOCELL trend. Speaking of, that ISOCELL sensor might pick up an upgrade next year for its 200MP capabilities with 0.8µm pixels.</p><p>Another rumor stated Samsung&apos;s flagship series could become a little pricier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-rumored-price-increase">thanks to Qualcomm&apos;s</a> planned SoC upgrades. The company is expected to implement more expensive Oryon CPU cores into its upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset, which could help it achieve "astonishing levels of performance."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The default cloth Quest 3 facial interface is pretty comfortable, but it has a few obvious flaws. AMVR&apos;s facial interface replacement fixes nearly all of those by using an easy-to-clean and replace PU leather pad, vents to eliminate lens fog, and even a built-in glasses spacer like the default Quest 3 face pad has.</p><p>AMVR was one of the first companies to deliver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> accessories after the headset launched in October 2023. Surprisingly, the company&apos;s offerings are still among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> despite other companies having longer development times.</p><p>The AMVR facial interface replacement for Meta Quest 3 ships with two main parts: the pad and the facial interface adapter. The adapter itself is plastic and slots right into the headset in the same way the default pad does. Unlike the default pad, however, AMVR&apos;s solution separates the pad from the spacer to make things more convenient.</p>

<p>The adapter is lined with brilliantly designed vents that keep light from entering the headset, yet somehow allow moisture and heat to escape. That last part is crucial for preventing lens fog. I&apos;ve had a few instances where the corners of the lenses would still fog in the first few minutes of play, but haven&apos;t had the Quest 3&apos;s lenses completely fog up with this facial interface as they do with the default pad.</p><p>AMVR uses a similar built-in glasses spacer solution to Meta&apos;s, with three preset spacing options and prongs that keep the interface locked into place. I found these were a little hard to adjust since the adapter uses four anchor points, and I often had to readjust the spacing after plugging the adapter into the Quest 3 headset.</p>

<p>The front of the adapter is lined with Velcro-style hooks that fit nicely with nearly every facial interface pad I own. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oculus-quest-2-face-covers">best Quest 2 facial interface</a> pads fit on AMVR&apos;s design, meaning you won&apos;t need to buy a bunch of new pads if you already won a Quest 2, along with some Velcro-backed face pads.</p><p>That makes it easy to remove the pads and clean them after use. It&apos;s also simple to swap them out when needed, which is handy for when you&apos;ve got friends or family over and want to keep them feeling clean by using separate face pads.</p><p>The biggest regular annoyance with this design is the nose seal. It&apos;s barely held on with one small prong on each side of the floppy seal and easily comes undone when changing out the face pad. It&apos;s also annoying to try to push it back into place, but it does such a great job of blocking out light that I find myself going through the hassle of getting it back on when it falls off.</p><p>Overall, this is the best facial interface replacement you&apos;ll find on the Meta Quest 3 today. A tighter nose seal and adjusted glasses spacer design would make it perfect, but neither problem is big enough to complain about much.</p>
