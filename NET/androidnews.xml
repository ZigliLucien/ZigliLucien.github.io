                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet has added a new verification settings menu for Android devices.</li><li>This setting allows users to decide whether or not they need to be verified before paying for a ticket on public transport.</li><li>This will help to make Google Wallet even more secure.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The ability to store card details, transit passes, boarding passes, and contactless payments, means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> is a convenient way to save time.  Now, Google is working hard to make Wallet even more secure and user-friendly by introducing a new ‘Verification settings’ menu.</p><p>The new addition, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/google-wallet-verification-settings/">9to5 Google</a>, lets users decide whether or not verification is required, specifically when paying for a transit ticket. Under “Wallet settings” is the new “Security” heading, under which “Verification settings” are listed. When selected, the user can “choose if you’ll need to verify it’s you when using your items stored in Wallet.” </p><p>At the moment, the only available option here is “Transit payments.” When the “verification required” toggle is on, Wallet will require “verification for paying for bus, metro, and more with a credit or debit card.” This means the usual options for a device include a PIN or fingerprint scan, for example.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="24RZvziPWUj2G9RkvaYvxc" name="Google-Wallet-verification-settings.jpg" alt="Screenshots of the new verification settings menu in Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24RZvziPWUj2G9RkvaYvxc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Phone Arena)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If a user already has a transit pass stored in Wallet, the toggle will be switched on by default. The wallet will then require verification before paying with their bank card. If no transit pass is stored, this option will be automatically turned off. </p><p>This means that anyone without a transit pass can quickly pay for their ticket without needing to verify themselves. Users can, however, switch it on even if they don’t have a transit pass if they want that added security.</p>
<p>Importantly, this feature is only applicable to paying for transit. As it says underneath the toggle: “You’ll still verify for all other payments with this card.” This means that even if you disable the setting, it won’t allow someone to swipe your phone and go wild with your credit card. Although, they may get to enjoy a day out on your local metro system.</p><p>The new setting is available in version 24.10 of Google Wallet. It’s another example of how Google is trying to strike a balance between security and convenience on Google Wallet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">A recent change</a> for some European users where all transactions now require verification (previously, unlocks weren’t always required for small payments) has met a mixed response. Hopefully, this latest update will be a little less controversial.</p>

You can spice things up by adding a new color whenever you need a change. You can make these changes from your device&apos;s settings, so you won&apos;t need to install another app.</p><p>You can also do other things on Google Messages, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-message-reminders-in-google-messages">set message reminders</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photomoji-google-messages">use Photomoji</a>. But now you don&apos;t always have to stare at the same color. Keep reading to learn about your color options and how easy it is to switch between them.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-text-bubble-colors-for-all-chats-in-google-messages-2">How to change text bubble colors for all chats in Google Messages</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following instructions were performed on a Samsung Galaxy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. The steps might be slightly different depending on your device and Android version.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Wallpaper and style</strong>.</p><p>3. Choose the <strong>Color palette</strong> option.</p><p>4. Toggle on the <strong>Color palette</strong> option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="He34sXMiFZZQMHJBiLLS3o" name="Google-Messages-Settings.jpg" alt="Wallpaper and style option in Samsung phone settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/He34sXMiFZZQMHJBiLLS3o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Choose your new color from the Wallpaper colors or Basic colors option. You can&apos;t choose the colors in the Wallpaper colors option since the choices are limited to the wallpaper. The Basic color options give you solid or two color options.</p><p>When you know what color you want to use, tap the Apply button at the bottom. The colors will be applied, and you&apos;ll return to the Wallpaper and style section.</p><p>The steps will be slightly different depending on your phone. For example, for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, the steps would be <strong>Settings > Wallpaper > Change Wallpaper</strong> and choose your new wallpaper that has your preferred color. Depending on the Motorola phone, you may also find this in the <strong>Personalize</strong> option in the settings menu, which gives you the option to adjust the color palete separate from the wallpaper.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a> and Pixel devices have fewer steps since you only need to tap on <strong>Wallpaper and Style</strong> to see the option. Repeat the same steps when you&apos;re ready to change the color again.</p><p>As long as you&apos;re on your Galaxy phone, whether it&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a> or not, you <strong>can also use Accessibility</strong> to change the colors of the text bubbles for Google Messages. It won&apos;t give it a drastic change, but it&apos;s another option. To give it a try:</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Vision enhancements</strong> (or <strong>Color and motion</strong> on Pixels and other Android phones) option.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Color correction</strong> and <strong>toggle on</strong> the option at the top.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="X6DpyVawh6ZhzCtQkaJCLn" name="Vision-enhancements-settings.jpg" alt="Vision enhancement option in Galaxy settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X6DpyVawh6ZhzCtQkaJCLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Choose a color option at the bottom and preview your option in the image above with all the veggies.</p><p>Another option would be to choose <strong>Color inversion</strong> instead of Color correction in the above steps. These two options can be accessed following the same steps.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Open <strong>Accessibility</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Vision enhancements</strong> and swipe down a little to access the Color inversion option. </p><p>You can enable the Color inversion option directly from Vision enhancements. However, if you select it, you&apos;ll see an option to create a shortcut for this feature. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.33%;"><img id="R4sXpyzy3Wj4sVURoRSKQd" name="Vision-enhancements-options.jpg" alt="Vision enhancement options in Galaxy phone settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4sXpyzy3Wj4sVURoRSKQd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2160" height="2340" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> will also give the Google Messages bubble a different look. If you want to give it a try, you can enable it by:</p><p>1. Opening <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Go to <strong>Display</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Dark</strong> option at the top.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-change-text-bubble-colors-for-individual-rcs-chats-2">How to change text bubble colors for individual RCS chats</h2>
<p>With Google Messages, the ability to change the text bubble color of individual chats is also rolling out, although its availability is currently limited since it&apos;s in beta. That said, the steps for RCS (Rich Communication Services) chats are easy and quick for anyone currently in the beta:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the chat</strong> to which you want to give a new color.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>dots</strong> at the top right.</p><p>3. Choose the <strong>Change Color</strong> option. </p><p>4. <strong>Select a color</strong> and tap <strong>Confirm</strong> at the bottom right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1238px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.26%;"><img id="wTBxSCeuY6gaxArsPsUfbd" name="RCS-Messages-Text-Bubbles.jpg" alt="Color change for RCS chats on Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTBxSCeuY6gaxArsPsUfbd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1238" height="845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A notice at the bottom will tell you so when you change the color. Each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> chat can have a different color, and you can go back at any time to choose another color. The color change should also apply to the receiver but don&apos;t worry if that is not always the case since it&apos;s still in beta.</p>
<h2 id="make-your-google-messages-text-bubbles-colorful-2">Make your Google Messages text bubbles colorful</h2>
<p>Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/7-new-messages-features/">seven new features</a> in late 2023 that will change how you use Google Messages. One of those changes is Custom Bubbles, which allows you to change the color of your conversation right from the chat. The changes don&apos;t end there; you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-pin-up-to-five-conversations">pin up to five messages</a>. </p><p>There are many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">tips and tricks for Google Messages</a> you can try. It&apos;s great to see how users get more options regarding their conversations. Only time will tell what other great features you will enjoy.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>GDC 2024 was crammed to the brim with VR games and developers. Meta had a huge presence at the event, as did Quest 3 developers showing off their upcoming virtual- and mixed-reality titles. And while Apple was a no-show, plenty of developers had their Vision Pros on hand to show off prototypes of their upcoming games.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a> has been out for about half a year, developers are still figuring out its evolving mixed-reality technology. I met many developers still working on unfinished prototypes, scoping out GDC to compare notes with fellow developers.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro">Vision Pro</a>, meanwhile, has gotten a handful of developers on board, but Apple itself hasn&apos;t provided much support; several devs told me they&apos;re waiting to see if it&apos;s worth investing in Apple&apos;s ecosystem.</p><p>From show floor demos of recently-launched games to private demos of upcoming titles to watch out for, these are the best Meta Quest and Vision Pro games I had a chance to try out at GDC 2024 — games I think you should keep an eye out for!</p>
<h2 id="laser-dance-2">Laser Dance</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0UowL5cjhaI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I spent about 45 minutes in line with Laser Dance creator Thomas van Bouwel at the Meta booth at GDC, chatting about his mixed-reality game. I&apos;m proud to say that I didn&apos;t let a single laser hit me as I snuck, crawled, and sidled through laser traps.</p><p>The game, which will remind you of Mission Impossible or Ocean&apos;s 12, has you sneaking through increasingly convoluted laser traps through your living room to reach a button on the far wall. If a laser hits you, the grid shuts down, and a ghost appears, showing where the laser struck you on your body, so you know what you did wrong.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4C3DWmNJftFamFUhCsikoL" name="GDC-2024-laser-dance.jpeg" alt="Michael Hicks crawling on the ground playing Laser Dance." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4C3DWmNJftFamFUhCsikoL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Me, crawling under the lasers </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Laser Dance incorporates new Meta mixed-reality tools like dynamic occlusion, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-upper-body-tracking-motion-sickness">inside-out upper body tracking</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-project-aria-automatic-room-mapping">automatic room mapping</a>, and has accessibility settings that take body size and your ability to crawl into account. In other words, it&apos;s meant for almost anyone to play anywhere; van Bouwel says it&apos;s almost <em>better</em> to have a furniture-filled space for Laser Dance than an empty one.</p><p>While the varied layouts make global leaderboards hard to implement, van Bouwel says people will want to race their times after they finish the initial campaign. I&apos;m curious how long the game will be when it launches in 2024, as I sped through the demo very quickly, but my short time with it has already made Laser Dance a day-one buy for me!</p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Due out sometime in 2024; you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSgkpaUPBO99MIWwxNoDqNQgGeau0F-VfdEAiZGouS1xWCCw/viewform">sign up for playtesting</a> if you want to try it now. </p>
<h2 id="vrider-2">VRider</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twdpR9dDbFw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The first words that popped into my mind after playing VRider were "Forza but for motorcycles." I don&apos;t know enough about the Superbike World Championships to recognize the 23 real-life racers included or judge the fidelity of the 12 official circuits and bike designs recreated from Ducati, BMW, Honda, Yamaha, and Kawasaki. But it&apos;s clear the Funny Tales devs I met at GDC are passionate about the sport, and it translated in my demo.</p><p>Quest 2 or 3 owners will hold their Touch controllers in front of them like handlebars and tilt their bodies to turn, with colorful arrows guiding you on the right speed and angle for your turn. VRAL Games is also selling an official accessory that lets you mount your controllers so you can turn them like an actual throttle. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="Hzin2gHSvgh3cwdfoat6B6" name="vrider-gdc-2024-demo.jpeg" alt="The author playing VRider at GDC 2024." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hzin2gHSvgh3cwdfoat6B6.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I quickly fell behind the nine AI racers as I learned the ropes, but the controls feel very intuitive, and I can imagine how fun it&apos;ll be to start learning the ins and outs of each track as you optimize your time. And even though I <em>looked </em>like a hunchback as I leaned into curves with my head behind the windshield, I <em>felt</em> extremely aerodynamic and speedy.</p><p>Even though Laser Dance was my favorite overall experience, I suspect I&apos;m more likely to spend a lot of time in VRider as I race other players in multiplayer or tournaments or challenge the ghosts of other players&apos; top times. Even if you&apos;re not into 2D racing games, I bet you&apos;ll enjoy this version more! Keep in mind that you&apos;ll need some decent VR legs to prevent motion sickness. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Currently in closed beta, we will have an App Lab launch soon, then an official Quest Store launch in the summer, and a SteamVR launch later in 2024. </p>
<h2 id="game-room-2">Game Room</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3cR3_SE2s8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The Resolution Games booth showed off demos for Racket Club and a mixed-reality update to Angry Birds VR, both of which are already on our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. I love Racket Club for how it challenges your reflexes and gets you sweating while offering mixed reality so I don&apos;t smash my hand into a wall. Unfortunately, a months-old game doesn&apos;t really fit on this list, so I&apos;ll focus instead on Game Room on the Apple Vision Pro, which launched this month.</p><p>Playing chess, solitaire, Battleship, and other beloved classics on the Vision Pro reminded me of my early days of computers when I&apos;d challenge the chess CPU or play Minesweeper non-stop. Resolution Games didn&apos;t reinvent the wheel with Game Room, but it has that same early-day vibe when you&apos;re just getting used to the controls and enjoying some simple pleasures.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gqYUbTosYn8xxqzXFrMoVN" name="GDC-2024-apple-vision-pro-resolution-games.jpeg" alt="The author wearing the Apple Vision Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqYUbTosYn8xxqzXFrMoVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since people are buying the Vision Pro to presumably wear for hours a day as they work, Game Room feels like the perfect kind of game to step away from the productivity apps for ten minutes, instead of sinking an hour into streaming Disney+ or whatever. Plus, it&apos;s a great game to introduce family members and friends to the Vision Pro because you can play against them using your iPhone or iPad. </p><p>Given that Vision Pro&apos;s gaming library is pretty weak at the moment, it&apos;s nice to see Resolution Games swooping in to entertain Apple fans. I&apos;m curious to see if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/dungeons-and-dragons-officially-coming-to-vr">upcoming licensed Dungeons & Dragons game</a> will come to Vision Pro next. (Not that I can afford the headset, but people who spent $3,500 deserve fun options besides iPad apps!) </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Available to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-room/id1642897935" target="_blank">here</a>. Racket Club can be purchased on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6022041731249559/">Quest Store</a>. </p>
<h2 id="mega-fireball-2">Mega Fireball</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKLRUUT9u9g?start=17" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Lucky Juicebox, former Niantic engineers who formed their own MR studio, let me try a demo of their 2024 release Mega Fireball in an empty hallway at Moscone Center at GDC 2024. Essentially, it&apos;s a local multiplayer experience where you control a tiny cartoonish animal that tries to knock a soccer ball into a goal. </p><p>What made the demo exciting was that it took my surroundings into account. The hallway was mostly empty, but I could still have my character jump onto water fountains and fountains or wall-jump off ofwalls. In an actual living room, you&apos;ll have your character jumping on tables or couches, and your shots on goal will get blocked by furniture, too. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zeWkLkVv7ZxFhPJyQsKnkV" name="GDC-2024-lucky-juicebox.jpeg" alt="The Lucky Juicebox devs at GDC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zeWkLkVv7ZxFhPJyQsKnkV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Lucky Juicebox devs </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lucky Juicebox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not sure how often two people with Quest 3s will get together in one place, but the devs talked about their hopes of letting games like Mega Fireball use the "mesh" layout of different players&apos; rooms so that you can combine two geographically separate rooms into one playspace. It&apos;s actually the same idea that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/games/virtual-reality/gdc-2024-schell-games-mixed-reality-killer-apps">major VR dev proposed would be a "killer app" for mixed reality</a>.</p><p>They also mentioned that they want to turn Mega Fireball into a "sandbox" where players can create their own MR games or activities using the physics, mechanics, and assets they built. As an example, they described how they made an "action movie" by taking their characters to a local park and recording their characters&apos; movements and attacks there.</p><p>Even though Lucky Juicebox clearly wants to make a Pokemon Go-like experience that would rely on fully augmented-reality glasses you can wear anywhere, that probably won&apos;t happen for a few years, and I&apos;m excited to see what else they do with mixed reality in the meantime. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Out sometime in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="mlb-home-run-derby-vr-2">MLB Home Run Derby VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5Dy1Tnxe4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I&apos;m limited in terms of what I can say about the new Quest port of MLB Home Run Derby VR, which launches on March 28, beyond what was initially announced on March 6. I did try an early build during GDC, however, and I&apos;ll simply point out that I&apos;m including it in this round-up without any other commentary until after the embargo.</p><p>Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/nfl-pro-era-review">NFL Pro Era</a>, it&apos;s an officially licensed title with 30 MLB stadiums, achievements, tournaments, and the chance to progress from a single-A minor leaguer to a major-league superstar. You don&apos;t get the full MLB experience like pitching or fielding, but you do get to practice swinging for the fences!</p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Out March 28, available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/4468078983226058" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a>.</p>
<h2 id="half-life-2-vr-2">Half-Life 2 VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-08KCheaGg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I&apos;m <em>definitely</em> cheating for this pick, as the fantastic Half-Life 2 VR mod has been available for a couple of years now on SteamVR. But the process of booting up my PC, Steam Link, and Virtual Desktop, then tinkering with the settings, makes PC VR too much of a hassle for me most of the time. I&apos;d rather dive right into my Quest library. </p><p>So why bring it up? Because this week, Impact Reality announced a new publishing initiative called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/flat2vr-studios-hires-talented-vr-modders-for-licensed-quest-ports">Flat2VR Studios</a> that&apos;s working on licensed VR ports for various headsets, including the Quest 3. </p><p>The modders on that team have made unofficial VR ports of classic titles like Half-Life 2, Tomb Raider, Jedi Knight II: Outcast, and Doom, as well as more recent games like Neon White and Outer Wilds. You had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">sideload on your Quest</a> to play them, but now, these future licensed titles will be available through the main storefront.</p><p>So far, the team only has one unannounced port in the works. But when I met the kind Flat2VR Studios folks at their GDC booth, they hinted that they&apos;d had some productive conversations with gaming publishers over the last few days and explained that access to a game&apos;s source code would allow them to make much better VR ports than they could do in the past with modding and workarounds. </p><p>My hope is that the Quest 3 (and other headsets) will become a great place to play classic PC titles in the future. </p>
<h2 id="runaways-2">Runaways</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2758px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.91%;"><img id="BbLTzxJKSJnZbnLjwPEPc7" name="Runaways-promo-image.jpg" alt="Runaways press promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BbLTzxJKSJnZbnLjwPEPc7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2758" height="1542" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Beyond)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out my GDC 2024 list of upcoming VR games is this adorable endless runner from New Zealand dev team Beyond, designed for the Apple Vision Pro. You play as Hank — an rebellious alien escaping from an evil tentacled overlord&apos;s planet through a portal — who must leap over obstacles to get as far away as possible. </p><p>Runaways definitely has the vibe of a mobile game in mixed-reality form, with the pinch motion to jump replacing the tap of a display. But just like Game Room, Runaways is the kind of cute, casual escapism that Vision Pro users will want when it launches in April. </p>
<p>The escape track randomly changes with each run. In addition to jumping over track gaps and traps, there&apos;s a trap-disabling button to safely pass through them—except some traps are disabled by default, so you may accidentally kill yourself by activating one if you&apos;re not careful. If you get far enough, you&apos;ll also have to dodge tentacles.</p><p>I love that the game will come with comic books that you unlock by getting far enough away with different characters. Their aesthetic evokes classic comic books, and the story will encourage you to keep improving your high score to unlock new chapters. </p><p><strong>Details: </strong>Launches on Apple Vision Pro in April.</p>

<p>If you look at the full list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming announced Quest games</a>, I&apos;ve only scratched the surface. Many VR devs didn&apos;t make it to GDC, and I couldn&apos;t make appointments with everyone. But there&apos;s plenty to be excited about as a VR or MR fan in 2024. </p><p>It was my first experience with the Apple Vision Pro, and I enjoyed my brief window with it! But it&apos;s also clear that most developers are treating it as a novelty due to the smaller install base. Apple doesn&apos;t seem to have the same rigid restrictions and hoops Meta has to get on the Quest Store, but it also doesn&apos;t offer the same gaming support.</p><p>On the flip side, even though the Quest 2 remains more popular than the Quest 3, developers seemed more willing to experiment with mixed-reality functions that only really work on the newer headset. Resolution Games, for instance, told me that half of Demeo players use MR mode over VR mode, while slightly less do so for Racket Club. It&apos;s clear that VR gamers want to see their surroundings, at least sometimes.</p><p>Also, since the cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3 Lite</a> allegedly will have full-color passthrough when it launches later this year, that makes it more likely that more gamers will use mixed-reality tech moving forward. I&apos;m hoping that means we&apos;ll see more games like Laser Dance in the near future!</p>

<ul><li>Some of the best features available on the Samsung Galaxy S24 series will make an appearance on older phones via the One UI 6.1 update.</li><li>Samsung previously said that the One UI 6.1 update would come to Galaxy devices from 2023 in March 2024.</li><li>That means it would make sense that a One UI 6.1 update would come this week, and Samsung has already confirmed that it will be available on March 28 in China.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s new lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, the Galaxy S24 series, came with a slew of new artificial intelligence features. These are slated to make their way to Galaxy devices released in 2023 with the One UI 6.1 update. Samsung previously said that the One UI 6.1 update would be available in March 2024, and time is running out for the company to meet that self-imposed deadline. However, signs are pointing to a release of One UI 6.1 this week. </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1771404869775278287" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Tarun Vats shared a notification from Samsung that stated OneUI 6.1 would roll out in China starting March 28 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/25/samsung-one-ui-6-1-update-release-date-rumor/">9to5Google</a>). The notification is fairly specific, covering the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and S23 Ultra. Besides being limited to those devices, it explicitly confirms the release date for users in China, not the rest of the world. However, it&apos;s reasonable to expect that One UI 6.1 will debut this week in other regions. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Attention to all Galaxy S23 users!In China, One UI 6.1 officially rolls out starting March 28th as per the notification received todayHere's hoping it hits Asia and Europe too🤞🤞Repost to show excitement#GalaxyS23 #OneUI #OneUI6 #GalaxyS23Ultra #OneUI6dot1 #Samsung pic.twitter.com/G7o33TjeBo<a href="https://twitter.com/tarunvats33/status/1771404869775278287">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Samsung first shipped the One UI 6.1 update as the day-one software for the Galaxy S24 series. It includes the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI suite</a> of AI-enhanced software features, and users quickly speculated whether these tools would come to older phones. Later, the company confirmed that Galaxy AI features would be available on Galaxy devices released in 2023. For now, the prior Galaxy S22 series from 2022 is left out, but that could change.</p><p>It seems that Samsung will start the One UI 6.1 rollout with the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus, and S23 Ultra devices. However, the company has confirmed that the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5, and Tab S9 series will get One UI 6.1 as well. Based on Samsung&apos;s system notification to users in China, the rollout will likely begin with the Galaxy S23 series and appear on other Galaxy devices from 2023 in the days and weeks to follow. </p><p>Owners of the Galaxy S23 series should be on the lookout for an update this week, although it isn&apos;t guaranteed. Users of the Galaxy S22 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">still have a glimmer of hope for getting Galaxy AI</a>, but that would be far out — if it even happens. </p>

<ul><li>Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, and Realme phones can now integrate their default gallery apps with Google Photos.</li><li>After connecting the photo apps, users can back up photos to Google Photos and view their Google Photos library in the default app. </li><li>OnePlus added this functionality as part of the OxygenOS 14 upgrade. However, the official requirements for the integration are an Android 11 phone or later from the above manufacturers. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Photos is a premier option for photo storage among Android users, but most OEMs include a default gallery app of their own. Now, if you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone</a> from Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, and Realme, you can link the default gallery app to Google Photos. After integrating the two apps, you&apos;ll be able to back up your on-device photos to Google Photos and view Google Photos media in your phone&apos;s default gallery app. </p><p>The new functionality is outlined in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/14216276?hl=en" target="_blank">Google support document</a> and was first spotted by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-photos-sync-xiaomi-oneplus/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>. Officially, Google says you only need a few things to link Google Photos to a default gallery app. First, only Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo, and Realme phones are supported. Then, the phones need to be running Android 11 or later with the latest version of the Google Photos app installed. However, each OEM might have different requirements for using Google Photos integration. </p><p>For example, OnePlus started supporting the feature with the release of OxygenOS 14, which is based on Android 14. OnePlus&apos; new flagships shipped with OxygenOS 14, and OnePlus Open users gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-open-android-14-oxygenos-update-united-states">widespread access to OxygenOS 14</a> starting this month. Both the OnePlus 12 series and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> should be able to link OnePlus&apos; default gallery app with Google Photos as a result. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Po2qMc643odhPV2Pi4Fzfk" name="Google Photos.jpg" alt="Google Photos on a Pixel 4a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Po2qMc643odhPV2Pi4Fzfk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start taking advantage of this integration, you might only have to respond to a pop-up in your phone&apos;s default gallery app. If asked to give the default app access to Google Photos, you can either choose <strong>Allow </strong>or <strong>Don&apos;t Allow</strong>. After that pop-up disappears, access can be granted in the settings menu of your phone&apos;s default gallery app. Under a tab called either "cloud sync" or "cloud backup," follow the on-screen prompts to grant Google Photos access.</p><p>Xiaomi has the most robust support for Google Photos integration with its gallery app. Xiaomi&apos;s gallery app and Google Photos can work together to provide a thorough two-way sync that includes album sharing. </p><p>To revoke Google Photos access, you can go to the same page in your phone&apos;s default gallery app. Alternatively, the gallery app will appear in the list of apps with Google Photos access in the Google Photos app, and the connection can be terminated there.</p><p>For now, this functionality is limited to the aforementioned four OEMs, but it could be extended to more brands in the future. </p>

<hr>
<p>Smartwatches are usually gauged by features like display, battery life, and fitness tracking functionality. Storage doesn&apos;t appear to be as important in a wearable as, say, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. But it&apos;s still a crucial spec that dictates how many apps, songs, and other things you can store for offline use. That&apos;s why Samsung is planning to double the amount of onboard storage offered on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, which is expected to launch this summer. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-7-three-variants-32gb-storage/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports that Samsung will offer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> in three different versions, confirming earlier rumors. What&apos;s new is that the Galaxy Watch 7 is now expected to include a storage upgrade. While the Galaxy Watch 6 was offered with 16GB of storage, this will reportedly be doubled to 32GB on this year&apos;s upcoming smartwatches. With smartwatches, plenty of the processing power and storage is offloaded to a paired smartphone, but there are still benefits to the extra storage.</p><p>For starters, Wear OS takes up a significant amount of a smartwatch&apos;s total available storage. If a device like the Galaxy Watch 6 includes 16GB of storage, only about 10GB of that will be usable space after the OS is installed. It&apos;s also important to consider that prior leaks have suggested that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-google-reportedly-testing-wear-os-5">Galaxy Watch 7 series will be powered by Wear OS 5</a>. The next version of Wear OS will all but certainly take up more space than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, further cutting into smartwatch storage. This could be part of the reason Samsung decided to bump the storage capacity of the Galaxy Watch 7 series to 32GB. </p><p>The increased capacity also benefits music lovers, as there will be more gigabytes available to store your favorite songs and albums. This comes in handy when you want to listen to music while offline, which helps with phone-free workouts. Although smartwatch apps are usually small in size, more storage means you can fit more apps on a Galaxy Watch. Plus, though they&apos;re virtually negligible in terms of storage usage, you can fit more watch faces with extra capacity. </p><p>Additionally, SamMobile claims that Samsung plans to alter the model number pattern of the Galaxy Watch 7 series. The report says that SM-L300 and SM-L305 represent one model, SM-L310 and SM-L315 account for another, and the premium model uses SM-L700 and SM-L705. SamMobile also suspects that the model numbers ending with "5" could signify support for cellular connectivity. This corroborates an earlier rumor that the Galaxy Watch 7 would come in three variants, with each version having a separate cellular option.</p><p>The exact release date of the Galaxy Watch 7 isn&apos;t known yet, but the Galaxy Watch 6 series debuted in August 2023. </p>

<ul><li>Vivo just unveiled its latest foldables in China, with the X Fold 3 and X Fold 3 Pro going on sale in the country shortly.</li><li>The X Fold 3 comes in at just 4.65mm when unfolded and weighs 219g, making it the thinnest foldable currently available.</li><li>The X Fold 3 Pro has a 5700mAh battery, and the X Fold 3 has a marginally smaller 5500mAh unit.</li><li>Both phones get considerable camera upgrades over last year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Vivo is doing all the right things in 2024; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> is a terrific showcase for the brand, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 series</a> combines a svelte design with standout cameras. The Chinese manufacturer is now turning its attention to the foldable segment once again, and the X Fold 3 series may just be its most ambitious effort yet.</p><p>There are two models in the series — the X Fold 3 and X Fold 3 Pro — and while both foldables have the same 6.53-inch outer panel and 8.03-inch inner panel, that where&apos;s the similarities end. You get 120Hz AMOLED screens on the inside and out, and the X Fold 3 has the distinction of being the thinnest foldable around thanks to its 4.65mm profile when unfolded. Coming in at 219g, it is the lightest as well.</p><p>The X Fold 3 is powered by last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and it has a trio of 50MP cameras at the back, with the main lens using a Sony IMX920 module. It gets IPX4 ingress protection, a lightweight hinge that&apos;s touted to be durable up to 500,000 unfolds, and a larger 5500mAh battery with 80W charging tech.</p><p>The X Fold 3 Pro is particularly noteworthy, with the foldable powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and featuring Vivo&apos;s custom V3 imaging module. It has an OmniVision 50MP main camera that&apos;s joined by a 50MP wide-angle lens and a 64MP telephoto lens with OIS.</p><p>But the key differentiator is that the X Fold 3 Pro features a huge 5700mAh battery, and it still somehow comes in at just 236g. To put things into context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> has a 4400mAh battery and weighs 253g, 17g more than the X Fold 3 Pro. And what I like is that the foldable has IPX8 ingress protection, the same level as what Samsung offers on its own foldables.</p><p>Clearly, Vivo is targeting the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor&apos;s Magic V2</a> with its latest foldables, and with both the X Fold 3 and X Fold 3 Pro now official in China, we&apos;ll have to wait and see when they&apos;ll make their global debut. Vivo hasn&apos;t detailed an international rollout just yet, but we should have more details over the coming weeks.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">latest Android 15 developer preview</a> contains some hints about an audio-sharing feature that will allow you to listen to the same audio on different compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a>.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/21/android-15-dp2-audio-sharing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Android 15 DP2 includes mentions of Bluetooth audio sharing tucked away in the <em>Connected devices</em> part of the Settings<em> </em>app. This isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen hints of this feature; it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-bluetooth-le-audio-stream-discovery">made a brief appearance in Android 14 QPR2 Beta 3 last month</a>, and it looks like it&apos;s starting to come together now.</p><p>This new feature in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> will make it easy for others to listen to your media with their own compatible headphones without needing to pair them to your phone first. Plus, there&apos;s a handy "Play a test sound" option to make sure all connected Bluetooth devices are synced up and ready to go.</p><p>There&apos;s also a "Stream settings" text visible underneath, but for now, it&apos;s not showing any content.</p>

<p>Currently, the <em>Share audio</em> feature isn&apos;t functioning in the newest Android 15 developer preview build. But it should be up and running in a future beta release. Keep in mind, though, that it&apos;ll probably only work with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">wireless earbuds that support Auracast</a>.</p><p>Auracast lets one device, like your phone or computer, send out audio to a bunch of headphones and speakers all at once. This Bluetooth technology has a ton of potential, from making group listening sessions easier to helping people with hearing issues.</p><p>What&apos;s neat about Bluetooth Auracast is that it doesn&apos;t need the usual pairing setup. This means you can have lots of streams happening simultaneously across multiple devices without any fuss. In theory, you can connect as many devices as you want, which makes it perfect for things like public broadcasts in waiting rooms, gyms, bars, airports—you name it.</p><p>Bluetooth Auracast has been out for a bit, but only a handful of products have it built-in. But that might change if it gets a big boost from being more integrated into Android 15.</p>

While there&apos;s a lot of excitement about official satellite connectivity, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-fold-tablet-persistent-taskbar-option-android-15-dp2">return of the old taskbar</a> for large-screen devices, and other features, one addition coming to Android 15 that I&apos;m excited about aims to give more flip phones the cover screen experience they deserve.</p><p>According to Google, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager#COMPAT_SMALL_COVER_SCREEN_OPT_IN">property</a> in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> will allow developers to declare that their app can be used on smaller displays like those used for cover screens on flip phones. Google says this must measure at least 1.5 inches for the shorter dimension and at least 2.4 inches for the longer dimension.</p><p>"These screens are too small to be considered as compatible targets for Android apps to run on, but your app can opt-in to supporting them, making your app available in more places," says Dave Burke, Google&apos;s VR of engineering. This means more flip phones should potentially be able to run full apps on their cover screens, a function that is fairly limited on most flippables outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, as I am, it&apos;s not hard to see why this is exciting for the immediate future of the form factor.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been using the Motorola Razr Plus as my daily driver ever since the phone launched in June 2023. There&apos;s a lot to like about the phone, but the biggest appeal for me is the fact that I can run almost any app on the large 3.6-inch cover screen. This means I can spend less time on the more power-hungry main display as I respond to texts, watch videos, and even play games without needing to open my phone. It&apos;s a great experience and one I hoped Samsung would lean into when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a> a month later. Unfortunately, that wasn&apos;t the case.</p><p>I&apos;ve written before about my disappointment with the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/choosing-between-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-motorola-razr-plus">why I chose to stick with the Motorola Razr Plus</a> despite Samsung&apos;s phone having a better chipset, better battery life, and better cameras. It&apos;s no secret to those who know me that I love One UI, and I would much rather be using the Z Flip 5 for that very reason. However, the cover screen experience is quite lacking, and the Razr Plus far surpasses other flip phones I&apos;ve used like the rather impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>. The Razr Plus may not be perfect, but this is the one thing that it gets right, and to me, it&apos;s the most important thing. It just works.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hMxyR4uRo4fdkm9iNY5wmJ" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-review-11.jpg" alt="App continuity button on the Razr+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMxyR4uRo4fdkm9iNY5wmJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Samsung makes users go through hoops to get apps working on the cover screen, and even then, the experience still feels lacking. Out of the box, there are only a handful of unofficially supported apps that you can access via the somewhat hidden Labs setting and have apparently been optimized for the cover screen.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions">if you want to use more apps</a>, you&apos;ll have to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>, install a module, enable a feature within that module, and then select which apps you want to appear. It&apos;s a bit much, and I&apos;ve had to explain this process to some friends who ended up buying the phone and had no idea this was possible.</p><p>Samsung has apparently worked with some developers to bring optimized versions of apps to the cover screen, which explains why the selection is pretty limited. Samsung has also suggested that more apps may be available in the future through Labs.</p><p>The problem is that Samsung is hindering its large cover screen by failing to really take advantage of it like Motorola is. It&apos;s not entirely clear why the company has opted to only allow select apps on the cover screen outside of trying to offer a so-called "curated" experience, but with this new capability in Android 15, Google is removing one potential barrier, and Samsung—and other OEMs—have an opportunity to give us the cover screen experience we deserve.</p><p>After all, while having apps optimized for the cover screen is nice, I would much prefer to have them available than not or avoid having to dig into apps and menus to make it happen. The optimization can happen later.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3885px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-OPPO-Find-N3-Flip-Motorola-Razr-Plus.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 5, Find N3 Flip, and Razr Plus side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNuJxZXfk4VcuazZJTzvbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3885" height="2185" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the Razr Plus is really the only flip phone I know that is taking full advantage of its cover screen this way. However, this new capability in Android 15 has the potential to open the floodgates for more OEMs to offer a similar experience. That&apos;s great for me as a lover of modern flip phones, but that also means Motorola would lose one of its main advantages over other devices.</p><p>After all, if I can get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or 7 with Android 15, a decent camera, and a better cover screen experience, then I&apos;m sold. Of course, app developers and OEMs like Samsung still have to opt-in to support the feature, but I can&apos;t imagine companies not wanting to when Google is practically handing it to them.</p><p>This change in Android 15 may also give us a glimpse into Google&apos;s plans for a potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-flip">Pixel Flip</a>. The company hasn&apos;t been forthcoming about its plans regarding a flip phone to follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>, but given how popular the form factor is compared to the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, it&apos;s likely Google is considering building one in the future. That said, if it does, I imagine Google will want to offer a similar cover screen experience to the Razr Plus and may even work with developers to further optimize apps for the smaller displays.</p><p>The global foldable market is growing, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/samsung-led-q423-foldable-market-huawei-expected-to-lead-in-q124-for-the-first-time">the latest numbers</a> show that Motorola is steadily catching up to Samsung, thanks to its new Razr models and stiffer competition in the space. However, it&apos;s only a matter of time before even more companies like Google and even OnePlus introduce their own flip phones, meaning Motorola will need to give me another reason to continue using the Razr if it wants to remain competitive.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>iQOO is reportedly already working on the successor of the iQOO Neo 9 Pro, despite the latter's recent release.</li><li>The upcoming smartphone is rumored to feature a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, similar to the one powering the flagship iQOO 12.</li><li>While the company hasn't confirmed plans for a new Neo-series phone, leaked details include display specs, camera features, and fast charging capabilities.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The iQOO Neo 9 Pro was only released last month, but a new leak suggests that the company is already working on the next-generation model with some crazy specs.</p><p>It looks like iQOO might be preparing a fresh smartphone to follow up on the iQOO Neo 9 Pro, which hit store shelves earlier this year. The scoop comes from Digital Chat Station over on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5014665757198623" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, and although they didn&apos;t spill the beans on the exact model, savvy commenters deduced that it&apos;s likely an iQOO phone, possibly joining the Neo 10 lineup (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/iqoo_neo10_pros_impressive_specs_leak-news-62127.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>As per the leaked information, this upcoming smartphone could pack a serious punch under the hood with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset</a>, the same processor that fuels the flagship model, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a>, and many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there.</p><p>Even though the company hasn&apos;t confirmed any plans for a new Neo-series phone yet, other juicy details about this rumored smartphone have found their way online, such as the display specs, camera details, and even hints about its fast charging capabilities.</p><p>According to DCS, the screen will be a 1.5K LTPO OLED flat display, boasting a max refresh rate of 144Hz.</p><p>DCS also claims there will be two cameras on board. One is rumored to be a 50MP with a sizeable sensor. Furthermore, expect blazing-fast 120W charging, paired with a "large battery" for all-day power. The phone could also include an X-axis motor for some impressive haptics.</p><p>Despite packing some seriously top-tier specs, rumor has it that this phone&apos;s frame might be plastic—definitely a curious choice. On the flip side, the back is said to come in either glass or faux leather, depending on your color preference.</p><p>As of now, the Vivo sub-brand is keeping mum about its next big release, especially since the Neo 9 Pro was just released last month. But some people are speculating that this new phone could be marketed as a "flagship killer" because, well, the choice of a plastic frame suggests they&apos;re aiming to keep costs down.</p>
