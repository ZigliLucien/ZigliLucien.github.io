It has a high-performance Snapdragon chip, a new 50MP wide-angle camera, and plenty of AI features to enhance your experience. But as with every new phone you buy, it&apos;s gonna take some setting up, and even after you move your data over and swap SIM cards, there are quite a few things you&apos;re gonna want to do to ensure you&apos;re getting the best possible experience.</p><p>As such, we&apos;re going to go through some of the first things you should do when you get your new Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-and-set-up-ai-features"><span>Enable and set up AI features</span></h2>
<p>One of the main highlight features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is Galaxy AI, with Samsung adding even more capabilities than it announced for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. Finding these features is pretty easy since they&apos;re largely connected in one option in the Settings menu. Simply open <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai"><strong>Galaxy AI</strong></a>. Here, you&apos;ll see a list of the available features on the Galaxy Z Flip 6:</p>
<ul><li>Call assist</li><li>Chat Assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note assist</li><li>Transcript assist</li><li>Browsing assist</li><li>Photo assist</li><li>Drawing assist</li><li>Photo ambient wallpaper</li><li>Health assist</li></ul>
<p>You&apos;ll want to dive into each of these options and enable the features you want. You can also select just about any one of them to download language packs that will be used across your Galaxy AI features. This will be very useful for translation or transcription features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.61%;"><img id="ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-AI-Menu-One-UI-6-1-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy AI menu on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ucFpMn466eNZayueswbcG4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3440" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Below all of these features, you&apos;ll find a toggle that will let the Galaxy Z Flip 6 <strong>Process data only on device</strong>. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>, none of what you do will be sent to the cloud for processing, which some users may prefer for privacy reasons. The downside of this is that it may limit the capabilities of some features, or you may not be able to use them.</p><p>Beyond Galaxy AI, you also have AI features from Google, such as Circle to Search. You can activate this specific feature by going to Settings > Display > Navigation bar and tapping the toggle for Circle to Search. You can also enable Magic Composer and Gemini in the Google Messages app, as well as additional photo editing features in Google Photos.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-and-customize-your-cover-screen"><span>Set up and customize your cover screen</span></h2>
<p>One of the best reasons to buy a flip phone is that you get to use the cover screen for various interactions. But before you do, we suggest setting up your cover screen just how you like it so you can prioritize the things that matter most.</p><p>On the Galaxy Z Flip 6, the easiest way to customize the cover screen is from the main display. Head over to <strong>Settings</strong> and navigate to <strong>Cover screen</strong>. From here, you can perform the following actions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Manage your cover screen wallpaper</strong>: Change to wallpaper to one of the preloaded options or add a new one, the latter of which gives you a large selection of customizable wallpaper options.</li><li><strong>Widgets</strong>: Manage which panels you want to appear on your cover screen. Many of these are first-party panels from Samsung, with the exception of Spotify.</li><li><strong>Notification options</strong>: Here, you can choose whether or not to show notifications, turn on the screen for incoming notifications, or set your <strong>Quick responses</strong> for certain notifications.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-27.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen widgets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BovQjnJgJY7s3aNj8dZx9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4134" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s also worth noting that you can add multiple widgets per panel. On your cover screen, press and hold the display and swipe all the way to the right. Press the <strong>+</strong> button to add a widget and select the first option, which should prompt you to open the phone. From there, you can select which widgets you want and the sizes you want them in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-ai-to-change-your-wallpapers"><span>Use AI to change your wallpapers</span></h2>
<p>Changing your phone&apos;s wallpaper is one of the easiest ways to personalize your device, but now companies are throwing AI into the mix. Samsung began letting users create Generative AI wallpapers with Android 14, and the company continues to expand the feature, which now works on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3362px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.36%;"><img id="EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ" name="Creating-Generative-AI-wallpaper-Samsung.jpg" alt="Creating a generative AI wallpaper on One UI 6.1.1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaEMKi4q7q57jTNpEpBZrJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3362" height="2601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We have an in-depth guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">creating a generative AI wallpaper</a> on your Android phone, and the feature works more or less the same between Samsung and Pixel devices. Press and hold the home screen, then select <strong>Wallpaper and style</strong>. Tap <strong>Change wallpapers</strong> and select <strong>Create with AI</strong>. From there, you can choose between generative wallpapers, where you input options in preset prompts, or you can create Photo ambient wallpapers for your lock screen, which changes your photo based on the time and weather.</p><p>Again, both options are now available for the cover screen, but you&apos;ll have to go to the <strong>Cover screen</strong> settings menu to change your wallpaper.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-good-lock-for-extra-customization"><span>Download Good Lock for extra customization</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Good-Lock.jpg" alt="Good Lock on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Good Lock is a very handy app for any Samsung Galaxy phone owner. It gives you tons of customization options, which can be a bit overwhelming, but after some fiddling around, you&apos;ll be able to drastically change the look and behavior of your phone.</p><p>You can download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> from the Galaxy Store or the Play Store. Once you do, open the app and select any of the modules to install. Be sure to read the descriptions so that you know what each module does. However, there&apos;s one particular module you&apos;ll definitely want to install, and we&apos;ll explain it in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-cover-screen-apps"><span>Set up cover screen apps</span></h2>
<p>Did you know you can use apps on the cover screen? Samsung does not promote this because it wants to focus on the curated widget experience, but it&apos;s possible, and there are two ways to do it. We have a dedicated guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">how to use apps on your Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a> that you should check out, but in a nutshell, there are two ways to do it.</p><p>First, you can access a select few apps to use on the cover screen through the <strong>Labs</strong> option in the <strong>Advanced features</strong> menu. Some popular ones are available, but unfortunately, they&apos;re very limited. Instead, you&apos;ll want to use Good Lock to have a much better experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.09%;"><img id="7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-how-to-set-up-cover-screen-widgets-with-good-lock-2.jpg" alt="How to set up cover screen widgets on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ugwRid4qwbd35v3pFfnMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2595" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You&apos;ll want to use the MultiStar module in the Good Lock app to enable the use of other apps you&apos;ve downloaded. This will give you a new Launcher widget that you can add to your cover screen, and you can even rearrange your apps just how you like them. Once you do, add the Launcher widget to your cover screen and arrange it where you want among your other panels. Again, you can access the guide linked above to learn more about how to enable this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now you have access to your apps from your cover screen, although there are some limitations to this method, as not everything is supported. Still, it&apos;s a good way to use your phone without opening it.</p>
<p>You can also use this same mode in vertical orientation by just setting the phone down and pointing it at your desired angle. This way, you can easily capture some social media videos for TikTok or Instagram.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-flex-mode-panel"><span>Set up the Flex mode panel</span></h2>
<p>One of the cool things about having a modern flip phone is the ability to fold it at an angle, which can make it easier to watch content if your hands are tied. Samsung takes this a step further by offering what&apos;s called a Flex mode panel, which adds various controls to the bottom half of the screen. Among those options are a giant touchpad, zoom slider, split screen toggle, quick settings button, screenshot button, settings button, and brightness and volume sliders. When content is playing on apps like Disney Plus or YouTube Music, it&apos;ll also present a timeline scrubber and rewind/fast-forward buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Flex-Mode-Panel.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex Mode Panel with Instagram running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muLAZxgnWdWVKXRtcCm2bH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can find this option by navigating to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Flex mode panel.</strong> When enabled, folding the phone at an angle while an app is open will present a small icon in the bottom left corner. When pressed, it will open the Flex mode panel. However, in the settings, you can have this appear automatically when you fold the phone at an angle, but you&apos;ll have to do this on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that some apps, like YouTube, provide their own custom layouts, so if you set the Flex mode to turn on automatically, it will override those layouts. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-easily-translate-conversations-in-person-or-on-apps"><span>Easily translate conversations in person or on apps</span></h2>
<p>The Interpreter app is probably one of the most useful in Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI arsenal. It makes it easy to communicate with people in person or over text, but there are ways to access either method. If you set up Galaxy AI in the earlier step, you may have noticed this as an option.</p><p>For in-person interactions, open the Interpreter app and set up the languages you&apos;re communicating with at the bottom of each section (or at the bottom of the screen if the phone is folded). On the top half is the other person&apos;s language, and the bottom half is yours. <strong>Tap the hamburger menu</strong> in the corner and the <strong>Settings icon</strong> to download more language packs, set up voice styles, and enable Tap to talk or Auto record when the mic is on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-translator-02.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 interpreter mode cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGU7huhRyzfaryLr6yTDce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The three options in the top right corner of the main screen are incredibly useful. The first lets you flip the top half so the other person can batter read the text on your phone without needing to be next to you. The second option lets you fold the phone in a 90-degree angle so text can be displayed on the cover screen. The final option will display your history.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-chat-assist-translation-german.jpg" alt="Using Chat Assist translation on the Galaxy S24 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNw5oY3PAHTRevVSPpGxUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3608" height="2030" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about text conversations? Samsung has that covered, too. You can check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist guide</a> for a more in-depth look at how to navigate Interpreter features when texting, but you will need to enable Samsung Keyboard for this to work.</p><p>Essentially, it will automatically translate whatever you is typed in a chat, and you can set the language on a per-chat basis if you communicate with people who speak different languages. It&apos;s pretty neat!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enhance-your-camera-experience"><span>Enhance your camera experience</span></h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 camera isn&apos;t bad, but it could be better. Its high dynamic range is lacking and can leave the sky overexposed in many photos. But fear not because Samsung has an app that can greatly improve things. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant</a> app is available to download in the Galaxy Store, and once installed, you can access it via the app icon or directly from your Camera settings, where you should see "Camera Assistant" as an option.</p><p>Once installed, I recommend enabling <strong>Auto HDR</strong>, which should improve the output of your photos. I also recommend turning on the <strong>2x crop zoom shortcut</strong> for an easy zooming option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RrTGtaA6PGkk7DzZRU4BhM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those are the main features I recommend, but there are plenty of options you should fiddle around with, such as the <strong>Quick tap shutter</strong> and <strong>Distortion correction</strong>. Take some time to go through the app to figure out what works for your imaging needs.</p><p>Also, there is one more thing you should do with the camera that isn&apos;t in the settings...</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fold-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-90-degrees-and"><span>Fold the Galaxy Z Flip 6 90-degrees, and...</span></h2>
<p>In the camera app, switch to video mode and fold the phone to a 90-degree angle. The phone will open into a "hidden" Auto Camcorder Mode, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>. You&apos;ll see that the viewfinder shrinks to the top-half of the phone with a minimal UI and standby/recording indicators. The bottom half where your hand will hold the phone, also simplifies the UI with a zoon slider, pause/stop button, shutter button, camera switch button, and flash toggle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.62%;"><img id="etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-camcorder-mode-UI.jpg" alt="The Auto Camcorder UI on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/etohDpg7oSj8yQBUiZU87N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2595" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This UI makes it easy to use the phone like a camcorder, and your thumb lets you easily zoom in and out while recording without having to really move your hand. It&apos;s a handy feature for recording, as it allows you to hold the phone steadily.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-better-safe-than-sorry-use-protection"><span>Better safe than sorry! Use protection</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="84SE9HjBxyDAdTu9WEYXE9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cases-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases from CASETiFY and UAG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84SE9HjBxyDAdTu9WEYXE9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3969" height="2232" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 costs $100 more than previous generations of the Flip series. Thus, that gives you more reason to protect your phone with accessories. Fortunately, we have a guide to help you pick out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cases">best Galaxy Z Flip 6 cases</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a> so you can worry less about your phone.</p><p>Keep in mind that the main display has a built-in screen protector, so your main concern is protecting the cover screen. While you can&apos;t <em>really</em> use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/do-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cases-fit-the-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 5 cases on the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, you can borrow screen protectors meant for the Z Flip 5 cover screen since they&apos;re the same size.

<p>Following months of leaks and teasers, the Pixel 9 series is finally official. For the first time ever, Google&apos;s smartphone lineup is comprised of four all-new devices, including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It&apos;s the company&apos;s second foldable, succeeding the Pixel Fold.</p><p>Starting at $1799, the latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a top-tier device that comes with powerhouse hardware, AI-enhanced software, and a plethora of other goodies. That&apos;s all well and good, but just how big of an upgrade it is over the previous-gen Pixel Fold?</p><p>Let&apos;s take a comparative look at the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold and find out how these foldables stack up against each other.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-design-displays-and-build-quality-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Design, displays, and build quality</h2>
<p>Having a completely refreshed design, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks (and feels) entirely different from its predecessor. While the Pixel Fold has a curved and polished frame, the newest model features flat sides with a satin finish. Not just that, but the front and the back are now fully flat glass surfaces as well. The reworked hinge is a huge improvement over what you&apos;d find on the Pixel Fold, as it allows the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to lay fully flat when it&apos;s unfolded.</p><p>The matte-finished back panel of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a welcome change over the glossy rear of the last-gen model. It&apos;s home to the foldable&apos;s triple-lens primary camera system, housed in a rectangular module — complete with rounded corners — placed on the top left corner. The lenses themselves sit in two pill-shaped cutouts that are stacked horizontally, with the LED flash and a microphone situated on their right. This design change helps give the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a unique visual identity, although there&apos;s no denying that Google&apos;s signature &apos;camera bar&apos; design — found on the Pixel Fold — will always remain iconic.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold sports a 6.3-inch &apos;Actua&apos; display that&apos;s much bigger than the 5.8-inch display of the Pixel Fold. Although both are incredible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-your-phone-display-work" target="_blank">OLED</a> panels having all the usual characteristics (e.g., 120Hz variable refresh rate, HDR support), what&apos;s interesting is the aspect ratio. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes with a 20:9 screen, which is a bit taller than the 17.4:9 screen of the Pixel Fold. And of course, it&apos;s not change for change&apos;s sake. The taller display — which is exactly the same as the one you&apos;d find on the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro — allows for an enhanced app experience.</p><p>Open up the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and you&apos;ll immediately notice that the inner screen has changed as well. The 8.0-inch &apos;Super Actua Flex&apos; display is a bit bigger than the 7.6-inch display of the Pixel Fold. Both are stunning folding OLED panels, but again, it&apos;s the aspect ratio that&apos;s particularly worth talking about. Compared to the 1.2:1 screen of the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a practically square 1.03:1 screen that should not only help minimize app compatibility issues, but also make multitasking a much better affair.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you get all the usual improvements (e.g., increased peak brightness, LTPO support for the inner screen) as well. Both smartphones are quite durable and come backed by an IPX8 rating. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 26g lighter than the Pixel Fold, despite having a larger physical footprint. It&apos;s also the thinnest foldable you can get in the United States, measuring just 5.1mm when unfolded.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hardware-and-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Hardware and cameras</h2>

<p>Google&apos;s latest foldable flagship brings quite a few upgrades when it comes to core hardware. Just like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">three slab-styled siblings</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is driven by the brand-new Tensor G4 SoC and comes with 16GB of RAM. In comparison, the Pixel Fold is powered by the now two-year old Tensor G2 chipset and comes with 12GB of RAM. Storage options remain unchanged, however, which means you have 256GB or 512GB to choose from.</p><p>Obviously, spec sheets aren&apos;t everything and we haven&apos;t had the chance to put the device through its paces yet. However, considering that Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found the Pixel Fold to be an admirable everyday performer in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, we&apos;re fairly certain the Pixel 9 Pro Fold won&apos;t disappoint us either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3V3p3G4grvbYfTxzeXAmgC" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-porcelain-camera-module-close.jpg" alt="Close-up on Porcelain Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3V3p3G4grvbYfTxzeXAmgC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Primary Camera System - Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a triple-lens primary camera system that, at least on paper, looks almost identical to that on the Pixel Fold. The primary sensor is still a 48MP unit with a 1/2-inch sensor size, and it&apos;s complemented by a 10.5MP ultrawide module and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The ultrawide sensor has a slightly lower resolution this time around, but the telephoto unit is the same. Also, the field of view has increased for both.</p><p>You get two additional cameras as well — one on the outside and one on the inside — with both having slightly improved resolution and better field of view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EhVauEN7xPKnmgrgyKEMs5" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-back-folded-camera-bar-black-01.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel Fold closed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhVauEN7xPKnmgrgyKEMs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Primary Camera System - Google Pixel Fold </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, we all know that when it comes to Pixels, it&apos;s Google&apos;s image processing that makes the real magic happen. As such, we&apos;re sure that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will end up among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera" target="_blank">best Android camera phones</a> (regardless of the form factor) out there, just like the Pixel Fold.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-software-and-ai-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Software and AI</h2>
<p>A minimal yet feature-laden software experience has always been the hallmark of Pixel smartphones, even more so when we&apos;re talking about a foldable. For its newest folding flagship, it seems Google has taken the already fantastic software of the previous-gen model and supercharged it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking-angled.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJM7X6EMRbZmf6ZLhdbBfa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold - Split-Screen Multitasking </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted by Android Central&apos;s Andrew Myrick during his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on" target="_blank">hands-on</a>, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a delight when it comes to multitasking. The reworked aspect ratio of the inner display allows two &apos;regular-sized&apos; apps to run in split-screen mode. You can pin the taskbar at the bottom, quickly launch multiple pairs of your frequently used apps side-by-side, and even have a third app running in a floating window.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-new-google-ai-features-claims" target="_blank">Google AI</a> is now a much more integral part of the device&apos;s overall user experience than it has ever been. You get a bunch of new apps (e.g., Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Studio) that leverage AI to enhance your workflow. Then there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, Google&apos;s built-in AI chatbot and Large Language Model (LLM) that can help you write stories from prompts, provide contextual information based on what&apos;s on your device&apos;s screen, and more.</p>

<p>Running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review" target="_blank">Android 14</a> out of the box, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is eligible for seven years of OS and security updates. Conversely, the Pixel Fold launched with Android 13 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-os-updates-will-the-pixel-fold-receive" target="_blank">is eligible</a> for five years of updates.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-should-you-upgrade-2">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Should you upgrade?</h2>
<p>The latest Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers just about everything one could possibly want from a modern foldable. You get a truckload of AI-powered software features, fantastic cameras, and two gorgeous displays that work equally well for multitasking and multimedia, all in a redesigned chassis that looks and feels every bit as premium as its price suggests.</p><p>On the other hand, the last-gen Pixel Fold still remains an extremely well-rounded foldable. It has a unique form factor, top-of-the-line cameras, and software features that continue to be unmatched. Moreover, since it&apos;s no longer the newest thing in town, buying one at a lower price shouldn&apos;t be that hard.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, these are two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best foldable phones</a> (at least in the high-end segment) you can get in the market right now. If you&apos;re planning to buy your first folding flagship, you should simply pick the one that better fits your budget.</p><p>However, if you already have the Pixel Fold, we recommend upgrading to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold only if you can get a great trade-in discount. Sure, the newer displays and fancy AI features are great, but they don&apos;t really seem worth shelling out $1,799 for, especially when you can save $400 get the awesome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Open</a> instead!</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive offers an early glimpse into Google's plans to integrate Pixel Screenshots in Circle to Search.</li><li>After highlighting an area, users can "save" a photo to Pixel Screenshots to return later and leverage Gemini's capabilities for rediscovery.</li><li>The Pixel Screenshots app debuted alongside several more Pixel 9 AI features like "Call Notes" and Gemini Live.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google may continue iterating on Circle to Search by implementing a recently debuted AI-based feature.</p><p>An APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-pixel-screenshots-integration-3472694/">Android Authority</a> shows that Google is reportedly working on integrating Pixel Screenshots into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. As shown in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/caqtKdNJlxU">the demo</a>, when highlighting a portion of your screen, users will find a new "Save" button in the options row above the selected area.</p><p>It seems Google will produce a splash screen when users tap that button for the first time. The company states that saving what&apos;s been circled will help you "remember what you find." It adds, "the highlighted section of your screen will be saved to screenshots." This is about Pixel Screenshots as attempting to view the photo throws you into the app — and the image in question.</p><p>Users can add a note about the screenshot or share it alongside information about when it was taken.</p><p>The integration was spotted in the Google app&apos;s latest beta version (15.32.37.29.arm64). There&apos;s no telling when this will roll out, despite how far along the development appears.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:227.27%;"><img id="bpWYVQxqkQALgiDVQUohGb" name="pixel-screenshots-circle-to-search-integration-spotted.jpg" alt="An APK dive shows that Google plans to integrate Pixel Screenshots into Circle to Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bpWYVQxqkQALgiDVQUohGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="264" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another aspect of this integration is the text box beneath a saved screenshot from Circle to Search that states "Processing Paused." It explains that the screenshot taken is not "AI enabled" and informs the user that they must do so in their settings to leverage Gemini&apos;s intelligence.</p><p>This is where the rediscovery side of Pixel Screenshot&apos;s implementation into Circle to Search comes into play.</p><p>Following the Pixel 9, one exciting feature was Pixel Screenshots and how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on#:~:text=Google%20is%20overhauling%20how%20screenshots%20work%20on%20the%20Pixel%209">Google is increasing the usefulness</a> of such pictures. Aside from automatic organization, the feature leverages Gemini&apos;s AI to process and understand the available information in a photo. Additionally, users can inquire about something specific to Gemini in the screenshot to help.</p><p>In other cases, the app will recognize where a screenshot was snapped (like Google Maps) and ask the user if they&apos;d like to research it.</p><p>This was one of a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Pixel 9 exclusive Gemini features</a> that Google detailed during its event last week. Gemini Live was the other side of things; a conversational variant of the model that helps users understand a host of topics. Gemini&apos;s new overlay brings text-to-image generation to more places like Messages and Gmail.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra were spotted picking up certification in China's 3C database.</li><li>The tablets reportedly feature 45W wired fast charging, which has become a common trend for Samsung.</li><li>The Tab S10 series was previously rumored to only feature the Plus and Ultra editions as Samsung supposedly places more interest in larger screens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s next-generation of Galaxy tablets are on the way and it seems they&apos;ve made the usual certification appearance.</p><p>We&apos;re missing the Galaxy Tab S10 series, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/tablets/tablets-news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-tab-s10-ultra-3c/">MySmartPrice</a> states the devices have now appeared in China&apos;s 3C Certification database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-tab-s10-fast-charging-speed-leak/">SamMobile</a>). Only two devices were seen listed: the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (SM-X820) and the Tab S10 Ultra (SM-X926C). According to the database, Samsung will debut the devices with 45W (wired) fast charging.</p><p>Unfortunately, the database doesn&apos;t offer any insight into the potential battery capacities of the devices in question.</p><p>The publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/tablets/tablets-news/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-plus-bis-certification/">reiterated a previous rumor</a>, which stated the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus may arrive with cellular and Wi-Fi connection. If true, it wouldn&apos;t be anything new. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus</a> also featured 5G connection capabilities alongside the expected Wi-Fi connection in 2023.</p><p>However, that BIS certification appearance said nothing about the Ultra model — similar to last year when the Plus model was solo with 5G.</p>

<p>With the Galaxy Tab S10 series appearing for certification, it seems consumers are in for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">more of the same</a>. The Tab S9 Plus and Tab S9 Ultra launched with the same 45W wired charging speeds. This has been a common trend for Samsung as even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-vs-tab-s7-plus">the Tab S7 Plus</a> offered it. Even the battery capacity of the Plus has remained consistent at 10,090mAh.</p><p>The Tab S9 Ultra features an 11,200mAh battery. It remains to be seen if Samsung offers any upgrades in that department.</p><p>In other news, rumors state Samsung is ditching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">smaller base Tab model</a> in favor of its two larger editions. Sources claimed in July that the company is more interested in offering tablets of a larger display size.</p><p>Supposedly, Samsung is eyeing a starting AMOLED panel size of 12 inches, with the potential to go higher. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-renders-leak">Renders of the Ultra model</a> were spotted with a design similar to the Tab S9 version with a 14.6-inch display.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-mediatek-featured-globally">is also rumored</a> to side with MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9300 Plus SoC instead of Qualcomm this year. Additionally, with the tablets missing from Unpacked in July, speculation states Samsung might launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">them in October</a>. That launch could feature the supposed Tab S10 duo <em>and </em>the Galaxy S24 FE.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Gemini AI on Android is getting a stylish makeover with a floating panel that features a sleek glowing animation.</li><li>The new panel’s glow is eye-catching but doesn’t dominate your screen, and instead smartly integrates with your current app.</li><li>The update also introduces a new “Ask about this video” chip on YouTube, replacing the old prompt.</li></ul>

<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> assistant is getting a sleek new look on Android, featuring a floating panel with a glowing animation.</p><p>The new interface on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is rolling out now, featuring a glowing animation that lights up around the panel when Gemini is summoned, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/17/gemini-glow-floating-overlay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The animation looks fantastic and doesn’t crowd your screen. It offers a smart overlay that knows what you’re doing in the background, letting Gemini work seamlessly with your current app instead of taking over your entire screen.</p><p>First shown at Google’s developer conference in May, this panel is designed to help you keep working smoothly while giving you useful information from the AI assistant.</p><p>If you want a more immersive experience, just tap the upper-right corner of the overlay to expand it to full screen. Plus, the panel works smoothly with Gemini’s image generation features, letting you drag and drop images right into Gmail or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>.</p>

<p>The update also brings a new "Ask about this video" chip for YouTube videos, replacing the old "Ask about this screen" prompt. This upgrade lets users easily get summaries or ask questions about video content, making it super handy for educational videos and cutting down on note-taking and comprehension work.</p><p>In summary, the new Gemini features for Android are a big upgrade. The floating panel, in particular, is a smart addition that enhances the user experience, making it easy to use Gemini while on the go.</p><p>This update comes right after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">launch of Google’s Gemini Live</a>, which rolled out a more natural, chat-like interface for talking to the chatbot.</p><p>While the new Gemini overlay offers a smoother user experience, it doesn’t match the advanced conversational features of Gemini Live. The good news is, unlike Gemini Live—which needs a Gemini Advanced subscription—the overlay is available to all Gemini users.</p><p>Right now, these new features are available to just a few users. But Google plans to roll them out to a wider audience in the coming weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out Pixel Camera version 9.5.118, which brings manual Astrophotography activation to users.</li><li>After updating, users can find the mode in Night Sight's duration slider without waiting for their device to produce it automatically.</li><li>The company also started rolling out "Zoom Enhance" to the Pixel 8 Pro last week alongside details of its availability on the Pixel 9 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out a Pixel Camera update that gives users reliable control over a unique nighttime setting.</p><p>As Google News (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4208">Telegram</a>) spotted, the company is pushing a Pixel Camera update marked as version 9.5.118 for manual Astrophotography (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/enable-astrophotography-mode-manually-pixel-phone/">Android Police</a>). The feature has previously played off the Pixel&apos;s "Night Sight" camera mode, which is where Google has placed its manual control.</p><p>The post suggests that users should notice a pop-up in the Pixel Camera app when switching to Night Sight <em>after </em>updating. The company has included a new crescent moon icon to represent Astrophotography within Night Sight&apos;s duration slider. </p><p>Tapping the shutter button will produce a five-second timer and it&apos;s encouraged that users remain still to capture the best quality photo. However, the post adds that users can turn this timer off if they&apos;re already stable and want to take pictures without delay.</p><p>The publication states that capturing and processing Astrophotography mode content may take longer "depending on your Pixel&apos;s age." So, it&apos;s likely that the newly announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> has the quickest draw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:729px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.30%;"><img id="han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn" name="pixel-camera-manual-astrophotography-update.jpg" alt="Google is pushing an update for the Pixel Camera that brings manual Astrophotography control." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/han2ahzUEY7vFHd9rXJqyn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="729" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google News / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has started rolling this update out to Pixel devices, but it doesn&apos;t seem widespread yet. More devices should see it as the week progresses. For the daring, the publication states you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/camera/camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-release/pixel-camera-9-5-118-660615940-21-android-apk-download/">manually sideload the update</a> through APKMirror.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography mode</a> has been a good way for interested parties to capture low-light or night shots, though its preference for the "perfect scenario" could hitch you up. It&apos;s always been activated through Night Sight; however, users were previously required to keep their devices still. The mode was automatic, meaning users (ideally) needed a tripod to meet the feature&apos;s demands and let it activate.</p><p>Moreover, users can hop into the <strong>camera app > Go to Night Sight > Settings </strong>to tinker with those shutter timer settings. Google&apos;s advanced settings for the mode include resolution sizes, a time-lapse option, and if you&apos;d like to shoot in JPEG or RAW.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google started rolling out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-zoom-enhance-pixel-8-pro-pixel-9-rollout">Zoom Enhance</a>" for the Pixel 8 Pro with details about the feature&apos;s release on the Pixel 9. The feature leverages its AI software to "intelligently" fill in those gaps and faults when zooming into a photo to keep its high quality. This was a feature Google teased in 2023 and it seems its longer-than-expected development holds a slight drawback.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">opened up its ImageFX tool</a> to the general public with revamped safeguards and restrictions. The AI image generation tool has been available in a limited capacity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-imagen-2-vertex-ai-debut">for a while</a> and has had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-gemini-ai-image-generation-faults">its share of controversy</a>. Now everyone can see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>And you should. Especially if you&apos;ve never used this type of tool before.</p><p>AI is the buzzword of the year but there are real tools out there that are using it effectively. Trying to ignore it may be understandable, but sometimes it&apos;s worthwhile to face a thing head-on and see what it&apos;s really about.</p><p>There are plenty of AI tools that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">do the same thing</a>, and some of them might be better at it than Google&apos;s. It&apos;s not like this is anything new or groundbreaking. I&apos;m not suggesting you try it out because it&apos;s something different.</p>
<p>It is something <em>really</em> cool, though. How these things work is you tell it what type of image to create, submit your idea, and wait for a bit. 10-30 seconds later (Imagen 3 is pretty fast) it tosses out a sample image or two. This is how most of these tools work.</p><p>What makes Google&apos;s offering different is that you already have a login to use it and, as of now, there&apos;s no sort of waiting list or charges involved. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx">Visit Google&apos;s AI Test Kitchen website</a>, sign into the Google account you already have, and start telling ImageFX to make art. It works on both a computer and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a> so it&apos;s easy to use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1246px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.31%;"><img id="3chHGczqNthZ2gjS78sejN" name="ImageFX.png" alt="Google ImageFX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3chHGczqNthZ2gjS78sejN.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1246" height="602" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s fun. And if you&apos;ve never used this type of tool, it&apos;s pretty amazing. Google has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Imagen-Team-Google">set of rules</a> about what images can be created and if you get too wild you might get a message that denies your request. Even so, Google does warn you that "AI outputs may sometimes be offensive or inaccurate" because they can. AI is often easy to fool.</p>
<p>There&apos;s another good reason to check out a tool like ImageFX. In 2024, especially since it&apos;s an election year, you&apos;re going to be inundated with fake AI-generated images. You&apos;re also going to see false claims that images were generated by AI. It is the nature of the beast.</p><p>The best way to better understand what can and can&apos;t be done using AI is to play with it yourself. It&apos;s shockingly easy to create a potentially embarrassing or compromising image of anyone using AI tools and you&apos;ve seen at least one. You might not have known it was AI-generated.</p>
<p>Becoming familiar with AI image-generating tools is the best way to understand and try to discern if a "photo" is the real deal or a fake. Since not every company&apos;s offering has the types of restrictions Google does when it comes to acceptable use some of this stuff can cause harm.</p><p>While professionals and pro-level tools for AI imagery exist, tools like ImageFX make it easy for everyone to try their hand at it. And a lot of people are doing it. Spending some time having fun and becoming familiar with tools like this can help you sort the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<ul><li>A Google representative has shared some exciting details on what's coming to Chromecast with Google TV.</li><li>The streaming device's older 4K and HD models will eventually get Android 14, though some new features available on the Google TV Streamer might be absent.</li><li>While the timeline still needs to be determined, it is a major update from the current Android 12 version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently stepped up its streaming game with the new Google TV Streamer, replacing Chromecast. But that doesn’t mean the company is ignoring updates for older Chromecast devices.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-android-14-3472136/">Android Authority</a>, the Chromecast with Google TV will receive the Android 14 update, even though it’s been discontinued. The publication received this affirmation from a Google product manager at the Made by Google event last week, where the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, and the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on">Pixel Watch 3</a> were also showcased.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YqvofrXuNURUshdjSfRpX4" name="hazel-remote-google-tv-streamer-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Hazel Google TV Streamer remote lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YqvofrXuNURUshdjSfRpX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest development comes after the recent launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>, which runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, making it the first TV device to do so. However, it&apos;s important to note that older Chromecast models won’t get all the new software features available on the TV Streamer.</p><p>According to the publication, one feature of the Google TV Streamer that won’t be available on older Chromecast devices, even with the Android 14 update, is the ability to connect to the Thread border router. This tech lets you quickly and securely link smart home devices like locks and motion sensors.</p>
<p>The Android 14 for TV upgrade marks the second major upgrade for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-google-tv-review">Chromecast with Google TV (4K)</a> when it eventually rolls out as it shipped with Android 10 and later got Android 12. </p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">HD version</a> launched later and shipped with Android 12. Besides, the 4K model is set to get security updates until September 2025, while the HD model will receive updates until September 2027.</p><p>While Android Authority has learned that Chromecast with Google TV will indeed receive the Android 14 update, it’s still unclear when exactly it will arrive. Hopefully, it’ll be sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Can I use an Android phone without signing into a Google account? Does everything work?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey, there anon! That&apos;s a great question that I&apos;ve seen people ask from time to time because whenever you turn on a new (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">new to you</a>) phone the first thing you&apos;ll see is a tech company asking you to sign in. Apple and Google do this, and if you bought a phone from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">a company like Samsung</a>, it too may ask you to create or log into an account.</p><p>The good news is that you don&apos;t have to do any of it. But you might want to anyway.</p>
<p>I like to give a concise answer at the beginning of an article for people who want quick info, so as mentioned above no you <strong>do not have to sign into a Google account to use an Android phone</strong>. Not everything is going to work as expected though, including some really important features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PVU2GQWBiotMUnrPj3KbfS" name="google-find-my-device-app-on-oneplus-12r-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device app on a OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PVU2GQWBiotMUnrPj3KbfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any app or service from Google is, of course, not going to work properly without access to a Google account. Chrome, for example, will browse the web just fine but you won&apos;t have any syncing tools for access to saved bookmarks or across devices.</p><p>Other apps like Google Calendar or Google&apos;s Contacts app won&apos;t work at all because they depend on information sorted in the cloud under a Google account. The most important feature that isn&apos;t going to work correctly is the tool used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">find a lost phone</a>. It requires you to sign into the same account as used on the phone to work to "prove" that you are the actual owner. Without access, you can&apos;t locate — or more importantly — lock and erase — a lost or stolen phone.</p>
<p>The same goes for things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-download-and-update-galaxy-apps-samsung-store">Samsung&apos;s apps</a>. You need a Samsung account to properly use them, just like you need a Microsoft or Apple account to use their services. </p><p>The good news is that the basics will work just fine. You can use the phone for calling and texting, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources">apps can be installed</a> and used as long as they don&apos;t need any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google&apos;s underlying services</a>, and millions of people use phones like this every day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7" name="Google-Play-Store-home-page.jpg" alt="Google Play Store home page on Android and Chrome OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AhaX4oiMTLreQSzTcsAWn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2293" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most people, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. I can understand if you&apos;re not keen on sharing your personal life with a faceless giant tech company, but I suggest you read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google&apos;s terms of service</a> and understand the privacy and data deletion tools at your disposal before you make any decisions.</p><p>Besides, it&apos;s easy to make a "fake" Google account and manage it in a way that most of the data isn&apos;t really about you.</p>

I was hoping that the tablet would answer one of Google’s biggest issues: a cohesive and unified smart home strategy. </p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Off the Record</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B6hq8h3CPcPnREiyx6XWUN" name="shruti-lloyd-bow-with-desk.jpg" caption="" alt="Off the Record.

<p>Many people had high hopes for the tablet being the device that integrated all of Google’s smart home products into one cohesive and versatile unit. However, the device functions more or less like a regular tablet with a dock and some smart home features tacked on. To top it off, the experience doesn’t lead it to be the Nest Hub replacement many had hoped for. </p><p>So when Google didn’t announce a new tablet iteration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">during its Pixel event</a>, I wondered if it was either because the company was taking its time by trying to combine its smart home strategy with its new Gemini efforts or if the tablet was maybe just a one-off effort.</p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-gemini-and-flagship-phones-xa0-2">Focusing on Gemini and flagship phones </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-01.jpg" alt="Talking to Gemini Live on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bCUGcKHwkrXYYYUozT6G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s evident that Google wanted to focus on its Android software and the integration of Gemini with its latest lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9 devices</a>. Before even announcing its devices, Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of platforms & devices at Google, began his presentation by explaining how the company has integrated Gemini into its operating system. </p><p>Osterloh announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-android-gemini-updates-detailed">Gemini Live will let users engage</a> in a “mobile conversational experience” to discuss “whatever’s on your mind.” The company also detailed how users can now overlay Gemini’s UI on top of any app and that this new feature will work for videos on YouTube, which lets users ask questions about what they’re watching. </p><p>It’s obvious that Google cares a lot more about its software than its hardware. In fact, I’d argue that Google’s hardware has been chiefly designed and created as a base point for its hardware and for other Android-based companies to model off of.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here’s why I think the company didn’t launch a Pixel Tablet 2: Right now, it doesn’t really care about a large-screen tablet and wants to focus on perfecting its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> strategy. By solidifying this, it will then be able to reinvent its smart home strategy around the experience, which should be integrated with Gemini, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-to-become-smarter-with-gemini-help">we’ve already started seeing with Google Home</a>.</p><p>Gerrit Schneemann, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, added that launching Gemini Live and integrating it with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new Nest Thermostat</a> was key and, in my opinion, likely the first thing the company needed to do to kick off this strategy. However, he adds that instead of a mobile hub, perhaps having a dedicated smart home device to combine all of Google’s smart home devices is necessary; an app could be enough. </p><p>“Especially with Gemini Live, voice becomes an even more prominent part of the user experience. And again, having a duplicate mobile screen in the home along with smartphones, doesn’t seem to add much to the value proposition,” he said. “A tablet that moves around maybe amongst users as well could easily not be where it is needed most (kitchen, side table, etc.) because someone removed it.”</p>
<h2 id="do-we-even-need-a-pixel-tablet-xa0-2">Do we even need a Pixel Tablet? </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF" name="google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max next to Pixel Tablet on countertop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bi7MhZGQa4eW7r5ZWBEvcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Schneemann makes a very valid point: Why would someone want to keep moving their main hub around? And the more I think about it, the more I ask myself: Does Google even need a tablet to double as a dedicated point of service for all of your smart home devices?</p><p>At the time of writing this article, all of my smart home devices are on Google. We have a thermostat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-wifi-pro-review-honestly-its-a-bit-disappointing">Nest Wi-Fi</a> system, doorbell, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-assistant-speakers">speakers</a>. Everyone in my household uses the dedicated Google Home app to control everything. </p><p>For some reason, when I got the Pixel Tablet last year, I pictured myself using it similarly to how I used the Nest Hub Max, but in almost a more futuristic way. At the end of the night, I pictured myself taking the tablet to the bedroom, shutting things down, fixing the temperature of the home, and settling into bed. That was far from the case. </p><p>Instead, the tablet replaced our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Nest Hub Max</a> and was barely touched. I used it as a speaker occasionally while I cooked. However, I didn’t think the connection to the tablet was that great, and every time I tried to set a timer, it never worked. It came to a point where I was considering switching back to the Hub Max.</p><p>In his comparison piece, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Tshaka Armstrong also points out</a> similar limitations to the Pixel Tablet’s Hub mode that seemingly fall short of the five-year-old Nest Hub Max. He also notes that his family isn’t big on tablets and that the Pixel Tablet will often be used to watch the occasional show in bed, although even this comes secondary to just using an actual TV. </p><p>However, that’s not to say there aren’t some who find the Pixel Tablet genuinely helpful. As noted by Armstrong, “the [Nest Hub] Max is going to be a stationary device, while you’re going to get so much more flexibility, and ultimately usability, out of the Pixel Tablet,” even if it takes time for Google to improve the experience.</p>
<h2 id="xa0-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-the-new-tablet-xa0-2"> The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the new Tablet </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-window.jpg" alt="Gemini window prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUKPM7ujJtYLrUqaRYPByE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I would argue this further by adding that perhaps Google may not even continue launching tablets because it has designed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> device to act more like the tablet you need. </p><p>Schneemann notes that with the larger 8-inch internal display, the company is basically reaching tablet size. </p><p>“Of course, this is a super-premium device with limited global availability. It’s even less likely to be a dedicated [smart home] device. But it shows that Google is thinking about the larger screen form factor — just hasn’t found the right positioning for its tablets after years of underdevelopment in the platform.” </p><p>There&apos;s also another side of that argument: is there even a market for tablets right now? </p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&apos;s Worldwide Device Trackers, says that the current model of the Tablet isn’t a bestseller and “demand for traditional tablets ahs been wanning for some time.”</p><p>“While it would be great to align the launch of a new tablet with their other devices, tablets are often one of the least used compute devices for consumers and their refresh cycle has been growing, making them a lower priority for both consumers and device makers.”</p>
<h2 id="it-x2019-s-time-for-a-nest-revamp-xa0-2">It’s time for a Nest revamp </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb" name="google-nest-learning-thermostat-gen-4-06.jpg" alt="The shiny Google Nest Learning Thermostat (Gen 4)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsxSwZiBnHnu9SoXgsVkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, while a tablet may not be exactly necessary, I still think Google needs to develop a much more unified smart home strategy, and we definitely need new Nest hardware.</p><p>Of course, I asked our senior editor and resident tablet expert—as well as smart home aficionado—Andrew Myrick, his thoughts. He told me that it was odd to see Google announce an unprecedented number of devices within a two-week span and even more confusing that it’s been years since the Nest Hub has been refreshed. </p><p>He thinks this either means that we are in store for an overhauled Nest lineup sometime in the near future and that the company is “likely using the Pixel Tablet and dock design as the centerpiece.”</p><p>“Or Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/you-should-buy-google-pixel-tablet">abandoning the Tablet again</a>, and we’ll only see remedial improvements to its smart home speakers,” he said. However, like my own assumption, Myrick also believes that none of this will happen until Google has further advanced Gemini. </p><p>I love Google’s smart home devices. They’ve never failed me and have brought a lot of seamless integration into my home. However, I would love a better strategy here, one that is a bit more elevated, includes more of Gemini, and maybe has a single point-of-service hardware device akin to the Nest Hub Max, but with the kind of upgrades we’d expect in 2024.</p>
