<ul><li>In a move that will make Google Chat more like competitors Slack and WhatsApp, Google is planning to add support for broadcast messaging. </li><li>The new feature, called "Announcements," will presumably allow users to pick and choose who can send messages in large groups.</li><li>It appears to be similar to Channels on WhatsApp, and could make Google Chat a more feasible option for workplace communication. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Broadcast messaging is becoming an increasingly popular way to connect with a large number of users without groups turning into a frenzy. Social media features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-twitter-video-option-spaces-rollout">X (formerly Twitter) Spaces</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-channels-gain-new-features">WhatsApp Channels</a> limit who can speak or chat while allowing select users to communicate with a massive audience. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">Google Chat</a> appears to be taking note of these successful features and is preparing one of its own. It&apos;s called "Announcements," and it will make broadcast messaging possible on the platform.</p><p>Longtime Android dissector <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1773706508293091413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1773706508293091413%7Ctwgr%5E9560aac26c6408abeb348856bd54fd0e10101a2d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fgoogle-chat-steal-whatsapp-announcement-channels-feature%2F" target="_blank">AssembleDebug on X</a> gave us our first look at the Announcements feature in Google Chat (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-chat-steal-whatsapp-announcement-channels-feature/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). We don&apos;t know exactly how Announcements will work yet, but we have a good idea. Right now, there is only one type of Google Chat space, and it allows for collaborative groups. With this new feature, Google Chat users will be able to choose whether their space is for collaboration or announcements. </p><p>Collaboration spaces allow Google Chat users to "collaborate on project, plans, or topics [and] easily share files, assign tasks, and organize your conversations by threads." By comparison, the new Announcements spaces will make it possible for Google Chat users to "broadcast and share updates with your group. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Chat is working on a new "Announcements" feature which will allow you to "Broadcast and share updates with your groups"There isn't much info about it yet.#GappsLeaks #Android pic.twitter.com/gW8leE24kq<a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1773706508293091413">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The new Announcements feature will almost certainly make it possible to limit who can post in a Google Chat space. What&apos;s unclear is whether more than one person can make announcements in an Announcements space or if it&apos;ll be limited to just the creator. Assuming that Google wants to make Google Chat an alternative to current broadcast messaging platforms, it&apos;ll need that level of curation. </p><p>There are a handful of apps and services that Google could be trying to beat with the Announcements feature in Google Chat. Consumer-level apps like WhatsApp, Discord, and Telegram all have similar functionality to Google Chat spaces. Additionally, there are workplace-grade apps such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. Considering that Google has plenty of business-oriented apps in Google Workspace, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising for the company to want to bring everything under one roof.</p><p>Still, we&apos;ll have to wait and see what Google Chat Announcements are really like when they debut and whether people want to use them. </p>

<ul><li>POCO's next release, the POCO F6, is rumored to include the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC, positioning it as a strong competitor among Android phones this year.</li><li>Xiaomi's confirmation of a device powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC aligns with rumors suggesting it will be the POCO F6, offering flagship-like performance at a lower cost.</li><li>Camera details for the POCO F6 hint at a 50MP Sony sensor for the main camera and an 8MP Sony ultra-wide lens.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak has shed light on the specs of POCO&apos;s next flagship model, boasting a mighty processor, and it&apos;s shaping up to be a solid contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a> this year.</p><p>POCO is presumably getting ready to roll out its next F-series phone, the POCO F6. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/03/17/redmi-note-13-turbo-poco-f6-may-feature-the-new-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-chip/" target="_blank">Rumor</a> has it that this device might also debut as a new Redmi Note model, possibly called the Redmi Note 13 Turbo in China.</p><p>Xiaomi previously confirmed that it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">release a device powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC</a>, and a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/03/poco-f6-camera-processor-specs-leak" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> suggests this model is the POCO F6.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 might not match the raw power of the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, but it&apos;s pretty close and comes at a lower cost for OEMs. Considering POCO&apos;s strong emphasis on budget-friendly options, this choice shouldn&apos;t come as a big surprise.</p><p>The Xiaomi Civi 4 Pro is the first smartphone to feature the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, hitting store shelves in China not too long ago. POCO&apos;s global executive David Liu recently shared via a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/DavidBlueLS/status/1770705943057068190" target="_blank">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that a global edition of the Civi 4 Pro will also pack the same processor. This adds weight to the latest rumor about the processor for the upcoming POCO F6.</p><p>This won&apos;t be POCO&apos;s first rodeo with slapping a top-tier processor onto its phones. The Chinese brand has a history of equipping its phones with top-tier chipsets, as seen with the POCO F5 Pro&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1, while the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f5-and-f5-pro-announcementhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f5-review">POCO F5</a> had the Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 2.</p><p>However, it&apos;s still up in the air whether we&apos;ll see a Pro edition of the POCO F6 series running on the beefier Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</p><p>Turning our attention to the rear of the phone, the main camera is said to sport a 50MP Sony sensor, accompanied by an 8MP Sony ultra-wide lens. There&apos;s talk of a third camera, similar to the macro lens in the Poco F5, but details on that for the F6 are still under wraps.</p><p>The global launch of the POCO F6 is expected to take place in April or May, following the introduction of its Redmi counterpart in China, expected in early April.</p>

<ul><li>In a recent Reddit AMA, one of Google's product managers for Google Home and Nest confirmed that the company is still trying to support old Nest cameras in Google Home.</li><li>Google cited the difficulties of supporting devices that were released as far back as 2015 with new software.</li><li>Still, the product manager said that Google is committed to adding support for these older cameras. </li></ul>

<p>Itching for your older Nest cameras to be supported in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-2023-availability">Google Home app</a>? While there&apos;s still time to wait, you can rest assured that Google is working on supporting Nest cameras in Google Home. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-team-ama-reddit-recap">recent AMA on Reddit</a>, members of the Google Home and Nest software team answered a variety of questions directly from users. At least a few users asked about older Nest cameras getting software support, and Google responded. </p><p>"On it – we&apos;re working on bringing support for older generation Nest cameras to the Google Home app," said one of Google&apos;s product managers for Google Home and Nest, identified as Emily. "Stay tuned!"</p><p>That doesn&apos;t give us anything as far as a timeline for support, but it may be helpful for Nest users to know that support is still in the works. Right now, if you use a blend of Google Home and Nest products, your devices may be split between the Google Home and Nest apps. This isn&apos;t a great user experience, but it&apos;s something that Google is actively trying to fix. </p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1bpxro1/comment/kx01ddc">Comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The product manager noted the difficulties that come with supporting Nest cameras that may be nearly a decade old. The first Nest Cam was revealed in June 2015, followed by the Nest Cam Outdoor in July 2016. </p><p>"Updating firmware and software of older devices - some of which were launched back in 2015 - is a significant technical challenge that we’re committed to doing," Emily wrote.</p><p>However, some of these older cameras already work in the Google Home app. Last year, Google added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/new-google-home-app-nest-cam-indoor">support for the Nest Cam Indoor and Nest Cam Outdoor</a> in Google Home. Users could port their cameras from the Nest app to the Google Home app with relative easy, and go back to Nest if they didn&apos;t like the new experience. Select older Nest cameras were still unsupported, though. </p><p>The comments from Google&apos;s product manager are interesting because the company has already overcome the hurdle of supporting its oldest cameras. The camera from 2015 referenced in the Reddit comment is the Nest Cam Indoor, which is supported in Google Home. The Nest Cam Outdoor, the company&apos;s second-oldest camera, is supported as well. </p><p>Newer cameras, like the Nest Cam IQ from 2017 and the Nest Hello Doorbell from 2018, are the ones that remain unsupported. </p><p>Aside from a few exceptions, Google&apos;s long-term goal is to support all Nest products with Google Home. While the process is moving somewhat slowly, Google has reiterated that it is still ongoing. </p>

<ul><li>Motorola has an Ultra model in the pipeline in its Edge 50 series.</li><li>The renders and some marketing teasers of the Edge 50 Ultra have leaked.</li><li>The launch of the device is expected alongside the Edge 50 Pro and the Edge 50 Fusion in April.</li><li>The device is expected to be powered with the latest Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola is gearing up for its Edge 50 series launch in multiple regions in the early first week of April. The Ultra model has shown up online through a couple of leaks ahead of the launch.</p><p>The upcoming Edge 50 series will likely have at least three models in the lot, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-launching-on-april-3-2024">Motorola Edge 50 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-fusion-launch-april-3-2024">Edge 50 Fusion</a> models already appearing — thanks to some confirmation from the company and a few renders here and there. However, a new leak from Evan Blass and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/03/exclusive-leak-motorola-edge-50-ultra.html">Android Headlines</a> showcases the upcoming Edge 50 Ultra in all its glory.</p>
<p>Blass has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1774263867872285030">posted multiple videos</a> of what appears to be the Edge 50 Ultra&apos;s marketing material ahead of its release on X. The first one in the lot confirms the slightly curved display accompanied by very minimal bezels and a thinner middle frame. </p><p>The design reminds us of the older Galaxy S10 series at first glance. On the back, however, it sports a textured finish, and the protruding camera housing blends into the rear frame seamlessly, mirroring the company&apos;s updated design language as seen on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a>.</p><p>The housing in the back features three cameras, and a selfie shooter is spotted on the punch-hole display on the front. The second teaser from Blass highlights the Edge 50 Ultra&apos;s beautiful bright display alongside the device&apos;s stereo speaker setup — as speaker grilles can be seen on the top and bottom panes of the Ultra phone. </p><p>The other three videos, however, indicate that the device will have solid display protection, water resistance, and some skin tone enhancements, the latter of which is expected to be a significant camera feature on the Edge 50 Ultra. The triple camera setup will allegedly include a 50MP primary accompanied by a periscopic lens, a secondary camera, and a laser autofocus between the sensors. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Android Headlines also shared the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra renders that reveal some high-quality images of the device showcasing from all angles. The Ultra is expected to sport in three colorways: Peach Fuzz, Black, and Light Beige. The first two will likely have a vegan leather finish, and the Light Beige will be seen in some textured finish. </p><p>According to Android Headlines, the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra will be powered by the latest Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a> SoC that sits right under the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, powering most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> this year. This could point to a reasonably priced flagship from Motorola as well as a new AI focus.</p><p>The device is expected to be announced in April alongside the other models, with speculation pointing to April 3, 2024, when the Edge 50 Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/motorolaindia/status/1771786525254045866">set to launch with a new Hello UI</a> for Android 14. This is also partly based on the date seen on the home screen (although this date appears on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a> renders, so take that with a grain of salt). Additionally, the availability of regions may vary, and the Edge 50 Ultra is also expected to be named the X50 Ultra in some regions. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Garmin has released a beta update (version 17.10) for several smartwatches, introducing numerous changes.</li><li>The beta is available for models like the Fenix 7/7 Pro, Fenix 7s/7s Pro, Fenix 7x/7x Pro, Epix/Epix Pro Gen 2 (in various sizes), Enduro 2, MARQ Gen 2, and Quatix 7.</li><li>Notably, the beta temporarily disables the ECG feature on the Fenix 7 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Garmin has released a fresh beta update for a bunch of its smartwatches, packing in loads of changes.</p><p>The smartwatch maker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/beta-program/fenix-7-series/f/announcements/365294/beta-version-17-10---check-for-updates-only" target="_blank">announced</a> that beta version 17.10 is up for grabs for a bunch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatchhttps://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> like the Fenix 7/7 Pro, Fenix 7s/7s Pro, Fenix 7x/7x Pro, Epix/Epix Pro Gen 2 (in 42mm / 47mm / 51mm sizes), Enduro 2, MARQ Gen 2, and Quatix 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Garmin-adds-dozens-of-new-features-and-bug-fixes-to-current-flagship-smartwatches-with-new-update.820399.0.html" target="_blank">NotebookCheck</a>). But if you&apos;re rocking a Garmin MARQ Aviator Gen 2 or Tactix 7, you&apos;re not in on the beta party.</p><p>Garmin has dropped a hefty changelog for version 17.10 beta, packed with tons of fresh features and some tweaks to make things better.</p>
<ul><li>Added ability to find a lost phone during an activity with GPS.</li><li>Added Applied Ballistics Wind Mode (Tactix only).</li><li>Added Indoor Walk activity.</li><li>Added Messenger App.</li><li>Added Recovery Advisor as an option in Morning Report and glances.</li><li>Added self evaluation to more activity types.</li><li>Fixed battery saver mode being allowed as a power mode name.</li><li>Fixed incorrect DSW on watch face.</li><li>Fixed issue causing the cadence flashlight to enable incorrectly when in an activity resume later state.</li><li>Fixed issue with ski run count in the Last Sport glance.</li><li>Fixed issue with the altimeter glance when in large font mode.</li><li>Fixed issues with Morning Report workouts page.</li><li>Fixed issues with some watch face data fields.</li><li>Fixed potential issue causing the touchscreen to not fully function after a display wakeup.</li><li>Fixed potential issue with the weather map overlay.</li><li>Fixed potential shutdown in morning report.</li><li>Fixed potential shutdown in the body battery widget when viewing near midnight.</li><li>Fixed potential shutdown when loading activity history with auto lock enabled.</li><li>Improved access to additional characters on the touch keyboard by adding a press and hold option to some keys.</li><li>Improved find my phone alert prompt UI.</li><li>Renamed Climb sport to Mountaineering.</li></ul>
<p>However, Garmin mentions that this beta will turn off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-garmin-ecg-app">ECG (electrocardiogram) feature</a> in the Fenix 7 series. So, if you&apos;re all about those regular ECG checks, you might want to skip this update.</p><p>Nevertheless, according to Garmin, once this beta hits its final stage right before the official release, ECG functionality should come back online for the Fenix 7 series. The company assures us that ECG should function normally on other compatible models.</p><p>If you&apos;re part of Garmin&apos;s public beta program, you can snag version 17.10 beta by heading to <strong>Menu</strong> > <strong>System</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong> and hitting <strong>Check For Updates</strong> on your watch.</p><p>Keep your eyes peeled towards the end of the public beta cycle because Garmin plans to start sending out beta updates through normal methods via OTA updates.</p>

<p>My high school running coach told us that music was a crutch. What he <em>didn&apos;t</em> tell us was that adult responsibilities, a 40-hour workweek, and the temptation of video games would make finding the time and motivation for running really difficult! Nowadays, I&apos;m perfectly happy to hunt for the best running apps and playlists to serve as that motivational crutch. </p><p>Below, I&apos;ll focus on the running and step-tracking apps I use (or have used and enjoyed) that provide audio motivation, training planning (and shaming), social motivation, and everything else you can use to get yourself out the door, running at the right pace and sustaining that effort long enough to improve.</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-audio-motivation-apps-2">My favorite audio motivation apps</h2>
<p>I&apos;ll start with the obvious: A good music playlist is the difference between getting into the zone and feeling demoralized by your ragged, panting breath during hard runs. I&apos;m not going to advocate for a specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming app</a>, but most of the big ones have curated workout playlists matched to specific heart rates or genres.</p><p>A running coach might tell you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/mar/13/running-with-music-for-against" target="_blank">not to rely on music</a>, but I think it&apos;s fine if you use it safely — try bone conduction or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open-ear headphones</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a> so you hear your surroundings — and don&apos;t overtrain to match up-tempo songs. I try to curate my own hours-long playlists for different race lengths or training types, so I have a comfortable familiarity with what&apos;s coming instead of being thrown off by new, popular songs that aren&apos;t my cup of tea.</p><p>Beyond music, you might be surprised to learn that Audible is one of my most-used running companions. Whenever I&apos;m marathon training and upping my mileage, the daily hours on the trail can get dull after a while, and I use the time to sink into old favorites that will entertain but not distract. My Wheel of Time series re-listen has carried me through dozens of runs and post-run walks.</p>

<p>You can&apos;t go wrong with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-zombies-run-marvel-move-helped-me-hit-personal-best">Zombies, Run! and Marvel Move</a>. The decade-old app began with a simple premise — if you slow down, virtual zombies would scare you back on pace or "eat" you if you failed — but has added hundreds of audio-drama missions about post-apocalyptic survival as a runner. </p><p>More recently, they licensed Marvel missions where you&apos;re teamed up with Thor and Loki, the X-Men, and other popular heroes. I love using these missions for hard-paced tempo and track runs; while Audible is relaxing but can be distracting, these missions come in short bursts of entertainment that keep you in the zone, but don&apos;t overstay their welcome before switching back to your music. </p><p>Otherwise, if you&apos;re looking for more traditional audio coaching, I&apos;m not as familiar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-couch-5k-apps">couch-to-5K apps</a> out there because I&apos;ve been running 5K+ for a couple of decades, but I&apos;ve heard very good things about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aaptiv.com/" target="_blank">Aaptiv&apos;s personalized coaching cues</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dkaTFqngwaK6qVmVNPZkJd" name="Fitbit-Charge-6-hourly-activity.jpeg" alt="The hourly activity widget on the Fitbit Charge 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkaTFqngwaK6qVmVNPZkJd.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All the music and coaching apps above motivate you once you&apos;ve already decided to run. But for those exhausted days where slacking off sounds more appealing? You&apos;ll need some kind of positive (or negative) reinforcement to force yourself to gear up and step outside, whether for running or walking.</p><p>I&apos;m a fan of tracking systems like Fitbit&apos;s Active Zone Minutes or Garmin&apos;s Intensity Minutes, which give you a weekly goal to hit and a recommended daily workout, but take context into account and tell you to rest if you&apos;re physically exhausted. For comparison, a daily ring-closing system like Apple&apos;s or Samsung&apos;s will tell you to work out for 30 minutes without fail, even the day after a marathon, which makes me want to ignore it.</p><p>More specifically, I like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong">Fitbit&apos;s hourly move reminders</a>, which stop me from being too stiff and sedentary throughout the day. With Garmin, I use its watches&apos; daily suggested workouts to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">boost my VO2 Max</a>, or my body&apos;s ability to convert oxygen into energy. I didn&apos;t like seeing my VO2 Max dipping low during the pandemic, so I followed its suggestions for track workouts and low aerobic runs until I had climbed five points from "Good" to "Excellent" for my age.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NwYJLboggNAMCiwv4o72EV" name="Garmin-VO2-Max-chart.jpeg" alt="A VO2 Max chart on the Garmin Forerunner 965, showing a steady climb and a score of 49." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NwYJLboggNAMCiwv4o72EV.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/which-garmin-forerunner-model-right-me">Garmin Forerunner watch</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit tracker</a> to access these tools, and I want to focus on apps that anyone can use for motivation, regardless of which fitness watch you own. </p><p>I make a point to go out daily, whether for walks or runs, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month">hit 10,000 steps a day</a> (or close to it). Sometimes, I&apos;ll feel too tired to run, but after starting a walk, I&apos;ll realize I <em>do</em> have enough energy. If I don&apos;t, I look to apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-hike/id1557127861" target="_blank">Fantasy Hike</a> — a copyright-safe quest to walk to Mount <del>Doom</del> Fire like the Fellowship of the Ring — that make every step and mile feel meaningful, even if I&apos;m not running. I just wish it wasn&apos;t iOS-exclusive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8mb7FLB6qWk4nwFeAwnHya" name="Fantasy-Hike-promo-image.jpeg" alt=""Fantasy Hike: Walk to Mount Fire" promotional image on the Forge7 website for the walking app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mb7FLB6qWk4nwFeAwnHya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1056" height="594" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Forge7)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walkthedistance&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Walk the Distance</a> doesn&apos;t have the fantasy hook, but the premise of adding up your miles and steps to have you virtually hike the Appalachian Trail and compete with other hikers should give Android and iOS users some nice motivation. </p><p>The same goes with cute apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pikmin&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Pikmin Bloom</a>, where more steps equals more Pikmin companions in your team, or more general goal-setting apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finch.finch&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank">Finch</a> where you can take care of your pet by taking care of yourself. </p><p>Otherwise, I&apos;d say don&apos;t be afraid to go lo-fi for your training tracking. This year, I&apos;m using a Google doc to log how many runs, miles, and steps I&apos;ve completed per month to see if I&apos;m on track to hit my yearly goals. Not everything <em>needs</em> to go through a specific app!</p>
<h2 id="my-favorite-social-training-apps-2">My favorite social training apps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY" name="strava-live-segments.jpeg" alt="Strava app showing Live Segment records" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RqLHv9Ssu2dU4mCznxLY.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s hard to recommend any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-apps-android">best running apps</a> because (A) they&apos;re all quite similar in what they offer, and (B) which you pick will depend on which app your fellow runners or walkers use. </p><p>Strava, MapMyRun, Runkeeper, Nike Run Club, and the rest have their strengths with community maps, live segments, leaderboards, coaching, running clubs, and so on. But it&apos;ll be a lonely experience if you pick the wrong app, so I&apos;d say wait to join your local in-person running club and see what they use.</p><p>I like Strava&apos;s focus on segments, which has you competing with local runners in both pace and number of times completed. I&apos;ve battled to be the local legend at the nearest track with a few other runners, for example, and I like competing against others (and myself) on the segments within my favorite running routes, since Strava has a partnership with Garmin to show Live Segments on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I can&apos;t say for certain which app will work best for you. Some people need competition with friends (or strangers), while others prefer a game or fantasy scenario that makes every mile feel more meaningful. Beginner runners may need more in-depth coaching, while veteran runners will want AI-based training plans like Garmin Coach based on their fitness level.</p><p>What matters, in my mind, is that you need to find a concrete, positive goal. Simply telling yourself to walk or run every day will inevitably lead to you losing motivation or overtraining until you hurt yourself. </p><p>But if you&apos;re racing your loved ones to Mordor while working through your audiobook or podcast backlog, you&apos;re setting yourself up to succeed! Or for more serious runners, aiming for concrete fitness goals — like the most miles in your Strava group or a significant VO2 Max boost — is more likely to succeed than just trying to run hard every single day.</p>

<p>Introduced in March 2024, the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra comes in four cool colors: Skyline Blue, Eternal Black, Misty Grey, and Desert Sand, but this is just on the back: the sides in each are black. It’s equipped with a 6.78-inch flexible E6 AMOLED display with a 2,400 x 1,080-pixel resolution, a narrow bezel, and a 94% display-to-body ratio. The phone is a stunning sight to behold, thanks to the glossy matte finish featuring the Chinese symbol for “people,” which makes it stand out among the pack. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> screen, meanwhile, makes it durable as well, along with the IP68 certification for water and dust resistance. </p><p>With 1,600 nits brightness and 2,500 nits peak brightness, you can easily view the screen in all types of lighting conditions, including even bright sunlight outdoors. The adaptive refresh rate goes from 1-120Hz to adjust based on what activity you’re engaged in, but there’s also a boost up to 144Hz for gaming. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">his Zenfone 11 Ultra review</a>, however, Android Central’s Harish Jonnalagadda says you can’t manually turn this on, and it only works in certain gaming titles. </p><p>The phone’s dimensions are 6.45 x 3.02 x .035 inches, and it weighs 225 grams, making it slightly bigger and heavier than the Google Pixel 8 Pro, but not by much. Jonnalagadda admits that while the phone is tall and heavy, ASUS “nailed the weight distribution.” It comes with either 256GB or 512GB storage, which is not expandable, so you’ll likely want to opt for as much storage as you can get locally. </p><p>Coming out of the box loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and additional customization options through ZenUI (though you can choose to use only stock Android), it comes with the promise of two major software updates and four years of security updates. If you plan on holding onto the device for longer than a few years, this could sway your decision since Google promises more than three times the number of software updates and almost twice as long a period for security updates. </p><p>Powered by a 5,500mAh battery, the phone supports 65W HyperCharge as well as wireless charging, so you can be confident that it will last all day and will be up and running in no time once you do need to recharge it. </p><p>Additional features you’ll find with the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra include dual stereo speakers that Jonnalagadda says are “among the loudest in this category,” dual mics with ASUS Noise Reduction technology, fingerprint sensor, face recognition, Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, dual SIMs, and 5G. A rarity nowadays, it also has a 3.5mm input for connecting wired headphones and earbuds, which is great if you’re in a pinch and only have a backup wired pair on hand.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Google Pixel 8 Pro, introduced in October 2023, can be picked up in the traditional Google colors: Porcelain, Bay, and Obsidian. It has a 6.7-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED display with 2,992 x 1,344 resolution, a peak of 2,400 nits of brightness (1,600 nits), and an adaptive refresh rate from 1-120Hz. The edgeless screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, which is both scratch- and fingerprint-resistant, and the phone is also IP68-rated. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">his Pixel 8 Pro review</a>, Android Central’s Nicholas Sutrich says the matte glass back of the phone “feels so good, it’s ridiculous,” adding that the phone is overall comfortable to hold thanks to its rounded corners. </p><p>The phone is a smidge smaller than the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra at 6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches and a bit lighter at 213 grams. You can choose from four storage capacities: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, but this is not expandable either, so keep that in consideration when choosing which version to get. If you want to consider cloud storage, the Google Pixel 8 Pro comes with a six-month trial to Google One Premium with up to 2TB storage. But you’ll have to pay beyond that period of time if you choose to continue. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro also comes with Android 14, but the big benefit here is that you get up to seven years of OS and security updates, so this phone is a good one if you’re in it for the long haul. It’s also worth noting that it comes with a six-month subscription to Fitbit Premium, which you can use alongside either a Fitbit smartwatch or fitness tracker or a Google Pixel Watch, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>. Additionally, get three months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> if you’re a new subscriber. </p><p>Equipped with a 5,050mAh battery as well, the Google Pixel 8 Pro also has an Extreme Battery Saver mode that can extend this to up to 72 hours, ideal if you’re traveling and forgot your charger at home. In addition to support for fast wireless charging, the phone can also use battery share to recharge other compatible devices, like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-2020-review">Google Pixel Buds</a>.  </p><p>Find a similar feature set like stereo speakers, three mics with noise suppression, fingerprint unlock, face unlock, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and 5G. This phone, however, does not have a headphone jack.</p>

<p>Head-to-head, how do these two phones compare in terms of specs?</p>

<p>The two phones are pretty similar when it comes to the specifications, which each having a leg up in different areas on the other. But let&apos;s dive deeper.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-power-processing-and-audio-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Power, processing, and audio</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-22.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ueShQmUqKzotPqFVYKgTDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both these phones have powerful processors and other goodies to keep up with your daily tasks. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra comes powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor, so you don’t have to worry that it won’t be zippy and able to keep up with all your multitasking and data-intensive productivity or entertainment needs. Get 12GB RAM up to a blazing fast 16GB, depending on the model you choose. </p><p>The phone is loaded with tons of AI-powered features. You’ll see things like AI noise cancellation to cancel out background noises, but many of the features are still in beta mode. With AI call translator, for example, it will translate your words into text and voice so the person on the other end of a call or message can understand you and vice versa. This makes it pretty seamless to have a conversation with someone who speaks another language. </p><p>Also in beta is AI transcript, which transcribes phone calls in real-time, a dream for a journalist (present company included!), student, or anyone else trying to furiously take notes from a call or recording and transcribe it manually later. Another beta option is AI wallpaper, which is powered by Qualcomm’s NPU. With this feature, the phone crafts personalized images in your preferred style so the device intelligently adapts to a look and feel you’ll love. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra excels when it comes to audio performance based on its impressive specs. Along with dual stereo speakers, there’s support for lossless audio and Hi-Res audio up to 384kH2/32-bit when listening via wired headphones. There’s also Dirac Virtuo for Headphone spatial sound, so you get an immersive experience when listening to tunes, podcasts, playing games, or watching videos. Indeed, Jonnalagadda says the tuning makes a “legitimate difference” when playing games or streaming content. With the full AptX suite of audio codecs, you can confidently stream high-res tunes through a good pair of headphones. </p><p>Additionally, there’s a PC continuity feature that can be likened to Samsung’s DeX. With ASUS GlideX, you can mirror your phone and share videos and photos across different devices. Along with extending the screen, you can also use the phone’s camera as a webcam, enhancing your desktop set-up. Meanwhile, Phone Link allows for syncing with a laptop or PC to transfer files, take calls, and manage tasks. </p><p>For gaming, there’s the game turbo engine, which Jonnalagadda says is the “best you’ll find on any phone.” A neat feature called Video Genie mutes calls and notifications while you’re playing so you don’t get distracted. But Jonnalagadda notes that sometimes he experienced overheating during extended gaming sessions.</p>

<p>What about the Google Pixel 8 Pro? It is powered by Google Tensor G3 with Google AI and has 12GB RAM, regardless of the storage option, which means you’ll get a fantastic experience across the board. </p><p>Google offers useful features in the AI realm as well, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screen</a> for automatically screening spam calls, silently answering them for you so you don’t have to deal with them, nor the phone continuously ringing. Sutrich says it’s easily his favorite Pixel feature, but it&apos;s also simple to turn off for those who don’t want it. </p><p>Live Translate works out of the gate, making it easy to connect with colleagues, friends, and family in multiple languages. Use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to summarize, read aloud, and even translate web pages, as well as compose messages using your voice. There are also useful apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> and Google Maps with upgraded immersive views. Gmail also offers new and useful prompts. For security, the Titan M2 chip and VPN by Google One is an added benefit, as are features like car crash detection. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpaper</a> is another neat addition, allowing you to choose from preset themes that include paintings, terrains, textures, and more. Once you select a term, like glacier or beach, context-sensitive options appear. When you are ready, select Generate, and you’ll see four images created by generative AI from which you can choose or ask for more. </p><p>Gaming is doable on the phone, but framerate dips regularly, Sutrich finds. While he could easily play games like Minecraft, he had a hard time running even simple visual games like Fortnite. If you’re looking for a phone for gaming, then you’ll want to keep this in mind. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-google-pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor">temperature sensor</a> has proven to be more of a novelty feature than anything else, but it’s still a cool option to have. Hold the phone by an object, like a boiling pot of water or a baby bottle, and it can tell you the temperature. This feature will become more useful if it officially works like a thermometer: Google has applied to the FDA for the ability to use it to take your own temperature (or that of someone else) and store the data in the Fitbit app. But this is still pending. </p><p>While the Google Pixel 8 Pro doesn’t have all the audio features you’ll find on the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, it does support Spatial Audio, so you can expect a wonderfully immersive sound experience from this device as well.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-what-about-the-cameras-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: What about the cameras?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR" name="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-21.jpg" alt="ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d5f9RjKg8RgoUUzmPEB9oR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI-powered features in both phones work with their cameras as well. </p><p>The ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra has a 50MP main camera, 32MP telephoto camera with a 90° FOV, 3x telephoto, and built-in optical image stabilization (OIS), a 13MP ultra-wide camera, and a 32MP front camera for selfies. Jonnalagadda’s verdict: the phone takes great photos in daylight with nice dynamic range and color accuracy, and detailed photos in low light scenarios as well, albeit with some fringing and loss of detail. The 3x zoom lens leaves something to be desired, but overall, he says the camera in this phone are the best of any Zenfone model he has tried to date. </p><p>A portrait video mode uses an AI algorithm to provide a natural depth-of-field effect when capturing videos. It can also recognize focal points in real time and faces, including those of pets as well as people. This is a feature pet owners (and lovers!) will appreciate. </p><p>You’ll purportedly get smooth photos and videos thanks to the 6-axis hybrid stabilizer 3.0 and Super Hyper Steady EIS algorithm. OZO Audio technology, meanwhile, is used for ensuring lifelike audio and 3D sound in recordings. </p><p>With the 10x zoom with HyperClarity AI algorithm, the phone can also handle direct processing of RAW files. AI Object Sense can recognize objects and optimize them using a special algorithm. </p><p>Another cool photo-related feature is for after the photos are captured: semantic search makes it easy to find what you’re looking for via relevant results provided by AI and using natural language. You can search for photos based on parameters like events, times, locations, or even objects that appear in the photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro is no slouch in the AI photo department either. It has a 50MP main camera, a 48MP telephoto camera, a 48MP ultra-wide camera with improved Macro Focus, and a 10.5MP selfie front camera. With Super Res Zoom, you can get up close and personal with subjects, zooming up to 30x without losing detail, focus, or clarity. Sutrich says the cameras are the best overall of any Android phone he’s used to date. </p><p>There are professional controls, too, with advanced camera settings for shutter speed as well as Night Sight and astrophotography. With any photo, Google AI technology works in the background to reduce noise and boost quality, both in still photos and videos, and in any lighting condition. </p><p>Google’s photo editing features have become favorites, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> for making custom edits and quality enhancements to photos. While Sutrich says it works incredibly well, he also noticed the phone tends to get warm when using it, but it doesn’t overheat. There’s also Best Take for combining similar photos of the same thing to keep the “best take” shot (no more closed eyes or fidgeting babies when everyone else is smiling!), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a> and Face Unblur, Portrait Mode, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> for removing unwanted elements from photos. </p><p>AI extends to video as well, with features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> that uses Google AI to reduce distracting sounds when shooting outdoors or in louder conditions, like when a furnace is humming in the background of your dance video. Video Boost can also be used to adjust color, lighting, stabilization, and graininess.</p>
<h2 id="asus-zenfone-11-ultra-vs-google-pixel-8-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mHgAJ5vvUQhfVEZ3gfK3Sg" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porcelain-03.jpg" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 8 Pro on the basement stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHgAJ5vvUQhfVEZ3gfK3Sg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>It’s decision time now. In the showdown of ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 8 Pro, which should you buy as your next device? </p><p>When it comes to the ASUS Zenfone 11 Ultra, which is effectively a rebadged ROB Phone 8, as Jonnalagadda points out, it might not live up to expectations. “ASUS went from making the best small phone,” he says in the review, “to a device that doesn’t quite have a distinct visual identity.” He loves the AI features and says ZenUI is one of his favorite Android skins. However, the cameras aren’t as good as those in its class, namely the Google Pixel 8 Pro. </p><p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro might not be as powerful a phone overall, and it doesn’t have as big a battery. But it has better cameras and is supported for longer than you’ll probably even keep the phone. That means when you are ready to upgrade, you have a better chance of getting good money if you want to resell or trade it in. You can also confidently hand it over to a friend or family member, and they’ll still be able to enjoy years of use with it. That counts for a lot. </p><p>Sutrich calls the Google Pixel 8 Pro the “king of the Androids,” and for good reason. With its combination of premium features, AI integration, fabulous cameras, and affordable price, it’s tough to beat. Thus, it makes sense as the top pick between these two. You’ll get more bang for your buck, and it will last a long, long time with solid new features flowing consistently through Feature Drops.

<ul><li>Google Play Points has a weekly program that lets users have a chance at winning a "Weekly Prize."</li><li>This week, there's a "Super Weekly Prize," and it's the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro flagships.</li><li>There are 100 Pixel 8 and another 100 Pixel 8 Pro phones available, with both models featuring the Mint colorway.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Want a new smartphone? If you&apos;re a Google Play Points member, you might be in luck. This week, Google is adding a "Super Weekly Prize," and it&apos;s a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro phone. Google is essentially raffling off smartphones to Play Points users, and there are 200 phones available in total. The promotion lasts from March 29 to April 4, but who knows how long it&apos;ll be until all the Pixel 8 devices are won, so you&apos;ll want to act pretty fast.</p><p>The Super Weekly Prize is available for Google Play Points members on the Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/03/29/google-play-points-super-weekly-prize/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted. Though 200 phones might sound like a lot, it&apos;s far and away the rarest prize available in the giveaway. There are 100 Pixel 8 and 100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> phones available, but there are over 34,00 prizes available as Platinum Prizes.</p><p>Over 10,000 users can win 1,000 Google Play Points, and another 23,800 users can net 500 Google Play Points (Android Central&apos;s Derrek Lee was able to score this prize). Then, of course, there are the 200 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series phones, which are all in the Mint colorway that was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-mint-green">recently introduced as a mid-cycle refresh</a>. However, you could also end up receiving the regular weekly prize, not the Platinum Prizes listed.</p><p>The good thing is that you don&apos;t have to risk any Play Points for a shot at the Platinum Prizes; you only have to qualify for one of the three higher tiers.</p>

<p>Here is some of the fine print related to the giveaway that Google shows in the Google Play Points page:</p>
<ul><li>Play to win one prize per week until Friday at 12:00 AM local time</li><li>Prizes may vary by level, and are available to Gold, Platinum, and Diamond levels. Additional eligibility requirements may apply.</li><li>Prizes are subject to availability and may be limited. New prizes are available on Friday at 12:00 AM local time.</li></ul>
<p>Playing for the grand prize is quick and easy. You have to claim the shot at the Super Weekly Prize on the Google Play Points page. Then, a medallion will appear on-screen, and you can tap it to reveal your prize. You&apos;ll learn instantly which prize you&apos;ve won, so there&apos;s no need to anxiously wait in anticipation. </p><p>Google says that prizes are limited in availability and may run out, but you can see how many of each prize are left before you play. </p>

This merger makes it seamless for users to watch all their content in one app rather than switching back and forth. If users aren&apos;t subscribed to the bundle, they can find Hulu&apos;s content available via "upsell options" across multiple devices at an added $2 monthly.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> also wanted to make the merger visually evident, so it&apos;s launching a new campaign, starting off with a new logo. The company states the rollout will include a new Disney Plus intro color palette that mixes Hulu&apos;s green with the legacy blue.</p><p>Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer at Disney Entertainment, said, "[the] official launch of Hulu on Disney+ gives viewers even more opportunities to easily discover and enjoy thousands of titles all in one place, underscoring the extraordinary value of the Disney Bundle."</p>

The leaks suggest that the Pixel 9 will sport a smaller 6.03-inch display, with 152.8 x 71.9 x 8.5mm dimensions and a potential 12mm bump due to its camera placement.</p><p>The upcoming series could showcase a horizontal camera array for a pill-shaped look, similar to the Pixel Fold, and will arrive with two cameras like its previous model. The post adds the Pixel 9 may offer a completely flat display with four rounded corners around its frame. </p><p>There&apos;s more: in January, a batch of images leaked and were touted as the base Pixel 9, but information now suggests that it was the Pixel 9 Pro with a 6.1-inch flat display. At the same time, some more images of the device leaked, but OnLeaks claims that those were of a third model: the "Pixel 9 Pro XL," and not the Pro model.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The future is going to be powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and to make sure the technology benefits everyone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147831">United Nations recently passed its first-ever resolution on AI</a>. This is a big deal for a hollow set of unenforceable suggestions, so let&apos;s break down what this means for you and the world.</p><p>The core message is safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. Co-sponsored by over 120 countries, the resolution emphasizes developing AI that respects human rights and promotes sustainable development. It also says AI systems shouldn&apos;t discriminate or reinforce biases and should be designed to solve problems like climate change and poverty.</p><p>Sounds good enough, right? Even so, we still have a long way to go.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-good-about-the-resolution-2">What&apos;s good about the resolution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.30%;"><img id="uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP" name="UN-general-assembly.jpg" alt="UN General Assembly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQW7JkVWyTjXAc7HsNCRjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="530" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: United Nations)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resolution acknowledges the "digital divide" between developed and developing countries. Not everyone has equal access to technology, and the UN is calling for collaboration to ensure everyone has the chance to participate in the AI revolution. This could involve sharing resources and knowledge to help developing nations build their own AI capabilities.</p><p>The UN isn&apos;t just pointing fingers at governments here. This resolution is a call to action for everyone—countries, businesses, researchers, and even regular folks like you and me. We all have a role to play in shaping the future of AI. Because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your next phone</a> will be chock full of AI, you are doing your part even if you don&apos;t know it.</p>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution is a positive step towards a future where AI works for everyone. By focusing on safety, human rights, and global cooperation, we can harness the power of AI to build a better world.</p><p>The resolution itself <em>isn&apos;t</em> a set of rules but a framework for future discussions and collaborations. It&apos;s a commitment from the international community to work together and ensure AI benefits all of humanity. We can expect to see more specific guidelines emerge in the coming years.... and that&apos;s its biggest problem.</p>
<h2 id="toothless-tiger-2">Toothless tiger</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La" name="kittens.jpg" alt="Kittens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3jE89KMYBLKVFTNuwAe7La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PetsRadar.com)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resolution promoting safe and beneficial artificial intelligence was a landmark achievement. It signifies a global recognition of the need to harness AI&apos;s power for good while mitigating potential risks. However, while this is a positive step, the resolution itself has limitations that require us to keep the conversation going.</p><p>The biggest shortcoming lies in the resolution&apos;s non-binding nature. Unlike Security Council resolutions, these don&apos;t hold legal weight. This means countries with vested interests in autonomous weapons development, for example, might not feel compelled to alter course. The resolution relies on "encouragement" for responsible AI development, which has limitations.</p>
<p>The UN is only as powerful as the few "major" countries allow it to be. Countries like China, Russia, and the United States usually only approve and support the UN when a thing aligns with their interests. Since these countries have the power to unilaterally veto any resolution, the good intentions of other member-states mean nothing.</p><p>A nonbinding agreement that was unanimously adopted means nothing. But it&apos;s the only way a resolution like this would pass. Getting "words on paper" is an important first step towards real, meaningful work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n" name="sundar-pichai-oct-2015-5.jpg" alt="Sundar Pichai" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXqHuXy6g2gEQ2LxYjRz9n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a global set of rules, each nation or governing body has to step in. We&apos;ve seen this with things like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Biden Administration&apos;s recent order</a> that ensures the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Department of Homeland Security are working towards a way to test that AI systems are both safe and secure before they are released. This followed a (nonbinding) agreement between 18 countries declaring that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-britain-other-countries-ink-agreement-make-ai-secure-by-design-2023-11-27/">AI systems be made secure by design</a>.</p><p>The EU has also enacted legislation regulating AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-provisional-agreement-ai-act-regulate-artificial-intelligence">making it the first government to do so</a>. In the landmark act, the EU also has laid the groundwork for enforcement options.</p><p>Another alternative way to self-regulate AI is what we&apos;ve seen in Canada. Before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-canada-launch">the release of Google Gemini</a>, Google met with "experts, policymakers, and regulators across different sectors" to ensure AI was responsible and worked well for the people of Canada, according to Product Manager Jules Walker.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, the resolution is a crucial first step. It fosters international dialogue and establishes a foundation for future, more specific regulations. Here&apos;s what could be done as a next step:</p>
<ul><li>Member states can build upon the resolution by developing supplementary agreements with concrete enforcement mechanisms.</li><li>International bodies can work towards establishing global standards for AI development and deployment.</li><li>Developed nations can assist developing countries in building the infrastructure and expertise needed for responsible AI use.</li></ul>
<p>The UN&apos;s AI resolution might not be a silver bullet; it&apos;s a call to action. By acknowledging its limitations and working towards a more robust framework, we can ensure AI becomes a force for good on a global scale.</p><p>If the world instead chooses to ignore these guidelines, we&apos;ll see an AI free-for-all where a few powerful countries and corporations decide our fate.</p>
