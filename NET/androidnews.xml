                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has a new streaming box called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer 4K</a>. It replaces the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-chromecast-google-tv-its-first-tv-stick-years">Chromecast with Google TV</a>, which replaced the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast</a> models. Think of it as the successor to the small dongle that started it all with all the software and extras added along the way.</p><p>Google also bumped up the price substantially, charging $100. That&apos;s pretty steep compared to the $30 the previous model cost. However, it could be worth it, as it has better hardware that can support advanced media codecs and integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI models</a>. That depends on what you need it to do. </p><p>It&apos;s not for me, though, because I&apos;m not the target market, and Google knows it. This device was made for most people who do not need a "professional" device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="R6gNBNHh4ViaZf5GSX9B9F" name="nvidia-shield-tv-pro-remote-hero.jpg" alt="NVIDIA Shield" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R6gNBNHh4ViaZf5GSX9B9F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m still using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Nvidia Shield TV Pro</a> because I want to do more than stream media from online sources. I have 8TB of storage attached to my Shield and use Plex, so I can stream my own media through the Shield. Yes, you can technically plug external storage into the Google TV Streamer, but the Shield was <em>made</em> to do this, and even has Plex built into the device&apos;s software.</p><p>Others do even more with devices like the Shield Pro—there are plenty of different ways to use a good "Pro" TV box, and having one that runs Android means there is plenty of ready-made software to help you do it.</p>
<p>People who use these advanced features aren&apos;t necessarily super-nerds. There is a market for hardware and software that makes setting up your own media streaming device pretty easy.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean very many people do it, though.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the thing with Google. The company does things we think are dumb, like killing off services and products or replacing a product everyone loves with something new and more expensive. It does it because it knows what people do with these services and devices.</p><p>Google decided that people would see the value in a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV</a> device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/turns-out-the-new-google-tv-streamer-has-a-different-chip-under-the-hood">with better hardware</a> that offers a better experience. It also decided that building a device that does more—and costs <em>much</em> more—is not something that would sell as easily because that market isn&apos;t very big. You could spend more money and try to make the TV Streamer into a home media streamer, but it wasn&apos;t designed to be.  </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7sycMDssfWc8meLrD4r3nU" name="chromecast-with-google-tv-aukey-usb-c-hub.jpg" alt="Chromecast With Google Tv Aukey Usb C Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sycMDssfWc8meLrD4r3nU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And this isn&apos;t just a hunch. When you use any device or service, the companies behind them know what you&apos;re doing, when you&apos;re doing it, and when you stopped. Other metrics, like how you used it, help tell the company what people are really doing. Nodoby at Google is keeping track of what you watch on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> because it doesn&apos;t need to know; data from a single user is useless in this case. Google looks at the overall stats to help decide how to proceed.</p><p>When a company decides to make a new or revised product, it considers what most people want. In this case, I think the company made the right decision because almost nobody reading this will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-plex-media-server-your-nvidia-shield-tv">set up a Plex server</a> or turn a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything">streaming box into a game console</a>. People want something that is easy to use and works well.</p>
<p>Google&apos;s biggest problem was deciding how cheap they could sell it. A "new" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM?th=1">Shield TV Pro is $199.99</a> and that&apos;s a really good price if you have a use for it.  The somewhat new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review" target="_blank">Chromecast with Google TV HD</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" target="_blank">just $30,</a> and that&apos;s a steal if you want something to plug in, hook up to Wi-Fi, and just watch "stuff." This new Google TV Streamer aims to be the middle ground with better hardware that costs more.</p><p>In addition, Google added some cool stuff, like a home control panel and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/android-15-matter-thread-netowrk-support-previewed" target="_blank">Thread and Matter</a>. You could say that some of this should have been there from the beginning, and I would agree, but this unifies Google&apos;s ecosystem of home products, and Google <strong>knows</strong> people wanted that to happen.</p>
<p>I can&apos;t decide if the Google TV Streamer is something you should buy without knowing why you want it. I&apos;m thinking about it because the new home control features have me curious about how well it works. It&apos;s not going to replace my Shield TV Pro, though, because it&apos;s already paid for and does exactly what I want it to do.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google details a back-to-school update for parents with kids rocking the Ace LTE smartwatch.</p><p>Kicking off Fitbit&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/fitbit-ace-back-to-school-update/">line of updates</a> is support for Greenlight and GoHenry debit cards. The company states parents can add their child&apos;s card to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Ace LTE</a> for contactless payment where Google Pay is accepted. Fitbit states support for each financial service is deliberate as both help facilitate responsible spending in children. </p><p>The Ace LTE gains transaction alerts, spending limits, and "allowance for chores." This feature is rolling out today (August 7) for all users.</p><p>Additionally, families new to either payment service can enroll through the Fitbit Ace app for a discount.</p>

<p>Healthy habits can seem long-winded for kids, which is why Fitbit is introducing them on the Ace LTE in the form of "Daily Quests." In partnership with Alliance for a Healthier Generation, users will soon find quests for living better lives.</p><p>This next feature, School Time, hits the smartwatch so parents can have peace of mind regarding their child&apos;s focus. The post states that parents can set a specific time frame when the watch&apos;s features are limited to avoid distractions.</p><p>Parents can also set "lunchtime," which lets their child mess around with their device when it&apos;s appropriate, and sit attentively during class.</p>

<p>Fitbit is also working on a way for parents to add their child&apos;s sibling to their Ace LTE as a contact. This will be done through the Ace app and users can add an older child with a phone or a younger one with a smartwatch. Fitbit states this should roll out "later this year."</p><p>Fitbit&apos;s newest games, Spirit Garden and Sproutlings, come into play when school is said and done. The company states it bolstered the gaming experience by implementing haptic feedback and ear-catching sounds while leaning on the Ace LTE&apos;s built-in accelerometer. Sproutlings lets kids raise and nurture pets and grow crops.</p><p>Spirit Garden is a mindful game that aims to help kids relax after a long day with guided practices into spirited lands and shrines. Games are great, but Fitbit says more active kids will rack up more "game time" to reach new heights.</p><p>The post adds that the Fitbit Ace LTE is available for $30 off at the Google Store from August 11 to 25. What&apos;s more, if users grab the annual Ace Pass data plan before August 31, they&apos;ll save 50%.</p><p>If "School Time" sounds familiar it&apos;s because Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">announced the feature&apos;s arrival on Android</a> last week. The functionality is the same as the Ace LTE, however, parents enabling it on a phone can control what apps their child can use. When active, kids can tap the "Available Apps" button to select which their parent has previously deemed appropriate during school hours.</p>

Not only are most smartwatches for kids irritatingly thick and chonky, but the software often leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>That&apos;s where the experts at Fitbit and Google come in. The Fitbit Ace LTE is the latest and (mostly) greatest in a line of kid-focused Fitbit devices that does things completely differently from its predecessors. Not only is it the first LTE-enabled Fitbit Ace wearable, but it&apos;s also an actual smartwatch—not just an activity tracker like previous Fitbit Ace bands.</p><p>But this isn&apos;t just a Pixel Watch 2 inside a more kid-friendly package. Google and Fitbit designed the experience from the ground up so kids not only feel like they have a powerful smartwatch on their wrist but also so that they feel like wearing a smartwatch makes sense.</p><p>From high-quality 3D games that are designed to keep your kids active throughout the day to a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet that can be customized with activity reward tickets, this is easily the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">best smartwatch for kids</a> ever made.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE retails for $229.95 and is sold at the Google Store, various carriers in the U.S., and stores like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE connects to the internet via Wi-Fi or LTE. A subscription is not required for basic Wi-Fi use but parents will need to subscribe to a Fitbit Ace Pass in order to activate LTE connectivity. An Ace Pass costs $9.99 per month or $119.99 per year.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE ships with a charging cable, bumper case, and one band. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/product/strange_arcade_woven_band_fitbit_ace_lte">sells additional Ace Bands</a> for $34.99. Each band ships with a sticker pack and digital goodies on the watch, including unique Noodles for the watch face, a unique digital character, and unique items that can be unlocked through movement.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f" name="fitbit-ace-lte-wearing-02.jpg" alt="A child wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XaVTvPAySzLpDikR82eH8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>True to the Fitbit brand, the Fitbit Ace LTE is designed entirely around the concept of encouraging movement all day. Instead of boring step tracking or standing notifications, Fitbit Ace LTE gives kids movement points earned through various activities. More intense movement grants more points, so kids who play sports, jump on trampolines, or generally have a lot of active playtime will find they score higher points throughout the day.</p><p>Kids will also get daily quests to complete that will award bonus points, like climbing a certain number of stairs, walking a certain number of steps, or even just moving for a specific length of time.</p><p>What&apos;s fantastic is that these points can be used for several things throughout the day, encouraging kids to keep in touch with their health data while playing fun games or earning cool items. Games are designed to be played for a few minutes at a time—at most, something I&apos;ll cover more in the next section—but each game works a little bit differently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:540px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR" name="fitbit-ace-lte-fishing.gif" alt="Playing the fishing game on a Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n3P8pEbJcFSCJoyqU2dojR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="540" height="304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some games allow you to spend points you&apos;ve earned throughout the day on activities and turns, while others will only let you play for a few minutes before requiring more movement. The number of points or steps required for the next move is hard-coded into each game, for better or worse, which means your kids know what they&apos;re getting into each time they play.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Each of the six games preloaded onto the phone are active, as well, requiring kids to move around instead of just tap the screen a few times.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each of the six games preloaded onto the watch is also active, requiring kids to move around instead of just tapping the screen a few times. My son&apos;s favorite game on the watch is a space strategy game where you conquer planets by defeating enemy squadrons. Aside from encouraging basic strategy skills, each round lets players physically aim with their wrists to blow up ships.</p><p>Likewise, the fishing game has players casting their line with their wrist, then reeling it by pulling it toward their body (see GIF above). Another game has kids dancing and wiggling around, while yet another is a kaiju golfing experience. What&apos;s particularly cool is that these six games will be refreshed every few months, providing plenty of entertainment value over the coming months.</p><p>That also helps give the monthly subscription cost a bit more added value since you&apos;ll constantly be getting new things. In fact, the first round of updated games just launched on August 7.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8mqw4BjCbnGBBYPNxhYHHA" name="fitbit-ace-lte-eejie-01.jpg" alt="Customizing the Eejie on a Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mqw4BjCbnGBBYPNxhYHHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Points can also be spent on customizing your Eejie, a sort of Tamagotchi-meets-Animal Crossing-type virtual pet that lives in Bit Valley. You can play games and buy furniture or outfits that can be used to further customize the Eejie and its space. As you level up, your Eejie&apos;s home gets bigger and you gain access to more items.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I want this virtual pet-meets-Animal Crossing game on my Pixel Watch now.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>My colleague, Michael Hicks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-should-add-virtual-pets-like-tamagotchi-for-fitness-motivation">has wanted this very kind of thing</a> on regular smartwatches for a while now. I also echo those sentiments and want to see Google and Fitbit bring this to the broader Wear OS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Buying additional Ace bands for your watch will also unlock new Eejies and new items and outfits that can be earned. You can even link Eejie&apos;s together if you have more than one child with a Fitbit Ace LTE or if their friends have one.</p><p>The bands themselves are very easy to add and remove with a handy button that you push in and then down. You&apos;ll need to have it off the wrist for this, so there&apos;s no danger of the band accidentally falling off, even during the craziest of times.</p><p>Swapping out a band will automatically change the Noodle on the watch face—that&apos;s the animated snake or worm-like creature that wraps around the time—but the Noodle can always be changed out if your child doesn&apos;t like the one that matches the band.</p>

<p>Kids will also love wearing the Fitbit Ace LTE because the hardware is so darn sleek looking. It&apos;s quite similar looking to some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">best Fitbit</a> trackers and smartwatches, which says a lot given the way most kids smartwatches look.</p><p>Case in point, my other two favorite smartwatches for kids, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUP</a>, are both undeniably chunky, especially when compared to the Fitbit Ace LTE. Not only that, but the Ace LTE is lighter and nicer looking overall, helping make it feel cool to wear such a nice-looking gadget.</p><p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is also surprisingly durable. The included bumper case snaps on easily and, thankfully, stays put even during vigorous activity. My son wore it to regular ninja warrior classes and even ran a 2-mile Spartan kids&apos; run with it on, and the watch still looks pristine. The bumper has some obvious scuffs on it, but that&apos;s fine since that&apos;s what it&apos;s made for.</p>

<p>There are only two buttons on the watch: the top one opens contacts, while the bottom one opens the arcade. Swiping down on the watch face brings up quick settings, and swiping up opens notifications. Swiping right shows your daily quests, while swiping left brings up Bit Valley.</p><p>Kids can call, text, or voice message any contacts that parents have input into the Fitbit Ace app on their smartphones. The UI itself is similar to any Wear OS watch, so if you&apos;re already a Wear OS user, you&apos;ll be able to jump in and familiarize yourself quickly.</p><p>You can even use tap-to-pay with the watch with supported debit and credit cards. Google only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-debit-card-school-returns-update">just launched this functionality</a>, though, so I wasn&apos;t able to test it for the review.</p><p>Parents can set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">school time</a> on the watch and limit the available activities during those scheduled hours. I didn&apos;t need to use those since it&apos;s summer, but they&apos;re there when you need them.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fitbit-ace-lte-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Fitbit Ace LTE: What could use improvement</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5LMyo2ZctPAWvjM53HPy8X" name="fitbit-ace-lte-bit-valley.jpg" alt="Customizing the Eejie home on the Fitbit Ace LTE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5LMyo2ZctPAWvjM53HPy8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicho)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I gave the Fitbit Ace LTE to my son, I was most excited to see how he liked the games. After all, one of the reasons the T-Mobile SyncUp watch is his previous favorite kids&apos; watch is because it has the famous Dino game on it. To say he was elated with the upgrade in visuals and interactivity in the Fitbit Ace LTE&apos;s games is an understatement.</p><p>That is until he ran up against the first "more activity required" message. My son isn&apos;t a couch potato unless we let him be, but the amount of activity the watch requires for such short sessions takes some of the fun away. His favorite space strategy game typically gives kids one full turn before requiring more movement. This isn&apos;t just a little bit of movement, either. It&apos;s like 20 minutes of running around.</p><p>The ratio feels more like an amusement park ride than anything, making you wait for ages before giving you just a few minutes (or seconds) of playtime. Fitbit calls this "interval-based gaming" and says that game sessions are designed to be 5 minutes or less.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>While the lack of fitness goal control annoyed me, the way points worked downright frustrated my son.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The concept is solid, and I like that there are obvious, "natural" limits to the games told through narrative, as Fitbit describes it, but I felt like the ratio of play-to-work was a bit off. As a parent, I&apos;d love it if Fitbit added a way for me to adjust these ratios and goals to better fit my son&apos;s goals or habits, even if that means keeping them in a range instead of giving me total free reign.</p><p>But while the lack of control annoys me, the way that points work downright frustrates my son. That&apos;s because each game works a bit differently in regard to movement mechanics and points. The space strategy game, for instance, requires you to use your points as you earn them. Most turns take between 12 and 18 movement points to play, which is theoretically fine, but the problem comes in when you&apos;re not looking at the watch constantly.</p><p>That&apos;s because you can&apos;t "bank" or store points. While you&apos;ll earn them throughout the day, you can only use so many at a time. In this game&apos;s case, only one turn may be "bought" at a time. That means if you ran a Spartan race like my son did this past weekend, all those points you earned still only give you one turn. In short, it just doesn&apos;t feel fair.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can't bank movement points. That means if you ran a Spartan race like my son did this past weekend, all those points you earned still only give you one turn in a game. In short, it just doesn't feel fair.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some of these limitations are designed with battery life in mind. The watch is rated at 16 hours of battery life per charge, and amazingly, my son never had the watch die on him once over the past several weeks. That certainly means the games are well-designed for this purpose, but it would still be nice to be able to scale things.</p><p>I was also a bit surprised at the lack of detailed health data provided by the watch. The Fitbit Ace LTE is essentially a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> built for kids. It&apos;s got the same health sensors on the underside, the same powerful processor inside, and it even uses the same charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AFn5Vbhk3kRwQhMKDcM5PL" name="0806.jpg" alt="A message saying you need to move to earn more movements in a Fitbit Ace LTE game" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFn5Vbhk3kRwQhMKDcM5PL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So why can&apos;t it do sleep tracking or let me see a graph of my son&apos;s heart rate throughout the day? All of the health data is wrapped into the watch&apos;s points system, and while the watch gives me some stats—light and active minutes throughout the day, number of floors climbed, and number of steps taken—I&apos;d love to be able to dial down into these more.</p><p>Likewise, there&apos;s no "workout" mode for kids who want to track their own health metrics during the day. It&apos;s a very set-it-and-forget-it kind of watch, which is both good and bad.</p><p>There are also no apps of any kind, unlike a full-fledged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>. That&apos;s not different from most kid-focused smartwatches, but it is a little surprising to see that Google and Fitbit don&apos;t at least have some kind of curated section of the Play Store for smartwatch apps for kids.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e" name="T-Mobile-SyncUP-KIDS-Watch-home-screen.jpg" alt="The T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nce9KSpEPau3bskCsUde6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/t-mobile-syncup-kids-watch-review">T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch</a> is my recommendation as the best alternative to the Fitbit Ace LTE for one main reason: video calling. There&apos;s something about being able to see your child on the other end of a call that gives you a boost of confidence, knowing you can see they&apos;re secure, not just hear it. Otherwise, lack of Wi-Fi and a requirement to use T-Mobile&apos;s network mean it&apos;s a worse buy for other reasons.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce</a> offers some similar fun activity tracking features but doesn&apos;t feature anywhere near the robust health metrics of the Fitbit Ace LTE. Of course, Fitbit doesn&apos;t give you most of this data, but it&apos;s still tracked via the points system. The Garmin Bounce has much better battery life than the Ace, though, making it a no-brainer for anyone who doesn&apos;t want to charge every day.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a powerful, fun, and easy-to-use smartwatch for kids.</li><li>You want a smartwatch for kids that looks like a grown-up watch.</li><li>Your kids love games and can be motivated by them to move more throughout the day.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't want to pay for a regular subscription.</li><li>You want more granular health tracking data.</li><li>Your kids need smartwatch apps.</li></ul>
<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE is a brilliant smartwatch for kids that is now my new favorite. The past year has delivered some truly excellent kids&apos; smartwatches, and this is the creme de la creme. It&apos;s got brilliant fitness tracking and motivational games to keep your kids moving—something I&apos;d expect from the Fitbit brand—and battery life long enough to work throughout the day.</p><p>My biggest complaint is that the watch is a little too simple on the parental control side of things. There&apos;s no way to adjust how much activity your kids need to unlock reward goals. While I appreciate the doctor-approved defaults, I prefer them to be just that — defaults that can be adjusted, not requirements.</p><p>But I can look past most of that because of the brilliance of the system and the overall polish of this product. This is a smartwatch for kids like no other. Everything from the sleek hardware to the slick software design is a notch above anything else out there. That doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t some other watches that might appeal to you or your kids more for one reason or another, but this one is going to be the best for most people.</p>

<ul><li>Ready at Dawn Studios, part of Oculus Studios, is closing permanently, effective immediately.</li><li>The studio produced some of the highest-rated VR games ever, including Lone Echo, Lone Echo 2, and Echo VR, as well as some PSP classics like God of War and Daxter.</li><li>Meta says that Ready at Dawn employees are encouraged to apply to other studios within the Oculus Studios umbrella.</li><li>The reduction was made to meet the new Reality Labs budgetary ceiling rather than as a proactive cost-saving initiative.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One of VR&apos;s greatest development studios is closing its doors permanently today (Aug. 7). Ready at Dawn Studios was behind the famed Echo VR and Lone Echo games, all of which received critical and customer acclaim. But the studio hasn&apos;t launched a new game since Echo VR was ported to Quest in May 2020, and it&apos;s likely sales of Lone Echo 2 could have played a part in the decision since that&apos;s a PCVR-only game.</p><p>Meta first made cuts to the studio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/your-favorite-oculus-quest-games-are-getting-canceled-heres-why">last February</a> when it announced it would shutter Echo VR despite still having a player count "in the low 10 thousands," as noted by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth at the time. It&apos;s worth noting that Meta just stated that Quest 3 sales are "exceeding their expectations" in the company&apos;s most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q2-2024-earnings">quarterly earnings call last week</a>.</p><p>One report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4-leaked-release-date">in mid-July</a> said that Meta was cutting its Reality Labs division&apos;s budget by 20% by 2026, and an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios — seen by Android Central — supports this reasoning. A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren&apos;t being made to "save money," per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a "better long-term impact" in VR development.</p><p>Meta also commented that this isn&apos;t a signal of wider cuts to the number of first-party games on Quest and that the company is still committed to VR development.</p>

<p>While Reality Labs has historically spent billions per quarter on development costs of XR hardware like the Meta Quest 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, VR games, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta AI features</a>, the company is starting to put a hard cap on that spending each quarter.</p><p>Ready at Dawn has been a part of Oculus Studios since June 2020, just a few weeks after Echo VR was ported to the original Oculus Quest. Meta says that Ready at Dawn employees are encouraged to apply elsewhere within Oculus Studios and that the company wants to retain as many talented developers as possible.</p><p>Meta also explains that while this move shutters the entire studio, it isn&apos;t enough to trigger the California WARN Act. The WARN Act requires companies to give employees notice ahead of time if more than 50 employees are laid off in a 30-day period. All employees will receive severance pay similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-may-2023-layoffs">previous rounds</a> of Meta layoffs.</p><p>Meta didn&apos;t provide a comment when asked about the possibility of Quest ports for Lone Echo or Lone Echo 2 by other Oculus Studios developers.</p>

<ul><li>A report states California is preparing to bring its state ID to Google Wallet's digital experience.</li><li>A simple set of steps will let users utilize their ID at "select" TSA terminals without needing California's specific digital wallet app.</li><li>Google was recently spotted testing a new Wallet feature that will let users store "everything else" like text-based documents.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s digital wallet is preparing to receive another state&apos;s ID as it continues to build up its support portfolio.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/05/google-wallet-california-id/">9to5Google</a>, the State of California is working on supporting a legal digital ID in Google Wallet at some point this year. The state has reportedly started testing support for Wallet among DMV employees and will likely extend this to regular civilians in the future. Early information suggests that adding the state&apos;s ID to Wallet will be straightforward.</p><p>Users can soon hop into Wallet&apos;s settings and tap "Add to Wallet." From there, tapping "ID Card" will inform users what&apos;s required to proceed.</p><p>The good news here is that it doesn&apos;t seem as though users will need California&apos;s created app, CA DMV Wallet, to use a digital ID. This should save users time as Wallet is typically available across all Android phones and can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">hold a majority of your bank cards</a>, credit cards, and more.</p><p>The digital state ID variant will let Californians use it at "select" terminals at SFO (San Francisco International Airport), SJC (San Jose International Airport), and LAX (Los Angeles International Airport).</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">Earlier this year</a>, Google&apos;s director of product management for Google Wallet, Dong Min Kim mentioned that "more states" will support digital IDs in the following months. There weren&apos;t any specifics discussed, however, it seems California will be among the new states enabling support. Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-ids-for-three-more-us-states">has supported</a> Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland IDs since 2023.</p><p>Digital wallets, specifically Google, have had some maneuvering to do considering support for state IDs requires a close working relationship with the state in question. Additionally, Kim states that Google wants to get Wallet to a point where folks can leave the physical version at home — but that&apos;s a far-off reality.</p><p>While digital IDs are useful for convenience, it&apos;s still recommended that people bring the physical version in case something goes wrong.</p><p>In other news, it was discovered that Google wants Wallet to help users store "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-everything-else-spotted">everything else</a>." An APK teardown showed the company&apos;s work to develop a text-based document scanning feature for student IDs, passports, and resident cards. Wallet will "automatically detect" whether your uploaded document is general or private and categorize it appropriately.</p>

<hr>
<p>Vivo&apos;s V-series is expanding with the new V40 Pro. Alongside it, the company is reintroducing the regular V40, which made its debut in June.</p><p>The two new models now both feature Zeiss-branded lenses and portrait shooting modes, potentially giving our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">favorite cheap Android phones</a> a run for their money.</p><p>Since 2020, Vivo has been collaborating with Zeiss, a move also seen with other major Chinese smartphone brands. Historically, this partnership was mostly exclusive to Vivo’s flagship models.</p><p>The Vivo-Zeiss imaging system first debuted with the X60 series. Earlier this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">Vivo V30 Pro</a> brought Zeiss to Vivo&apos;s mid-range lineup. Now, both models expanding on this with Zeiss optics and a versatile focal length range is a thrilling development.</p><p>The V40 series features a 50MP main camera with Zeiss optics and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on both models. For sharp detail, both phones use a large 1/1.156-inch sensor: the V40 Pro has the Sony IMX921, while the V40 sports the Samsung ISOCELL GNJ.</p><p>Both V40 models also come with a 50MP ZEISS ultra-wide camera, equipped with an f/2.0 aperture and autofocus tracking.</p><p>What sets the Pro model apart is its 50MP Zeiss telephoto camera featuring a Sony IMX816 sensor. It provides a 2x optical zoom and a 50x Zeiss-branded digital zoom. This setup allows the V40 Pro to cover focal lengths from 24mm to 100mm, thanks to a mix of optical and Zeiss-enhanced digital zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4V87c6wiDQ6oB5YGN2Xy9" name="Vivo-V40-Pro.jpg" alt="Vivo V40 Pro renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4V87c6wiDQ6oB5YGN2Xy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1810" height="1018" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Pro model, the V40 features focal lengths of 24mm, 35mm, and 50mm using its main and ultra-wide cameras. To elevate portrait shots, Vivo has added Zeiss Style Bokeh effects.</p><p>The V40 series keeps the signature LED fill light from previous V series models but now features the AI Aura Light Portrait. This revamped version is more compact and delivers three times the brightness at 2x zoom compared to the previous model, all while providing a soft light that&apos;s 50 times gentler than a standard flash.</p><p>Alongside the physical Aura Light, both models offer the AI 3D Studio Lighting feature. This tech uses advanced algorithms and facial recognition to mimic natural fill light in tricky conditions.</p>
<h2 id="upgraded-screen-brightness-and-reliable-chipsets-2">Upgraded screen brightness and reliable chipsets</h2>
<p>On the front, the V40 and V40 Pro feature a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 2800 x 1260 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 4500 nits, making visuals pop even in the sunniest conditions.</p><p>Under the hood, the V40 Pro runs on MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9200+ processor, while the V40 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC. Both models come with 12GB of base RAM, expandable by another 12GB.</p><p>The V40 series combines a lightweight design with a robust 5,500mAh battery, making it Vivo’s thinnest model with this capacity. To top it off, the phones support rapid 80W FlashCharge technology for quick recharges.</p><p>The Vivo V40 series is launching first in India, with global availability expected in the coming weeks. Vivo says that pricing, configurations, and availability will differ by region.</p>

So here&apos;s the deal: pick up the Pixel 8 Pro from Mint Mobile alongside any six-month data plan and the T-Mobile-owned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-8-pro/4367961/"><strong>carrier will give you a whopping $440 discount</strong></a><strong> </strong>AND six additional months of wireless for 100% free. </p><p>That&apos;s a discount of over 40% on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that money can buy, plus half off a year of wireless service from one of our all-time favorite MVNOs. And it&apos;s not like you&apos;re paying down a ridiculous amount of cash to become eligible, either: this bundle offer starts as low as $649 for BOTH the phone and the full year of wireless, or $55 per month when you pay through Affirm. </p>

<p>This offer is essentially one of our favorite phones teaming up with one of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers,</a> so of course we're going to get excited.

<p>The offer has been around for most of the year, but if past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> are any indication, you can expect it to finally expire once Google&apos;s newest flagship phones get revealed next week. The bright side is that we <em>might</em> see a similar, albeit lesser, deal on the Pixel 9 Pro when it finally hits store shelves, but only time will tell.</p><p>We once gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> the title of "King of the Androids", thanks to its sophisticated balance of gorgeous design choices and premium specs. The flagship boasts the efficiency of Google&apos;s proprietary Tensor G3 chipset, plus you get outstanding haptics, seven years of software support, and all of the cutting-edge camera technology that has become synonymous with the Pixel brand.</p><p>Powered by T-Mobile, Mint is a popular prepaid carrier that provides affordable wireless by selling service in 3, 6, or 12-month increments of time. There are four data options available, ranging from 5GB per month to an unlimited plan capped at 40GB per month before speeds slow. All plans come with unlimited talk and text, plus you get free calls to Mexico and Canada and a mobile hotspot. Pair the company&apos;s straightforward approach to wireless with deals like this, and it&apos;s no wonder we called Mint one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">best wireless carriers</a> in the biz. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Google TV Streamer's processor details are still under wraps, but it’s rumored to be the MediaTek MT8696, similar to the chip in Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K Max.</li><li>The new streaming device significantly upgrades RAM and storage to 4GB and 32GB, a big leap from the old model’s 8GB.</li><li>It uses the Google TV interface, supports a range of TV apps, integrates with Google Home and Nest, and serves as a Matter smart home hub and Thread border router.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s back in the high-end streaming scene <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">with its new Google TV Streamer</a>, offering 4K, smart home integration, and a wide app selection. Surprisingly, it may be using a different processor than expected.</p><p>Even after unveiling the Chromecast replacement, Google has kept the TV Streamer’s processor details under wraps. The company only promises an "improved" chipset but hasn&apos;t revealed the manufacturer or model.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-processor-3468418/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> recently discovered that the mysterious processor is the MediaTek MT8696. Although details are limited, this chip seems to be a variant of the one in Amazon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review-obnoxious-ads-ruin-fun">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. This suggests support for advanced video codecs like AV1, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+, matching the TV Streamer&apos;s features.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Google for a comment on the streaming device&apos;s chipset and will update this article once we receive a response.</p><p>If accurate, Google&apos;s choice of a MediaTek chipset for the Google TV Streamer signals a shift from its previous reliance on Amlogic processors. The 2020 4K and 2022 HD Chromecast models used Amlogic&apos;s S905X3 and S805X2 SoCs, respectively.</p><p>MediaTek has been tight-lipped about the MT8696 processor&apos;s specs, including its clock speed. However, by looking at the similar MT8696(T) chipset in Amazon&apos;s Fire TV Stick, we can guess some performance details. Amazon&apos;s version has a quad-core CPU running up to 2.0GHz, giving us an idea of the Google TV Streamer&apos;s potential processing power.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Amlogic processors in previous Chromecast models maxed out at 1.9GHz. This implies the MediaTek chipset could offer a performance boost, though we&apos;ll need official specs from MediaTek to confirm.</p><p>Anyway, the Google TV Streamer solves a major Chromecast shortcoming with a big upgrade in RAM and storage. It comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, a huge leap from the previous model’s 8GB.</p><p>The box also uses the familiar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> interface (formerly Android TV) to give access to a wide range of TV apps from the Google Play Store. It integrates smoothly with Google Home and Nest smart home systems. Plus, it acts as a Matter smart home hub and Thread border router, making it a key control center for your connected home devices.</p><p>In any case, switching from Amlogic to MediaTek for Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming devices</a> makes sense given their leading roles in the TV chip market.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I wasn&apos;t keen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> when it launched back in October 2023; while the design was terrific, the software wasn&apos;t polished out of the box, and it was irksome to use. But I went back to the device following an update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and it was an entirely different beast. In fact, it was so good I ended up using the device as my primary phone for several months, and nearly a year after its release, it continues to be one of the best around.</p><p>This would be the time when OnePlus normally released a new model, but the Chinese manufacturer is doing things differently in 2024. Instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">Open 2</a>, the company is introducing a new version of the foldable with a few tweaks, dubbed the OnePlus Open Apex Edition. This particular model comes in a gorgeous new Crimson Shadow color variant, gets 1TB of storage as standard, and includes a dedicated security chip that&apos;s similar to what Google offers on its Pixels.</p><p>Essentially, the Open Apex Edition inherits the same great features as the regular model: a gorgeous design, terrific cameras, smooth hinge with a crease that isn&apos;t noticeable, and decent battery life. On the flip side, it retains all of the foldable&apos;s foibles; it won&apos;t get as many updates, there&apos;s no meaningful water resistance, and it misses out on the latest hardware.</p><p>Is the Open Apex Edition a worthy choice against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a>? Let&apos;s take a look.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-pricing-and-availability"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Pricing and availability </span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Vt9d39yGn73ZWWxKmsURiV" name="oneplus-open-2024-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vt9d39yGn73ZWWxKmsURiV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus unveiled the Open Apex Edition on August 7, and the foldable is now on sale in all regions where the standard model debuted last year, including India, the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It is available in a single variant with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and it costs $1,899 in the U.S. and ₹1,49,999 ($1,786) in India.</p><p>It isn&apos;t as good a value in the U.S. — particularly considering there&apos;s no carrier backing — but it is a decent showing in India. Vivo&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a> is available in the country for ₹1,59,999 ($1,910), and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> retails for ₹1,76,999 ($2,112). OnePlus managed to undercut both of these devices, and while the hardware isn&apos;t the latest, it still holds up incredibly well in 2024.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-design"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX" name="oneplus-open-2024-18.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eGyLKviAK3wq4uCoqV8HdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It goes without saying that the most striking feature of the OnePlus Open Apex Edition is the color. Officially dubbed Crimson Shadow, this burgundy red color is exquisite, and it attracts attention a lot better than the regular Voyager Black model. OnePlus went with the same faux leather finish at the back, and that&apos;s a good choice — it is much better to hold and use than a standard glass pane.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U" name="oneplus-open-2024-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQxSSYtjCKrE74bFidfA8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The switch to a bold red hue makes the camera island that much more distinctive, and this in part because of the matte red band that encircles the outside of the housing. OnePlus says the design of the camera housing is meant to mimic luxury watches, and that is evident. The cameras within the housing are slotted within individual rings, and the stylized Hasselblad logo is on the right.</p>

<p>The overall design is elegant, and the red leather back contrasts well with the polished metal sides. OnePlus says the red hue used on the device is an homage to Hasselblad&apos;s 503CW 60 Years Victor Red Edition, and while I don&apos;t know anything about that camera, I can say that the hue looks really good on the phone, and it gives it a lot of character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pchZxFFcqcq5cbbSHCAMKX" name="oneplus-open-2024-17.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pchZxFFcqcq5cbbSHCAMKX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the biggest positives on the design front is the size; the foldable is shorter than its immediate rivals, and that makes using it much more comfortable. The cover screen in particular is a delight to use, and most of the time, I didn&apos;t have to unfold the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TsvP2Pi2rnsEdAgkoakAuY" name="oneplus-open-2024-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TsvP2Pi2rnsEdAgkoakAuY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The chassis of the Open Apex Edition is made out of the same combination of cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium alloys, and it ends up being lighter and more durable than steel. It has the same 239g weight as the standard model, and while that&apos;s on the lower end of the scale, it isn&apos;t the thinnest or lightest foldable around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV" name="oneplus-open-2024-7.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VEqQ3Ah5DyuAJhYnx4yVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo&apos;s X Fold3 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Honor Magic V2</a> (and the upcoming V3), Xiaomi&apos;s Mix Fold 4 are all thinner and lighter than what OnePlus is offering, and even Samsung managed to bring the weight of the Z Fold 6 down to the same as the Open. OnePlus clearly had the edge in this regard when the Open debuted, but a year of innovation in this area means it doesn&apos;t have an advantage anymore.</p>
<p>That said, the hinge is still one of the best around, and switching from the X Fold3 Pro, there were no issues. It has a smooth articulation, doesn&apos;t need much force to open, and if my usage of the standard model is anything to go by, it is clearly built to last. The alert slider is also intact, and it picks up a new VIP mode. The slider itself has been redesigned and features a better texture and an orange accent that makes it stand out just a bit more than the one on the regular model.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-hardware"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Hardware</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wrHv7wvnPKQsJ4tqnNZ93X" name="oneplus-open-2024-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrHv7wvnPKQsJ4tqnNZ93X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus isn&apos;t making many changes to the hardware itself, so I&apos;m not going to spend too much time talking about it. The Open Apex Edition has the same 6.31-inch cover screen and a 7.82-inch inner panel as the standard model. Both AMOLED panels go up to 120Hz, offer Dolby Vision, and use LTPO 3.0 to dynamically adjust the refresh according to content on the screen.</p><p>You get vibrant colors and excellent contrast levels, and the same level of customizability as the OnePlus 12. I didn&apos;t see any issues in outdoor use, and the foldable has adequate brightness levels. Built-in sound is great too, and it is among the loudest in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX" name="oneplus-open-2024-20.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dXEAa8WVpZvUdAtztpADwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the internals, the Open Apex Edition is powered by last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Its still just as fluid and performant as the 8 Gen 3, but it doesn&apos;t quite manage to deliver the same efficiency figures, and that&apos;s evident in the battery life. I still managed to get a day&apos;s worth of use consistently between charges, but with heavy use, you will need to plug in the device before turning in for the night.</p><p>It uses the same 80W charging tech, and it takes just over 45 minutes to fully charge the 4805mAh battery. With the latest slate of foldables offering bigger batteries, the Open no longer has the edge in this area. That said, you don&apos;t miss out in terms of connectivity, with the device offering global 5G bands, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, USB-C 3.1, and the entire suite of AptX codecs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ" name="oneplus-open-2024-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nYakyXauxUpCJjCEZvMSBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1963" height="1106" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest difference with the Open Apex Edition is the storage; the foldable now comes with 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and that&apos;s in line with the highest-storage variant of the Magic V2 and Z Fold 6. You still get 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and in my use, there wasn&apos;t any scenario where I felt the RAM wasn&apos;t adequate.</p><p>Also new is a Goodix GSEA0 security chip that is powered by Arm&apos;s SecurCore SC300 platform. This chip debuted in last year&apos;s Find N3, and with the commingling of OnePlus and OPPO, it is now making its way to the Open. The chip oversees the VIP mode that limits access to the mic and camera, and while its efficacy may be limited in daily use, it is a novel addition nonetheless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU" name="oneplus-open-2024-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3iePL45GuS8bkhXuYCiNU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out the hardware, the Open Apex Edition has the same cameras: a 48MP main camera based on Sony&apos;s LYT-T808 module, a 64MP OmniVision OV64B telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 48MP wide-angle lens that uses the Sony IMX581. There&apos;s a 32MP camera on the cover panel, and a 20MP module on the inside.</p><p>While the camera hardware hasn&apos;t changed, OnePlus rolled out a series of updates to the phone over the course of the last year, and they make a sizeable difference in the caliber of photos and videos. I still prefer the X Fold3 Pro, but there&apos;s no arguing the Open is a close second, and it easily outshines the Z Fold 6.</p>
<p>That&apos;s true in other areas as well. Although the hardware isn&apos;t the latest available, the Open Apex Edition holds its own in demanding games, and I didn&apos;t see any lag or slowdowns whatsoever. It would have been nice to get the 8 Gen 3, but the 8 Gen 2 still has plenty to offer.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-software"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: Software</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW" name="oneplus-open-2024-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozwGNvUL9zyb7SM8snz8oW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like the most about the Open Apex Edition is that it has one of the best multi-tasking capabilities of any foldable today, with OnePlus adding a ton of utilities to maximize the available real estate. It&apos;s incredibly easy to launch split-screen mode, and you get the ability to stack windows and change orientation without any hassle.</p><p>The foldable runs OxygenOS 14.1 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and while the interface is similar to OxygenOS 14, there are new AI-based image editing features similar to Magic Eraser on the Pixels. The interface is fluid and doesn&apos;t have any lag or slowdowns, and there&apos;s extensive customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TR7ufYfepyXHKyFhpQUnGV" name="oneplus-open-2024-6.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TR7ufYfepyXHKyFhpQUnGV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest change in this area has to do with the alert slider; you still get the ability to switch between ring and silent profiles, and there&apos;s now a new VIP mode that&apos;s designed to safeguard your privacy. In this mode, app access to the mic and camera is disabled, and no app is allowed to take photos, videos, or record audio.</p><p>You can still use the camera to take photos and videos in this mode and share them within an app like Instagram or WhatsApp, but if you want to access the viewfinder within Instagram, that isn&apos;t possible. You&apos;ll get a dialog box stating that camera access is disabled, and you&apos;ll need to exit the VIP mode to be able to use it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY" name="oneplus-open-2024-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open Apex Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4aNfnwyja9Ag9HUzaN8KRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The feature made its debut in the Chinese build of ColorOS at the start of the year, and I put it to good use on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>; with OxygenOS differing in name only, it&apos;s no wonder that OnePlus is adding this feature to its devices. That said, I don&apos;t think it deserves a slot on the alert slider; it isn&apos;t something that most users need (or would consider using), and it would have been better to include it as a tile in the notification pane.</p><p>Now, the main problem with the foldable is that it won&apos;t get long-term software updates. OnePlus is guaranteeing three Android OS updates and four years of security updates — same as the standard model. That just isn&apos;t enough in 2024, and what&apos;s particularly annoying is that the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> is slated to get more software updates than the Open Apex Edition. The Nord 4 will pick up the Android 18 update, while the Open won&apos;t go beyond Android 17.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-open-apex-edition-the-competition"><span>OnePlus Open Apex Edition: The competition</span></h2>

<p>Obviously, Samsung isn&apos;t a contender this year, and the Z Fold 6 doesn&apos;t really have anything meaningful to offer. But Vivo&apos;s X Fold3 Pro is thinner, lighter, has better cameras, and is more powerful than the Open Apex Edition. The biggest differentiation is the battery life, with Vivo&apos;s foldable able to last well over a day even with heavy use.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a foldable that's easy to hold and use</li><li>You need good cameras</li><li>You want meaningful software extras</li><li>You want an elegant design</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want long-term software updates</li><li>You need the latest hardware</li><li>You want the best battery life</li></ul>
<p>With the Open Apex Edition, OnePlus is showing that it doesn&apos;t need to release a new phone yearly to stay relevant. Other manufacturers should consider going the same route, because at the end of the day, the Open still has a lot going for it, and it holds up well against its 2024 rivals.</p><p>The only issue with the foldable is the lack of long-term updates; OnePlus needs to roll out more updates to the phone, because as it stands, it is outmatched by the Nord 4, which costs four times less. As I&apos;m picking out flaws, IPX4 water resistance doesn&apos;t measure up in 2024, and with other foldables now offering IPX8 as standard, the Open is on the backfoot.</p><p>Outside of that, I can&apos;t really find any faults with the foldable. It has a ton of useful multitasking features, the design is easily one of the best — if not the best — and the burgundy red color option is utterly gorgeous. If you care about the design and want a foldable that looks as well as it performs, the Open Apex Edition is a great choice in 2024 and beyond.</p>
