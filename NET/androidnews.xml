<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>There are indications that Samsung might introduce a vertical scroll option for the app drawer in the next version of One UI.</li><li>Good Lock's Home Up module used to allow customization of the app drawer layout, but Samsung removed this option in recent updates.</li><li>Samsung might be planning to integrate a "vertical list function" directly into the OS instead of relying on Good Lock.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s app drawer has always swiped sideways, unlike most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that scroll up and down. But it looks like Samsung might be jumping on the vertical scroll bandwagon at last.</p><p>Apparently, the official word from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>&apos;s development team is that the next version of One UI will include a vertical scrolling option for the app drawer, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-7-vertical-app-drawer-hint/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>This juicy detail came out when a Samsung representative was responding to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-z/goodlock%EA%B8%B0%EB%8A%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EC%95%B1%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4%EC%9D%84-%EC%84%B8%EB%A1%9C-%EB%A6%AC%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A1%9C-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95%EC%9D%B4-%EC%9E%88%EC%97%88%EB%8B%A4%EA%B3%A0%EB%8A%94-%EB%93%A4%EC%97%88%EB%8A%94%EB%8D%B0%EC%9A%94/m-p/26524885/highlight/true#M156631" target="_blank">user&apos;s query</a> about the possibility of bringing back that feature in Good Lock&apos;s Home Up module.</p><p>Right now, One UI&apos;s app drawer organizes apps into pages, so you have to swipe left or right to move around. However, Home Up used to be the go-to for customizing the One UI home screen, including switching the app drawer to a vertical scroll layout. But in recent updates, Samsung took that option out of the module.</p><p>In a comment on Samsung’s forums, a member of the Good Lock support team shed some light on why the feature got axed. Apparently, Samsung is cooking up a "vertical list function" to be supported in the next OS version instead of relying on Good Lock.</p><p>While Samsung might just bring back the vertical scroll option in Good Lock, it&apos;s more probable that the moderator is hinting at native support for vertical app drawers being added to the OS with the release of One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Samsung has been known for doing things its own way on Android. Take seamless updates, for instance—the company has been avoiding them for ages. But in March, the South Korean tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-a55-seemingly-adopting-seamless-updates">finally gave in and started rolling out the feature</a>.</p><p>Now, it looks like another user-requested feature for Samsung phones might be on the horizon—a feature most other Android users already have.</p><p>We&apos;ll have to wait and see until Samsung&apos;s Android 15 update, One UI 7, hits the beta stage, which is still a few months down the road.</p>

Completely apropos of nothing, Amazon has decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Speakers-Upgraded-Graphite/dp/B0CLF3VPMV"><strong>carve a historic 27% off</strong></a> the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, a versatile tablet that boasts an elegant aluminum-and-glass construction, efficient performance from a Snapdragon chip, and a 7,040mAh battery that you can rely on. </p>

<p>Head to Amazon today and you can grab the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus for only $159.99 (for the 64GB version) or $209.99 (128GB version). Either way, you're getting a record low price on a popular Samsung slab that features great battery life with fast charging, quad Dolby Atmos speakers, and expandable storage up to 1TB via microSD. </p>
<p>The tablet doesn't support the S Pen stylus and there's no water resistance rating, but aside from those flaws, the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is pretty much the perfect couch companion, and right now it's selling at a low price that we've never seen before. <em><strong>This deal could expire at any moment, so don't wait if you're interested.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a tablet with great battery life and reliably-fast performance; your budget is under $250; you just need something simple for streaming, reading, and browsing the web. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want to use a stylus with your tablet; you can afford a more premium device; you need something for serious gaming; you want a device with a water resistance rating. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus scored the top spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">best cheap Android tablets</a> that money can buy, mainly because it has just about every feature you could want in a modern tablet at a considerably lower cost. The 64GB version of the slab typically retails for around $219.99, but thanks to this record-smashing discount, you can grab the A9 Plus for a mere $159.99.</p><p>Unlike most tablets in this price range, there are honestly very few drawbacks with the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. Perhaps the biggest issue here is the lack of S Pen stylus support, so if you like to draw or physically write notes on your tablet, you should probably look elsewhere. And sure, if you can spend more, there are certainly more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> out there (the Tab S9 Series immediately comes to mind), but if you&apos;re trying to save a little cash without skimping on useful features, this Galaxy Tab A9 Plus deal is a no-brainer. </p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is starting its "staggered" rollout of its OS 2.5.5 update for the latest Phone 2 flagship.</p><p>As detailed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/9058-nothing-os-255-rolling-out-for-phone-2">Nothing</a>, the OS 2.5.5 update brings the company&apos;s integration of OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT software. The rollout brings a new gesture users can find in Nothing X that lets them begin a voice conversation via the recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-nothing-ear-and-ear-a-earbuds-promise-better-battery-and-super-clear-streaming">Ear and Ear (a)</a> devices. The post adds that support for this feature is "coming soon" for Nothing&apos;s other audio products.</p><p>Version 2.5.5 also brings a new ChatGPT widget for the home screen that will let users launch the AI bot in "different modes." A new button has been added to screenshots and the clipboard that lets users pop its contents directly into ChatGPT.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> is picking up several features, beginning with Ultra XDR within the camera settings. The camera app now displays an HDR switcher for its Photo and Portrait modes.</p><p>Other features include a RAM booster within the system settings, a Ring mode option for sounds, and a new Recorder widget. Users are gaining a battery widget, which Nothing hopes will help better manage the device&apos;s power.</p><p>The changelog states the following bug fixes round out the patch:</p>
<ul><li>Enhanced system stability, NFC functionality, and Wi-Fi connection stability.</li><li>Optimised animations for smoother widget and app openings.</li><li>Improved clarity of album cover display in the Music Player widget.</li><li>Resolved flickering when launching apps from Quick Settings on the lock screen.</li><li>Resolved flickering issues on the AOD interface.</li><li>Addressed abnormal lock screen wallpaper display when swiping-to-unlock is interrupted.</li></ul>

<p>As previously stated, the Nothing OS 2.5.5 update is rolling out in a staggered manner to all Phone 2 owners. The company states that while every user will not see the update simultaneously, it allows them to catch problems if they arise.</p><p>The latest update arrives two weeks after the Phone picked up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-dot-5-dot-3-update-to-phone-2">2.5.3 update</a>, which included Nothing&apos;s April 2024 security patch. The update brought better icon organization while scrolling through pages. System stability and improvements to the device&apos;s animations were among the update&apos;s notes, as well. Curiously, it seems there&apos;s more to do with the Phone 2&apos;s animations, as the 2.5.5 update brings in more tweaks.</p><p>The latest Nothing OS update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2a-receives-april-2024-security-patch">arrived on the mid-range</a> Phone 2a on April 16. The device picked up camera changes that should help its color saturation, better optimization for blur accuracy, and overall clarity.</p>

<ul><li>Sony's Japanese website teases the "Xperia Special Event 2024" in Tokyo, Japan on May 17.</li><li>The name alone seems to tease a new Xperia launch, and a "product experience" is also listed in the schedule, furthering this suspicion.</li><li>Sony has yet to announce a launch for the Xperia 1 VI, however, its predecessor was revealed in May 2023, so there's a possibility for the same this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sony has started teasing a reveal regarding its Xperia flagship phone series as an event in May could hold its official launch.</p><p>Sony launched a new event <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.jp/xperia/special/event/xse2024spring/">splash page</a> promoting the "Xperia Special Event 2024," which is set for May 17 in Tokyo, Japan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/18/sony-could-launch-the-xperia-1-vi-at-may-17-event/">9to5Google</a>). The details (machine translated) state "Xperia developers introduce the latest features" and that consumers can join in to see them in person.</p><p>The company highlights the event&apos;s itinerary, starting with a reception and then a welcome speech before rolling into a "product experience." While it&apos;s likely that this portion will reveal what "new features" Sony has in store for its Xperia line, it could also reveal its next flagship: the Xperia 1 VI.</p><p>Sony states that the event is limited to 100 people in Japan, and people have until April 30 to apply for a seat in the crowd.</p><p>Sony has yet to announce the existence of the Xperia 1 VI formally, but we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a> to look back on. Last year&apos;s device, aimed at content creators, launched around May 11 — which is close to this year&apos;s planned "Xperia" event in Japan.</p><p>It&apos;s cause for excitement, but nothing is set in stone, so we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Rumors have surfaced regarding the upcoming flagship entry, with some suggesting it could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors">drop in display quality</a>. It was stated that the Xperia 1 VI could lose its 4K resolution display in favor of a "2K Plus" or "Quad HD Plus" panel. The former is what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-5-v-launch">Xperia 5 series</a> sports, which is usually seen as an alternative consumers can look to instead of the flagship Xperia 1 series.</p><p>More recently, supposed Xperia 1 VI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xperia-1-vi-renders-have-leaked">renders leaked</a>, and give us a look at an alleged change to its aspect ratio. The device seems to opt for a 19.5:9 ratio instead of the taller 21:9 ratio that the 1 V features. The renderings suggest Sony will continue its boxy design for the phone alongside a vertical triple camera array on the back panel.</p>

<p>The concept itself is interesting enough, but this story wouldn&apos;t be nearly as intriguing if it weren&apos;t presented the right way. There&apos;s no denying the importance and influence of a person like Cheng Shih, who helped push women&apos;s rights forward in her own unique way. But this story, among others in page after page of a boring history book, simply wouldn&apos;t hold the same weight — it certainly never did for me when I was in school!</p><p>That&apos;s why Meta Quest games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5420468924659233/">The Pirate Queen</a> are the future of education. The story of Cheng Shih in The Pirate Queen, which is brought to life by Singer Films Limited & Singer Interactive Limited and award-winning actress Lucy Liu, is one of historical significance, and the main plot points in the game are based on known events. What takes place in between is classic historical fiction, but that&apos;s what made me love the title so much.</p><p>The difference between a historical fiction book — my favorite genre, by the way — and a game like this is being able to experience these events <em>for myself</em>. That first-hand experience not only made them feel real, it made them memorable. That, in and of itself, is the key to why this sort of experience is so important for education.</p>

<p>Meta recently announced that it would begin a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/new-education-product-for-quest-devices/">VR for education initiative</a>, aiming to take off this Fall when school begins anew. The program is designed to provide access to "a range of education-specific apps and features" for teachers, trainers, and school administrators.</p><p>Based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/JerryUddanelse/status/1779965524161769863">my short interaction</a> with Jerry Jackson, a high school teacher who currently uses a suite of Meta Quest 3 headsets in his classroom, it&apos;s about time Meta began focusing on using Quest headsets in schools like Google uses Chromebooks. The forefront of this new program seems to deal with managing multiple Quest devices at once, something Jackson says is sorely needed.</p><p>Meta says its new program will allow teachers to skip the need to prepare headsets individually, allowing students to "pick up the headset and get started right away."</p><p>But what about the content itself? I think titles like The Pirate Queen could play a pivotal role in helping students better understand and empathize with historical characters from all walks of life.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Shruti Shekar and I had the opportunity to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sites.libsyn.com/23914/the-pirate-queen-interview-with-lucy-liu-eloise-singer">interview Lucy Liu and Eloise Singer</a> as part of the Android Central Podcast. We discussed how the group got started on the idea of The Pirate Queen, how the story became a VR game before it started being made into a movie, and how VR experiences can be used to help you feel and understand the personal plight of another human being.</p>

<p>My life experience has often been one with little discrimination or hardship. While I consider myself a compassionate individual, there&apos;s only <em>so much</em> I can do to truly empathize with stories of humans who have struggled throughout history. But VR can at least help me do better by putting me in the shoes of a person and having me live out at least a small portion of their life.</p><p>In 2019, Felix & Paul Studios published an immersive film called Traveling While Black. You can watch it for free on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/1931356740318898">Meta Quest TV app</a>, along with plenty of other films, and it&apos;ll take less than 20 minutes of your time.</p><p>This film was the first time I experienced the feelings that come with first-person immersion into another person&apos;s story. Yet, it&apos;s still mainly told from the perspective of a person sitting and talking to another person. I imagine it would have been an even more powerful story if I had actually seen it through the eyes of one of the people.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The game focuses entirely on the female lead character and her struggles, creating a "whole new genre" for pirates in the entertainment space.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Eloise Singer, the game&apos;s director, told us that "female hands didn&apos;t exist in VR at the time that we started developing the game." Since then, we&apos;ve seen some prominent female roles appear in VR — the foremost is Half-Life: Alyx, of course — but most of Alyx&apos;s hands are covered in gravity gloves.</p><p>In The Pirate Queen, Cheng Shih&apos;s hands are fully modeled to look like female hands, including rings and adorning jewelry that make her feel like a pirate. Initially, Singer and the rest of the development team were told that including hands that looked so feminine would keep male players from wanting to play the game.</p><p>Ridiculous sounding or not, the fact that any sort of pushback happened at all speaks volumes about the "disparity of what people think they want and what people are willing to try," as Liu put it. She notes that "only about 20% of games feature female leads," despite statistics showing that females make up roughly half of the gaming population.</p>

<p>The Pirate Queen is immersive in a different way, but it still attempts to tell the story of discrimination against a group of people. Women&apos;s rights were nary a concern among the men who ran society at the time, and even among lawless pirates, it doesn&apos;t seem many were convinced that a woman could be in charge of a fleet of hundreds of ships.</p><p>The game takes around two hours to beat and focuses solely on the night that Cheng Shih came to power. As Lucy Liu told us in the interview, "It&apos;s not one of those shoot-em-up kind of games." This is more of a narrative adventure designed for people who appreciate immersive narratives. It&apos;s not a game that&apos;s going to appeal to someone looking for nonstop action or addictive gameplay loops.</p><p>As such, I&apos;d recommend taking your time in each of the game&apos;s thirteen chapters. Walk and look around each room and pick up the objects on the shelves and in the cabinets. Take a moment to listen to Lucy Liu&apos;s brilliant narration of the tale. If you do, I promise you&apos;ll learn something you&apos;ve never known.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It&apos;s these moments that really make the adventure shine, and it&apos;s important to know what you&apos;re getting. This is essentially a feature-length film packaged in an interactive way. You&apos;ll not only be learning about Cheng Shih&apos;s story — a woman also known as Zheng Yi Sao, which means "Wife of Zheng Yi" — but about Chinese history and the women who may have gone unnoticed during that time.</p><p>As director Eloise Singer said, "you are literally stepping into the shoes of The Pirate Queen."</p>

<p>For instance, I knew about the horrific practice of bound feet but never quite grasped how small one of these boots was until I played the game. Picking one up from the table, I originally thought it might be a tea cup or something similar. Imagine the horror when I found out a woman&apos;s feet might have to fit inside.</p><p>So many objects scattered throughout the story have substantial meaning that delivers an important historical narrative and context that I might otherwise not appreciate if I weren&apos;t holding them in my hands. Surprisingly, the impact of these stories wasn&apos;t reduced despite the lackluster visual quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I enjoyed the escape room-style puzzles and the subtle hints when I got stuck.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I also appreciated the light escape room-style gameplay design here. I&apos;m a person who <em>loves</em> puzzle games and jumps at the chance to enjoy one whenever I can. Most of the rooms were simple, and I often solved the puzzles before Ms. Liu&apos;s narrative finished, but there were a few times when I wasn&apos;t sure how to progress, and the game gently nudged me to the right item.</p><p>These cleverly placed whisps of smoke or rattling doors felt like they fit well into the narrative instead of providing a giant glowing arrow to help me brainlessly meander to the next room.</p><p>After all, a game like The Pirate Queen isn&apos;t designed to be finished quickly. It&apos;s designed to be savored and appreciated.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ttrdsQbB9RDtPa5Msgf3SU" name="sora-schools-vr-davinci.jpg" alt="Sora schools' VR education apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttrdsQbB9RDtPa5Msgf3SU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sora schools)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many parents who were forced to enroll in virtual school during COVID will tell you that hands-on education is generally better than staring at a laptop for hours on end. Virtual school works quite well for some students but is a very poor choice for others when done on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>But if more kids had access to quality VR curriculum, I believe the idea of virtual schooling could be turned on its head. Just as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-are-chores-more-fun-in-vr">gamification of chores</a> makes them more fun, the gamification of education — providing incentives to encourage progression — is probably the best way to make it enjoyable.</p><p>I had a chat with Garrett Smiley, CEO of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://soraschools.com/">Sora Schools</a>, who talked to me briefly about how the school is working to implement a VR curriculum into its virtual-only school structure.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU" name="sora-schools-vr-curriculum.jpg" alt="Sora schools' VR education apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BTfMDxqTJs8SobZv5C9GpU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sora schools)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I&apos;m not sure the school is currently allowing students to play through interactive narratives like The Pirate Queen, the examples I was given seem far more convincing than watching someone teach through a Zoom meeting on a flat display.</p><p>Smiley was quick to note that most of his school&apos;s VR curriculum was optional and supplemental but nonetheless intriguing and truly interesting.</p><p>"At Sora, we&apos;re super excited about how VR and AR are shaking things up in the world of learning," Smiley told me in the interview. "In the next few years, this technology will no longer be a dream but an everyday reality. These gadgets are getting cheaper and more powerful, so they will be accessible to more people.<br>
<br>
We&apos;re on a continuous mission to make learning interesting. Imagine diving into our Sora Catalog of Expeditions and feeling like you&apos;re there. Whether you&apos;re learning from historical characters, diving deep into the ocean, or even walking on Mars, we&apos;re all about making it fun, interactive, and igniting curiosity in students."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Seeing is believing, and being able to hold something in your hands makes it even more memorable and personal.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Thankfully, those of us with VR headsets don&apos;t have to wait to experience great content that can <em>also</em> be educational. My very first room-scale VR experience was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/984294025016007/">the Blu</a> by WEVR. I played it on an HTC Vive at IFA 2015 in Belin and was blown away at the true size of a blue whale that swam over my head. You can play it today with a decent gaming PC capable of VR.</p><p>Games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/7146257325418969">Terra Alia</a> take the gamification of education in a literal sense, dropping you into an RPG that teaches you a new language. This one is also a bit short, but the developers are working on updates and more content that&apos;ll be added free of charge.</p><p>Thankfully, the multiplayer beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraAlia/comments/1biu38c/get_ready_to_level_up_your_language_skills_with/"><em>just launched</em></a>, showing that the developers are serious about keeping the game updated and relevant.</p><p>Even the environments and ships you&apos;ll be on in The Pirate Queen are realistically recreated. Singer told us that "every ship was designed to be historically accurate." After the team had originally started modeling the ships with wood and nails, it was learned that ships in China at the time only used dovetail joints. That meant everything had to be redesigned, but it also ensured the game ended up being more historically accurate.</p><p>Seeing is believing, and being able to hold something in your hands makes it even more memorable and personal. Titles like these help people learn better, feel more empathetic toward historical figures and events, and make education fun. It&apos;s a win-win for everyone involved, and I encourage you to give these titles a try!</p>

<ul><li>Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, wrote a letter to its staff, detailing the company's internal reorganization of several teams.</li><li>The restructuring births the "Platform and Devices" team, which sees Google's Android and hardware teams under one roof.</li><li>Joining the team will be its research and computational teams to help further Google's on-device AI software on its products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s CEO Sundar Pichai announced the beginning of restructuring at the company on Thursday.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/building-ai-future-april-2024/">a note submitted by Pichai</a>, the restructuring process will arrive in four parts, but the company&apos;s newly announced "Platforms and Devices" team spells a major shift for Google. The note reads, "To truly drive computing forward, we need to do it at the intersection of hardware, software, and AI."</p><p>This means that Google is merging its Pixel hardware and Android software teams.</p><p>Google&apos;s Rick Osterloh will be at the helm of this new team, overseeing the delivery of "higher quality products and experiences" for the user and company partners. Pichai likens such a goal to what the company did with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> and its initial arrival on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series. Google is also interested in giving a notable boost to Android and Chrome through this team merger.</p><p>Joining the Platform and Devices team will be Google&apos;s other research teams that focus on computational photography and on-device intelligence. Pichai states this move will bring a "deep AI experience" across Google&apos;s devices and its platforms. Additionally, merging teams under one roof should help "speed up decision-making."</p><p>Pichai announced that Sameer Samat, vice president of product management and Android, will rise to lead Android&apos;s entire ecosystem. Hiroshi Lockheimer, longtime Android lead, will act as an adviser during the transition before kickstarting a new executive sponsor role for Google in Japan.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s internal restructuring continues as the company looks to put its AI model Gemini on the fast track with a new team merger. Pichai states the company will consolidate teams responsible for building the models necessary for Research and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-deepmind-combined-team">Google DeepMind</a>. This is said to help simplify the development process behind compute-intensive models while also scaling Google&apos;s capability to deliver AI to everyone.</p><p>Google&apos;s AI research merge will gain a third member via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">Responsible AI</a> team. These folks are tasked with ensuring the company&apos;s AI products are "trustworthy and transparent." With them now housed together with the teams creating such products, Google hopes this will encourage "clearer responsibility and accountability."</p><p>It&apos;ll be worth keeping an eye on how Google pairs its Pixel products with its AI software, as both teams are now one. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> series already features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">deep pairing</a> with the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> model for on-device tasks and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series will likely continue this trend, and this new "Platform and Devices" team will likely influence it. For now, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-io-2024-puzzle">Google&apos;s annual I/O event</a>, which should take place in May, where we might hear more.</p>

The app is similar in functionality to Instagram with some of TikTok&apos;s theming and exclusive features.</p><p>For now, TikTok says that Notes is available "for download and limited testing in Australia and Canada."</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.spark&gl=ca" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/tiktok-notes/id6476737806" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a> listings for TikTok Notes, we can get a glimpse at the app&apos;s core functionality. TikTok users can sign into Notes with the same account they have for the video-sharing platform. Additionally, in a push notification sent to TikTok users last month, the company said that photo posts on TikTok would automatically be uploaded to Notes when the new social media app launched. </p><p>TikTok Notes ditches the rigid Instagram homepage format for one that matches the regular TikTok app. There are For You and Following pages, with each page containing two vertical columns featuring staggered posts. Comments, likes, and favorites appear the same on Notes as TikTok, too. There&apos;s no sign of TikTok Shop yet, which is interesting, considering that TikTok has pushed its digital marketplace hard in recent months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1616px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.83%;"><img id="APJPSRSd3vxEcwsFgkWRg5" name="TikTok-Notes-1.jpg" alt="TikTok Notes screenshot mockups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APJPSRSd3vxEcwsFgkWRg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1616" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TikTok)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The concept is obviously similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a>, but there are some things that set TikTok Notes apart. For starters, the Notes app includes headlines in the description to offset text. Again, this is similar to the regular TikTok app. The TikTok theming of black and lime green UI colors makes an appearance in Notes as well. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">/2 We hope that the TikTok community will use TikTok Notes to continue sharing their moments through photo posts.

<p>"We&apos;re in the early stages of experimenting with a dedicated space for photo and text content with TikTok Notes," TikTok said in a post on X. "Whether documenting adventures, expressing creativity, or simply sharing snapshots of one&apos;s day, the TikTok Notes experience is designed for those who would like to share and engage through photo content."</p><p>For now, this means that TikTok Notes isn&apos;t available in the U.S. yet. If you try to click on the Google Play Store or App Store links above, they will open in a browser but won&apos;t open in the actual mobile app stores. Anyone outside of Australia and Canada will most likely be greeted with a message saying, "This app is not available in your country or region." </p><p>We don&apos;t know when TikTok Notes will release globally, but there is reason to hope that it may be coming soon. TikTok Notes was only officially announced 10 days ago, and we already have a region-limited test. </p>

<p>Earth Day is just one day out of 365 each year, but it&apos;s an excellent reminder to adopt permanent changes in our lives that benefit the planet. The tech world is anything but eco-friendly by nature, but many companies have been trying to offset the negative ecological impact of their operations and existence.</p><p>Sustainability in the tech industry has many faces, but it&apos;s important that we&apos;re not just sold marketing gibberish to convince us that a company is going green. There must be actual change and betterment, not just a bunch of PR fluff and mini-projects that do nothing for the environment or anyone else.</p><p>For instance, it doesn&apos;t help the world much if your phone brand of choice uses paper packaging and doesn&apos;t give chargers, but it&apos;s still sourcing finite sources and materials from non-environmentally friendly or unethical sources.</p>
<p>A great way to be a sustainable tech user is by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-refurbished-phones">buying refurbished phones</a> and recycling your used devices. You can also donate your older gadgets and accessories to others. If you absolutely must have a new phone though, try to prioritize buying from brands that make a difference. And while you&apos;re at it, learn <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon/how-to-shop-sustainably-amazon">how to shop sustainably</a> as well.</p><p>It&apos;s very hard to rank or list out all the most sustainable and eco-friendly and recycling your used devices. Fortunately, there are some companies that are very clear and open in the way they are adopting greener practices and decisions. To make things easier for our conscious readers, here are some of the most notable sustainable tech accessories brands that should be on your radar.</p>
<h2 id="fairphone-2">Fairphone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WSNrkRL3BMvriuYCvwYAn" name="Fairphone-4-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Fairphone 4 with its back panel removed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WSNrkRL3BMvriuYCvwYAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fairphone is the most sustainable smartphone brand in the world. Not only does the Dutch phone manufacturer use recycled and eco-friendly materials in the making of its devices, but it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/impact/fair-materials/"><u>sources ethically</u></a> and designs its phones to be both self-repairable and upgradeable.</p><p>This means that a Fairphone device, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-4-review"><u>Fairphone 4</u></a>, can easily be fixed if broken and bumped up to updated new specs without the need to ditch the entire device if it gets damaged. The prices are reasonable, too, and you get plenty of accessories with the brand&apos;s phones.</p><p>But most impressive is the fact that Fairphone supports its smartphones for a long time, like the Fairphone 2, which received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-2-final-update"><u>software support for roughly seven years</u></a>. This was during a time when phone manufacturers like Samsung and Google had only supported phones for <em>up to</em> five years. </p>
<h2 id="teracube-2">Teracube</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7HeDHowZ3GrurDCd6fjCQ" name="teracube-2e-rear-open-2.jpg" alt="Teracube 2e held in one hand with its rear open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7HeDHowZ3GrurDCd6fjCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Teracube takes a leaf out of Fairphone&apos;s book and uses recycled materials as well as discarded e-waste in the production of its devices. On top of that, Teracube promises a four-year guarantee for all of its products. This includes water damage, a cracked display, aging batteries, and more. Before Fairphone arrived in the US, Teracube was the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones"> <u>most sustainable and easily repairable phone</u></a> in the region and is still a good option for anyone looking for an affordable phone. </p>
<h2 id="ifixit-2">iFixit</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3023px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hjLTAjvubj6YzkwJSiY28n" name="Google-Pixel-6-repair-ifitix.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro repair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjLTAjvubj6YzkwJSiY28n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3023" height="1699" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: iFitix via Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Repairability is crucial to sustainability because it encourages users to fix their own devices when they break instead of discarding them and buying new products. Android Central&apos;s Jerry Hildenbrand points out how companies often ignore repairability when it&apos;s something they should highlight when talking about sustainability. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-right-to-repair-stance">right-to-repair</a> movement advocates for easier repairability as well as more easily accessible tools and instructions to achieve this.</p><p>iFixit provides a key service in this category, selling comprehensive toolkits and providing how-tos and guides to help the average consumer repair their own gadgets. Holding on to your current electronics as long as you can prevents more e-waste from ending up in landfills or being shipped off to third-world countries, where it eventually ends up polluting the earth anyway.</p><p>iFixit has even teamed up with Google to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-begins-selling-official-googles-pixel-8-series-parts-and-tools-for-at-home-repairs">provide official parts</a> for devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and more.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-2">Samsung</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="zyPHFrNwQTgp67msjRhxUi" name="s23-series-sustainability-169.JPG" alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 sustainability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zyPHFrNwQTgp67msjRhxUi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1472" height="827" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Believe it or not, Samsung has made strides when it comes to the company&apos;s sustainable efforts. It started out with the Korean tech giant reducing and offsetting its carbon footprint. Eventually, the company got more creative and we saw less plastic and more paper packaging, shipping boxes that come with instructions to convert them into things like cat trees, and the disappearance of the power brick inside phone boxes.</p><p>With the launch of the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> series, Samsung unveiled its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsungs-galaxy-for-the-planet-initiative">&apos;Galaxy for the Planet&apos;</a> initiative. The S23 lineup was Samsung&apos;s most sustainable lineup to date at the time, built with 22% recycled glass for the screen, 100% recycled paper packaging, 80% recycled PET, and 20% recycled plastic. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/galaxy-s24-samsungs-first-flagship-phones-with-recycled-cobalt-are-here/">S24 family is even more eco-friendly</a> than its predecessor, using materials such as recycled cobalt.</p><p>On top of all that, you still have Samsung&apos;s commitment to minimize its carbon footprint across the board, from manufacturing and production to distribution and sales. At Galaxy Unpacked 2023, Samsung went as far as pledging to achieve net zero carbon emissions in all consumer product operations by the end of 2030.</p>
<h2 id="casetify-2">CASETiFY</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JXSu95WzksYSQKRvCRWoUb" name="casetify-google-pixel-6-4.jpg" alt="CASETiFY Google Pixel 6 cases on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXSu95WzksYSQKRvCRWoUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4133" height="2325" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you go down the eco-friendly line, you&apos;ll discover that there are plenty of sustainable tech brands in the accessories sector as well. CASETiFY is an exemplary example. Not only does the famous case maker reuse its own used cases and accessories to create new ones, but it also enables its own users to voluntarily send in their used products for free. This is part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casetify.com/sustainability">Re/CASETiFY</a> program, under which the brand aims to eliminate the need to source any new plastic by 2030.</p><p>CASETiFY also employs eco-friendly and sustainable tactics in its operations and donates $1 out of every sale made on Earth Day to plant a tree. To date, CASETiFY has planted over 463,406 trees and prevented more than 84,000 kilos of plastic from being dumped in the ocean or landfills. If you own a case or accessory from the brand, note the inscription on the side that indicates the percentage of recycled materials used to make the product. For phone cases, it&apos;s usually around 65%, which is an impressive number.</p>
<h2 id="pela-2">Pela</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WZvNxwBke7iD9qdG9ekQ6Q" name="Pela-cases-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Pela case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WZvNxwBke7iD9qdG9ekQ6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4299" height="2418" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pela-cases-hands-on-a-love-letter-to-mother-nature">Pela</a> might not be as popular as some of the other names on this list, but don&apos;t let that hold you back. The brand makes completely biodegradable and compostable phone cases for popular brands like Apple, Samsung, and Google. Every single product made by Pela can be buried in your backyard and become one with the soil eventually, including the grips and wallet add-ons. Oh and if you don&apos;t know how to repurpose or compost your phone case, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/how-to-reuse-repurpose-or-recycle-your-old-phone-cases">handy guide</a> for that.</p>
<h2 id="going-green-isn-apos-t-as-hard-as-it-used-to-be-when-it-comes-to-tech-2">Going green isn&apos;t as hard as it used to be when it comes to tech</h2>
<p>Whether you want a sustainable and repairable phone fit for a purist or a more traditional device that&apos;s good for the flowers, it&apos;s a lot easier to find good picks nowadays.</p><p>Fairphone and Teracube are fantastic brands that embrace the green initiative through and through. But it&apos;s even nicer to see big brands like Samsung start to take things seriously. Hopefully, future <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> and other electronics will have an even higher percentage of recycled materials.</p><p>Apart from CASETiFY and Pela, there are plenty more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-environmentally-friendly-phone-accessories">environmentally-friendly phone accessories</a> to consider. These two are the most reputable of the bunch and I have tested their products, which is why I highly recommend them.</p>

<ul><li>Razer has announced the Kishi Ultra and an updated version of the Kishi V2.</li><li>The Kishi Ultra features a USB-C port and can be expanded to fit devices up to the size of the iPad Mini.</li><li>This new controller offers "Pro Grade Ergonomics" along with "Sensa HD Haptics" and can even be used to play games on your PC.</li><li>Pricing starts at $149 for the Ultra and $99 for the updated Kishi V2, with both controllers available now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that we know for sure, it&apos;s that people love to play games on their phones or tablets. There are already a plethora of great controllers out there, but the Razer Kishi Ultra might just top them all.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi-ultra">new controller</a> hopes to turn you into a pro with its ergonomic design and a long list of standout features. Getting the mundane stuff out of the way first, the Ultra connects to any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> via the USB-C port on the right side. It&apos;s also equipped with pass-through charging and a 3.5mm headphone jack if you prefer the latency of wired earbuds over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>There are a couple of ways that Razer hopes that the Ultra will stand out in an increasingly crowded market. The first of which is the expanded device support, as the Ultra can now be expanded to connect with the 8.3-inch iPad Mini. This is great news for fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, as you don&apos;t have to worry about the Ultra not working with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>.</p>

<p>With the USB-C connection, you have much more added versatility than you might have thought. Not only will it work with the latest Android phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> lineup, and the iPad Mini, but the Razer Ultra can also be used as your primary controller from your PC, accomplished by just plugging the USB-C cable into your computer.</p><p>That&apos;s not even the best part about the Ultra. Razer is bringing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/razer/razer-announces-iskur-v2-gaming-chair-and-an-exciting-world-first-haptic-gaming-cushion-yes-you-read-that-right">Sensa HD Haptics</a> to its top-of-the-line controller, something that is not often seen in this space. At launch, there are a few games and apps that can take advantage of the Ultra&apos;s native haptics. These include many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">best emulators for Android</a> but also include Xbox Cloud Gaming, Fortnite, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cTXzT9cMNt882WpeB5dR59" name="razer-kishi-ultra-lifestyle-render-5.jpg" alt="Razer Kishi Ultra lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cTXzT9cMNt882WpeB5dR59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Razer)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more games are capable of taking advantage of the Kishi Ultra&apos;s "audio-based haptics," and Razer is hoping to see the list grow as developers jump on board. Paired with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.razer.bianca">Razer Nexus</a> app, you&apos;re able to adjust the sensitivity of audio haptics and enable "voice rejection," so a character interaction doesn&apos;t accidentally trigger the haptics.</p><p>Speaking of the Razer Nexus app, this aims to be your one-stop shop for everything when it comes to gaming on your phone. This includes acting as a game launcher, calibrating thumb stick dead zones, remapping buttons, and more. As the Kishi Ultra also comes with RGB, you&apos;ll use the Nexus app to change the colors and Chroma lighting effects.</p><p>With a controller as feature-rich as the Kishi Ultra, you&apos;ll need to get your wallet ready. The Kishi Ultra retails for $149 and is available worldwide starting today.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy A35 5G is now available for purchase in the US through various channels, including Samsung's website, retail stores, and major carriers and retailers.</li><li>It comes in two color options: Awesome Navy and Awesome Lilac with a starting price just shy of $400.</li><li>Samsung incentivizes purchases of the Galaxy A35 5G with limited-time offers, including a 30% discount on the Galaxy Buds FE and up to $150 in credit through trade-ins.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has added another option to its affordable 5G lineup in the US. The Galaxy A35 5G <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a15-galaxy-a25-launch">joins the A15 and A25</a>, giving you more choices for a phone with next-gen speeds without breaking the bank.</p><p>The Galaxy A35 5G is available to purchase via Samsung&apos;s website, retail stores, and major carriers and retailers. It comes in two colors, Awesome Navy and Awesome Lilac, and starts at just under $400. However, the Galaxy A55, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">debuted with the A35 earlier this year</a>, won&apos;t be hitting the US market.</p><p>The phone sports a 6.6-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. And for selfies, there&apos;s a 13MP front camera tucked into a punch hole at the top center.</p><p>Flip it over, and you&apos;ll spot the triple camera setup consisting of a 50MP main camera with image stabilization to keep your photos sharp. Plus, there&apos;s an 8MP ultra-wide camera for fitting more in the shot and a 5MP macro lens.</p><p>The A35 5G runs on Samsung&apos;s own Exynos 1380 processor, which should give you plenty of power for everyday tasks. It comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can pop in a microSD card for even more space if you need it. The 5,000mAh battery should last you all day, and it supports up to 25W fast wired charging.</p><p>The A35 5G can take a beating with its IP67 dust and water resistance rating. It also comes with Android 14 out of the box, and Samsung promises to keep it updated with four major Android versions and security updates for five years.</p>
