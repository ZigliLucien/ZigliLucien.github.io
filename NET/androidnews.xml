                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 has reportedly appeared in two databases as Google proceeded with its charging case certification.</li><li>The listings show the case may feature a 650mAh battery capacity, which would be a 30mAh increase from 2022.</li><li>Little else is known about the buds, but there are specs from its original iteration to look back on.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information about Google&apos;s upcoming Pixel Buds Pro model has appeared following its certification appearance overseas.</p><p>The assumed charging case for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was spotted on UL Demko (Denmark) and Safety Korea, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-battery-leaked/">91Mobiles</a>. Regarding the former, the case&apos;s listing shows model number GH8TQ, with the database stating it features a rechargeable Li-ion battery.</p><p>What&apos;s important here is that the charging case has been given a battery capacity of 650mAh.</p><p>A photo of the Pixel Buds Pro 2&apos;s battery for its charging case appeared on Safety Korea&apos;s listing. However, further images of the device (such as its case) weren&apos;t spotted in the database as Google continued the certification process.</p><p>More information regarding the Buds wasn&apos;t detailed in the assumed Pro 2 listing, either. The publication speculates that the upcoming device could launch sometime after I/O 2024 in May, which would (ideally) feature its official launch. Rumors add that the device could be delayed and withheld until Google&apos;s fall launch of the Pixel 9 series.</p>

<p>While rumors of the new device are limited, we have the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a> from 2022 to look back on. The original device featured a charging case with a 620mAh battery, which means the rumors could spell a 30mAh boost if true. As the publication notes, the Buds Pro could deliver 31 extra hours of battery. The increase might see that number increased slightly, but we&apos;ll have to wait to be sure.</p><p>Moreover, the original Buds Pro could last for around 11 hours with ANC disabled and seven with it on. If Google is looking to boost its case&apos;s battery, then perhaps there&apos;s more in store for the buds, too.</p><p>Also, with Google&apos;s newfound endeavors with AI, perhaps we&apos;re looking at a chance for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to impact the Buds Pro 2.</p><p>It remains to be seen what Google is preparing to bring for I/O 2024. It was rumored that the company&apos;s fall event could be packed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-successor-name-change-rumors">upcoming Fold successor</a> could shift toward that later section of the year. If Google does delay its Buds Pro 2 launch until the fall, then we might see even more excitement.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro launched in July 2022 and came with notable advancements over the base Buds model. The Pro variant features rich, clear sound with decent performance from its ANC (active noise cancelation). The Buds Pro contain stable and responsive touch controls so users can control their music and take calls with ease.</p></p>

<ul><li>Digging through Android's code seemingly unearthed Google's work at implementing a new satellite SOS UI.</li><li>The UI will guide users through a setup process as they must align their phones with a satellite to begin communicating with emergency services.</li><li>Google is preparing to bring satellite connectivity capabilities with Android 15 and with its upcoming Tensor G4 chip for the Pixel 9.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some digging into Google&apos;s code seems to have unearthed an alleged first look at how users will get its Android satellite connectivity to work.</p><p>According to Google News <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/google_nws/4004">on Telegram</a>, users will have to keep their phones in line with satellites floating in low orbit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/pixel_9s_satellite_sos_interface_is_in_the_works_heres_what_it_looks_like_now-news-62447.php">GSMArena</a>). During setup, the code shows that users will be prompted to "get a clear view of the sky" by avoiding obstructions like buildings, trees, and mountains.Â </p><p>Once done, users will be given a UI page with a large circle in its center. Its purpose is to aid users in locating a satellite in their vicinity. A stronger connection will be obtained by ensuring you&apos;re facing the satellite straight on, meaning it&apos;s in the center of the radius.</p><p>The post adds that users can minimize this SOS page when connected to continue texting emergency services or family members. Android will turn the page into a floating display on a device&apos;s homepage, similar to a widget. If minimized, users will continue to ensure the satellite is properly aligned with their phone.</p><p>Google News states the new SOS UI was spotted in Android&apos;s Adaptive Connectivity Services app. Currently, it&apos;s not a page users can access, as it&apos;s still in the works.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve known for a while that Google is preparing to bring satellite connectivity via Android 15, and the software&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-second-developer-preview">second developer preview</a> shared more. The preview highlighted the company&apos;s continued work at implementing such connectivity for the next major OS launch later this year. Apps in Android 15 will have the ability to state whether or not a user is connected to a satellite.</p><p>Additionally, Google is adding support for SMS/MMS and RCS chats when connected to a satellite.</p><p>More importantly, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">was spotted yesterday</a> (Apr. 15) that Google&apos;s upcoming Tensor G4 chip for the Pixel 9 will utilize a new Samsung modem. The modem was stated to support 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN) for satellite connectivity capabilities with the new flagship series.</p><p>Android 15 recently achieved its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta milestone</a>, meaning we&apos;re right on schedule regarding Google&apos;s timeframe for its launch, likely this fall.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp introduces chat filters to allow users to quickly view unread messages or group chats without scrolling through numerous conversations.</li><li>These filters will appear at the top of the chat list, offering options like All, Unread, and Groups.</li><li>The filters will be gradually rolled out to users, with availability expected within the next few weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-beta-tests-chat-filtersagain">new chat filters</a> meant to help you see just unread messages or all your groups in a snap, removing the need to scroll through tons of chats to find them.</p><p>The new filters will pop up right at the top of your chat list, with options like <em>All</em>, <em>Unread</em>, and <em>Groups</em>. When you open the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging app</a>, you&apos;ll start with the "All" filter, which gives you a view of all your messages. Switch to "Unread" to see only those messages you haven&apos;t checked out yet or marked as unread.</p><p>These filters are even easier to use than the hidden search bar filter for unread messages. If you&apos;re unaware, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> lets you peek at unread messages through a filter in the search bar. But these new filters make it even easier to find that option when you need it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "Groups" filter has been a hot request, as per WhatsApp. This feature gathers up all your group chats in one spot, so you can sift through your group messages without any hassle.

<p>"We believe filters will make it easier for people to stay organized and find their most important conversations and help navigate through messages more efficiently," WhatsApp said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/find-messages-faster-with-chat-filters" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "Weâll continue to build more options to help you focus on what matters most."</p><p>The filters are hitting your chats starting today, and everyone will get them over the next few weeks.</p><p>WhatsApp&apos;s been on a roll with new features. In addition to the filters coming to your chat list, the service added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-adds-search-by-date-feature-for-android">another search feature last month for Android users</a>: searching by date. Now, you can finally pinpoint messages effortlessly based on when they were sent instead of endlessly scrolling for that one message.</p><p>And here&apos;s a fun fact: this feature is already up and running on iOS, Mac desktop, and WhatsApp Web.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus might be gearing up to release a new foldable phone that could rival the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, boasting a zoom lens and macro camera.</li><li>A leaker says camera upgrades expected in OPPO's upcoming foldable may carry over to OnePlus, hinting at a similar model with a telephoto camera.</li><li>While flip phones excel in portability, their camera capabilities are usually lacking, but the rumored inclusion of a telephoto lens in the OnePlus Flip could change the game.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus already has a book-style foldable phone, but a new rumor says its next one might be a Galaxy Z Flip contender, and this one could even have a zoom lens, which is rare for foldable phones.</p><p>A leaker who goes by the handle Smart Pikachu on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/O9GOwe7lS" target="_blank">Weibo</a> says that OnePlus might drop a second foldable phone this year. But it will supposedly be different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and will instead flip open like Motorola&apos;s Razr models and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip line. The tipster adds that it will pack a telephoto and macro rear camera (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-flip-foldable-leak-3434110/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Foldables are seriously turning heads in the smartphone world these days, even though there aren&apos;t heaps to pick from just yet. It&apos;s no wonder every phone maker wants a piece of the action.</p><p>Flip phones fold in half for ultimate portability, unlike those giant slabs everyone else uses. Plus, they are usually more affordable than book-style foldables, putting them right up there with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> in terms of price.</p><p>But their cameras often leave something to be desired. Usually, they&apos;re rocking a dual-camera setup, but the telephoto lens is often the one that&apos;s missing. However, if this rumor about the OnePlus Flip is true, it could be a game-changer for flip phones by bringing a telephoto lens to the game.</p><p>The tipster is hinting that these camera upgrades will debut on OPPO&apos;s upcoming compact foldable, and it&apos;s likely they&apos;ll trickle down to a similar OnePlus model, maybe with a slight tweak or rebranding.</p><p>Even though it&apos;s not official yet, it&apos;s not exactly a wild guess. The OnePlus Open was basically a twin of the OPPO Find N3. If OnePlus rolls out a flip phone resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a>, it wouldn&apos;t be a shocker.</p><p>Plus, having a flip phone with a telephoto camera would be pretty unique since hardly any flip foldables offer this feature right now. In fact, the only one you can actually buy right now with a telephoto camera is the Find N3 Flip. So, if this rumor is accurate, the OnePlus Flip could be a real standout.</p>

The term "Google Pay" still exists for making contactless NFC payments in stores, but you use the Google Wallet app for those transactions.</p><p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay app is shutting down</a> later this year, you&apos;re probably curious which Pay features will transfer over to Wallet. You may also have heard that Google Wallet supports features like driver&apos;s licenses, tickets, and medical info, and you may want to know how to access these.</p><p>Our in-depth Google Wallet guide will break down its history, list of key features, recent news and updates, and everything else you need to know!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-summarized"><span>Google Wallet, summarized</span></h2>
<p>The original Google Wallet launched in 2011 as a Nexus phone exclusive for contactless credit card payments at specific locations. A lack of NFC-enabled phones, insufficient retail partnerships, and little consumer interest sunk the initiative.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-rolling-out-starting-today">Android Pay</a> took Wallet&apos;s place in 2015 as a payment system with much more business support and infrastructure, while Wallet scaled down into a peer-to-peer payment system.Â </p><p>By 2018, both services had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-and-google-wallet-join-together-form-google-pay">consolidated</a> into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> brand, a single app for both tap-to-pay and sending money to friends, and Google Wallet ceased to be. Over time, Google Pay added boarding passes, event confirmations, transit balances, and other tools that weren&apos;t strictly "payments."</p><p>Google&apos;s love of renaming services for a marketing boost came full circle in July 2022, when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-launch">rebranded its payment service to Google Wallet</a> once again. Google Pay persisted as a peer-to-peer payment app with its wallet-like features removed, but it will shut down on June 4, 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN" name="Google-Wallet-screenshot-3.jpeg" alt="Google Wallet example animation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet will continue to support "Google Pay" payments in stores worldwide. It <strong>won&apos;t</strong> enable P2P payments like the original Pay app, however, and your current Google Pay balance will only be transferrable through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/home" target="_blank">website</a> once the Pay mobile app shuts down.</p><p>Google Wallet supports a variety of banks and credit cards across over 80 countries. It also supports a variety of other passes, IDs, and stored information that we&apos;ll break down in the next section.</p><p>Generally speaking, Google Wallet pulls information from other Google apps on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. So, for example, if you receive an email on Gmail with a delayed flight time, it&apos;ll notify you and change the stored boarding pass information.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-can-you-store-in-google-wallet"><span>What can you store in Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2171px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg" name="Google-Wallet-app-examples.jpg" alt="Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2171" height="1221" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First and foremost, you can deposit <strong>credit</strong> and <strong>debit cards</strong> in Google Wallet. Most banks and cards are compatible, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">has added</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">dozens of new banks</a> in 2024 to fill out the list before Google Pay&apos;s shutdown. You can ensure your bank is included by checking the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/7454247?hl=en&ref_topic=7625138" target="_blank">supported contactless payments</a> sorted by country.</p><p>As a sidenote, we have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lock-down-google-wallet-cards">how to lock down your Google Wallet cards</a> if your phone is stolen, so that the thief can&apos;t use tap-to-pay with those stored cards.</p><p>You can add your <strong>loyalty </strong>or <strong>membership cards</strong>, then tap your phone or watch to apply discounts or balances, or even pay directly for items. Check if your loyalty card is eligible by tapping <strong>Add to Wallet > Loyalty card </strong>and entering the program name.</p><p>Plus, you can keep your <strong>boarding passes</strong> and <strong>event tickets</strong> in Google Wallet, so entering a plane or stadium is as simple as pulling them up and tapping your phone. In March 2024, Google updated Wallet so that Gmail confirmation emails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">automatically export passes to Wallet</a>, saving you the trouble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC" name="Google-Wallet-Add-Transit-Card.jpeg" alt="Adding public transit card to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet also hosts <strong>transit cards</strong> and <strong>parking passes</strong>, though once again, there is no guarantee that your local public transit or parking system will support Google Wallet without checking. Currently, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Toronto are the only cities to support Google Wallet transit passes or payments.</p><p>You may add <strong>COVID-19 vaccine passports</strong> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-covid-vaccine-cards-google-wallet">other medical info</a> to Google Wallet as well.</p><p>Other Google Wallet functions include <strong>digital car keys</strong>, <strong>corporate office passes</strong>, and <strong>hotel keys</strong>. Digital car keys require a relatively recent phone running Android 12 or later, and not all cars will support them. As for corporate badges, only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/14085932?hl=en&ref_topic=11925097&sjid=11940236237620777137-NA" target="_blank">10 countries</a> support corporate passes today, and your employer must buy into the program.</p><p>Google&apos;s biggest challenge, however, will be to enable <strong>digital driver&apos;s licenses</strong> or <strong>student IDs</strong>. Certain American states have begun to support digital IDs, but it&apos;s extremely limited at the moment.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-i-store-my-driver-s-license-in-google-wallet"><span>Can I store my driver's license in Google Wallet?</span></h2>

<p>During Google I/O 2022, VP of Product Management Sameer Samat announced on stage that "we&apos;re working with states here in the U.S. and governments around the world to bring digital IDs to wallet later this year, starting with driver&apos;s licenses."</p><p>That statement turned out to be a bit optimistic: The ID program did launch in Maryland by the end of 2022, but Google took until October 2023 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-ids-for-three-more-us-states">add digital ID support for Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia residents</a>.</p><p>Dong Min Kim, Google&apos;s director of product management for Google Wallet, did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">promise in January</a> that "Digital ID will be a cornerstone for us in the next year" and that more states&apos; IDs will come to Wallet in the coming months. But we&apos;ve yet to hear anything since, and there are regulatory hurdles to making this happen.</p><p>To add a driver&apos;s license to Google Wallet, you&apos;ll need an Android phone (version 8 or higher) with Bluetooth and Nearby Devices active and a screen lock protecting it.</p><p>With all of those prerequisites fulfilled, you can simply open the Wallet app and tap <strong>Add to Wallet > ID card</strong>. You&apos;ll then have to take photos of the front and back of your ID, then record a short video of yourself to submit for verification. At that point, you should be able to use your ID in lieu of a physical card at participating airports.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-student-id-google-wallet">adding a student ID to Google Wallet</a>, we have a guide for that as well, but it will once again depend on whether or not your school supports the feature.</p>

Once you&apos;ve selected a bank in Google Wallet, you&apos;ll most likely need to log into the bank&apos;s website, or enter a PIN or authorization code.</p><p>You can also choose to make Paypal a payment method in Google Wallet, though only in the United States and Germany.</p>

<p>Android users, specifically Samsung phone owners, have two main choices for their payment app: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Google Wallet or Samsung Wallet</a>. The latter launched around the same time as Google Wallet, combining Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass into one service. Sound familiar?</p><p>Like Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet collects your digital payment cards, boarding passes, vaccination cards, and digital car keys, with the eventual goal of adding IDs and licenses.</p><p><em>Unlike</em> Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet stores passwords, a remnant of the feature on Samsung Pass. Plus, anyone invested in crypto can "monitor their digital asset portfolio by checking the value of their cryptocurrencies across various exchanges" within Wallet.</p><p>Samsung Wallet is available now, but only on Samsung phones via the Galaxy Store â whereas Google Wallet is available on all Android phones via the Play Store â and only 21 countries, well short of Google&apos;s list.</p><p>Looking beyond the Android phone ecosystem, we also have a general guide on how the five main payment systems â <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-pay-vs-amazon-pay-vs-google-pay-vs-samsung-pay">Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Meta Pay, and Amazon Pay</a> â compare to one another.Â </p><p>To briefly summarize, Google and Apple have the most robust features and widespread presence for both mobile and web payments. Amazon Pay is more limited but takes very little setup if you have a Prime account, while Meta Pay is most useful for frequent Facebook Marketplace users.</p>

<p>The biggest recent change to Google Wallet was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-qr-barcode-pass-rollout">photo function</a>, which lets you take a photo of a physical pass and have that data auto-transcribed into Wallet, rather than making you type it out yourself.</p><p>Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-apple-pass-more-user-support">added support for Apple Wallet files</a> in early 2024, though the rollout is still ongoing. People have noticed glitches, since ".pkpass" file expect you to be using an iPhone, but those glitches should be fixed over time.</p><p>Another controversy arose when Google Wallet began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">requiring you to verify your identity</a> before making contactless payments in certain countries. While some countries already required this, others let you make payments indefinitely so long as they weren&apos;t above a certain threshold.</p><p>Google later created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-verification-settings-to-balance-security-and-convenience">"Verification Settings"</a> for Wallet, letting you decide in advance whether to require authentication before certain actions, such as using Wallet as a transit pass.</p><p>In late 2023, there was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-vulnerability-exposes-card-information">Google Wallet vulnerability</a> that exposed credit card information via a standard NFC reader.

Sometimes, internet connection can be spotty or fail altogether, and saving them for offline viewing will give you a library of content to pass the time.</p><p>Whether you&apos;re watching videos on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> or not, downloading YouTube videos is quick and easy. Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/streaming-platforms-prioritize-content-over-ui">streaming services aren&apos;t getting better</a>, they still want you to pay for more content. But finding something to watch when your internet isn&apos;t working can be frustrating, so it&apos;s always a good idea to have a backup plan and videosÂ toÂ watch.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To download YouTube videos, you must have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> subscription.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-youtube-videos-to-watch-offline-2">How to download YouTube videos to watch offline</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube app </strong>on your device.</p><p>2. Find and <strong>open the video</strong> you want to download.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Download </strong>in the menu that appears below the video.</p><p>4. If you don&apos;t have YouTube Premium, you&apos;ll see a <strong>prompt to get it</strong>, which is required to download videos. You can start the free trial or select<strong> Not now </strong>if you don&apos;t wish to proceed. If you give the Premium version a chance, you&apos;ll see a Subscribe button with information letting you know the day the free trial ends and how much you&apos;ll be charged after. YouTube will remind you that your free trial is ending seven days before the deadline.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8" name="download youtube videos 1-3.jpg" alt="youtube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. If you have YouTube Premium, youâll be given <strong>options for the resolution to download the video</strong>. Naturally, the higher the resolution, the more space the download will take up on your device and the potentially longer the video will take to download (though with good Wi-Fi or a solid cellular connection, this likely wonât be an issue). Choose the desired resolution and select <strong>Download</strong>.</p><p>6. Once selected, the <strong>video will automatically begin downloading,</strong> and youâll see the download process as the arrow lights up.</p><p>7. Once downloaded, the download button will show <strong>Downloaded</strong> with a white checkmark beside it.</p>

<p>As noted, to download YouTube videos for offline viewing, like the top trending videos to watch during your commutes or a walk down memory lane with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">YouTube Music 2023</a>, you need a YouTube Premium subscription, which is $13.99 a month. However, you can try it out for one month for free before committing.</p><p>Once downloaded, you have up to 29 days to watch the downloaded video. If you havenât gotten around to watching yet after the timeframe expires, you can reconnect to a mobile or Wi-Fi network and download the video again (if itâs still available for offline viewing). If it is no longer available, it will automatically be removed from your device the next time you sync it.Â If any changes have been made to the video, they will be applied when you&apos;re online.</p><p>Once a YouTube video is downloaded, it resides locally on your device. That means itâs taking up valuable space, so itâs a good idea to delete it once you are done watching and no longer need it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-delete-downloaded-youtube-videos-2">How to delete downloaded YouTube videos</h2>
<p>Deleting the video is simple:</p><p>1. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Swipe up and choose <strong>Downloads</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>dots to the side</strong> of the video.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Delete</strong> from downloads at the bottom.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-smart-downloads-on-youtube-2">What are Smart Downloads on YouTube?</h2>
<p>Smart Downloads are recommended videos that YouTube automatically downloads so you always have something to watch. The downloads will stop when you&apos;re low on storage or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/wifi-keeps-disconnecting-and-reconnecting.1064087/">disconnected from Wi-Fi</a>. Based on your viewing habits, YouTube will automatically download videos you might like.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-youtube-smart-downloads-work-2">How does YouTube Smart Downloads work?</h2>
<p>If the videos are not downloading, you can enable the feature by:</p><p>1. Tapping your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>cogwheel</strong> at the top right.</p><p>3. Go to <strong>Backgrounds & downloads</strong>.</p><p>4. Look for and <strong>toggle on</strong> the <strong>Smart downloads</strong> option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU" name="Turn-off-smart-download-YouTube.jpg" alt="Steps to turn on or off Smart Downloads on YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As long as you&apos;re here, you can also make other adjustments, such as only downloading over Wi-Fi, adjusting how Playback works, and adjusting how much storage Smart downloads takes up and the quality of Smart downloads. You&apos;ll also see options for Delete all downloads and how much storage you have left. When you adjust the storage space the feature takes up by using the slider; you&apos;ll also see how much video time that is. For example, you set the storage limit to 1.5GB, and besides it, you&apos;ll see that that equals 11 hours of videos.</p>
<h2 id="keep-downloading-2">Keep downloading</h2>
<p>It&apos;s easy to take the Internet for granted and think it&apos;ll always be there, but it&apos;s best to be prepared and have some YouTube videos to watch. If you&apos;re going to watch YouTube on your computer, get ready for a change since YouTube is testing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-might-change-the-location-of-video-titles-and-comments">redesigned video player on the web</a>.</p><p>Since YouTube Music is also part of the package, remember that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-for-android-and-ios-gain-activity-feed">rolling out a new Activity feed for Android and iOS</a>.

If you&apos;re just looking for a basic smartphone with some surprising flagship-level features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-7a-5g-128gb-unlocked-charcoal/6539915.p"><strong>Best Buy is shaving up to $250 OFF the Google Pixel 7a</strong></a>, a midrange device that features 128GB of storage for the base model, the efficiency of the Tensor G2 chipset, and excellent cameras with 4K video recording. The $250 discount is applied when you activate the phone through a carrier on Best Buy&apos;s site, but you can also score a $150 discount when you buy unlocked. That&apos;s the biggest straight discount that the phone has ever received.Â </p><p>Along with its good-looking 6.1-inch AMOLED display and its great cameras, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> comes with five years of Pixel updates, and it includes many of the same useful features as last year&apos;s more-expensive Pixel 7 Pro.Â </p>

<p>If you're not looking for the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> out there and you'd rather prioritize a low sticker price, this may be the perfect deal for you. For a limited time, you can get a straight $150 off the unlocked Google Pixel 7a at Best Buy, representing 30% off the normal price. Alternatively, you can activate the phone through a carrier and get $250 off, which amounts to a 50% discount!Â </p>
<p>This simple smartphone includes a bright 6.1-inch AMOLED display, a slick chipset, and capable cameras for both photos and video. Plus, get five years of Android OS updates at an even cheaper price than this phone normal comes with.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB">Amazon - $349.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-7a-5g-128gb-unlocked-charcoal/6539915.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="223eeb51-3ace-435e-894e-b1706c310fa1" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499" data-dimension48="$499">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>âRecommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a phone with an especially bright, vibrant display of around 6.1 inches; you want an affordable smartphone that still has a good camera for photo and video; you prioritize a phone with several years of OS updates.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re looking for a smartphone with great battery life; you plan to use your phone for gaming and don&apos;t mind paying extra for top-notch performance; you don&apos;t like a phone with a plastic exterior.</p><p>With the release of the Pixel 8a likely just around the corner, the Pixel 7a is no longer groundbreaking, but it has all the basic features that Pixel fans are looking for, and this deal makes the already affordable phone even cheaper. With a 6.1-inch AMOLED display and powerful cameras with 4K video recording, it&apos;s not hard to appreciate this phone&apos;s offeringsâespecially at this extra low price.</p><p>Some of the downsides of this phone include its basic plastic structural design, the lack of a telephoto lens, and some pretty subpar battery life. Still, it remains a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, and for those looking for a deal on something reliable, this is honestly a pretty great pick at this price â <em>especially </em>if you decide to activate today.</p>

It's always best to have more storage space than you think you might need just in case your needs change and you're not stuck with a tablet you can't even update due to lack of storage space.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="which-fire-tablet-storage-size-should-you-buy-2">Which Fire Tablet storage size should you buy?</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to know about buying an Amazon Fire tablet (or any modern mobile gadget, for that matter!) is that the listed (or advertised) storage capacity is different from the usable storage space you&apos;ll end up with. Amazon&apos;s tablets use a Fire OS layered on top of the Android operating system, which requires a decent chunk of storage for core system functions and all of Amazon&apos;s apps and services that come preinstalled on these devices.</p><p>Now, you can look at your options, especially when considering a tablet that offers 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage sizes. That low-end 16GB tablet will only give you about 12GB of usable storage. Depending on your plans for downloading games, movies, and other media, you&apos;ll want as much storage as possible.</p>
<p>The Fire HD 10 tablet comes in 32GB and 64GB variants, so spending a little extra to double the storage size is a no-brainer. It&apos;s also worth pointing out that Amazon recently updated its line of kid-friendly Amazon Fire devices. While the previous 16GB Fire 7 Kids Edition may have offered enough storage for your tiny tech wizard, Amazon now offers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-hd-10-kids-vs-kids-pro" target="_blank">Fire HD 10 Kids and Fire HD 10 Kids Pro</a> tablets, both of which double the storage space to 32GB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ok7osy6uGAKYpCWdVURe3G" name="amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-on-table.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 8 (2022) laying face down on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ok7osy6uGAKYpCWdVURe3G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things get trickier (and pricier) when you consider the newer Fire HD tablets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review" target="_blank">Fire HD 8</a> model, which is still our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet" target="_blank">best Amazon Fire Tablet</a> on the market right now, is available in 32GB and 64GB options, as are the Fire HD 8 Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Fire HD 10</a>, and Fire HD 10 Plus. The 32GB size is quite a reasonable choice here, and depending on how you plan to use the tablet and the prevalence of media streaming services these days, you might not even need to opt for the 64GB variant.</p>
<p>Then there&apos;s the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review" target="_blank">Fire Max 11</a>, which comes in 64GB and 128GB storage sizes, the latter being the largest storage size ever offered in a Fire tablet. Apart from the usual things like media consumption, the Fire Max 11 is also intended for productivity-centric workflows. Even then, the 64GB option will be more than sufficient for basic needs.</p>
<h2 id="expand-your-fire-tablet-apos-s-storage-with-a-microsd-card-2">Expand your Fire Tablet&apos;s storage with a microSD card</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4u4mvimzVmhokVAsQbZGFj" name="Amazon-Fire-HD-10-2021-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4u4mvimzVmhokVAsQbZGFj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to storage space, the price tends to increase with the capacity. However, if you opt for a device with less storage to save, don&apos;t worryâthanks to the versatile microSD slot, you always have the option to increase in size with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">decent memory card</a>. Thanks to the extra space, you can modify your device&apos;s storage to fit your needs.</p><p>A microSD slot is a reliable feature that you&apos;ve always seen on the Fire tablets and still do in the newer models. With this slot, you can expand the capacity as much as you need. The slot can be a real lifesaver when you unexpectedly need extra storage space.</p><p>When it comes to great deals on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-microsd-cards-amazon-fire-tablet">microSD cards for Fire Tablets</a>, we&apos;ve got you covered with these great options. You can choose from options as little as 64GB or as much as 1TB. If you&apos;re an average user and want to have enough space, you can always go with the 256GB version. They usually go for about $25, but you never know when one of them might be on sale.</p>

This means adopting a more eco-friendly attitude in all aspects of our lives, be it as consumers, manufacturers, or sellers. Amazon shoppers looking to go green will be pleased to know that there are many ways to make your shopping experience more sustainable. Here&apos;s what you can do to purchase products sustainably on Amazon.</p>

<p>Before plunging into the details, here are a couple of facts about Amazon that&apos;ll help you understand the company&apos;s outlook on sustainability. A few years ago, the e-commerce goliath joined other popular brands like Microsoft, Best Buy, and Verizon in signing the Climate Pledge. In line with the aims of the non-profit organization, Amazon aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2040. Billions of dollars worth of investments have already gone into this initiative, giving birth to projects like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-promoting-eco-friendly-shopping-its-new-climate-pledge-friendly-program">Climate Pledge Friendly program</a>, green operations and logistics decisions, and the use of renewable energy across many Amazon buildings and warehouses.</p><p>There&apos;s the Amazon Aware store that sells various household and lifestyle products that have been certified by third parties for their use of organic, recycled, and bio-based materials. For sellers, entities like Amazon Launchpad exist to help them implement sustainability across their brands.</p><p>If you own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-speaker">best Alexa-enabled speakers</a> and live in the U.S., Amazon has made it even more accessible to contribute to an eco-friendly cause. All you need to do is say <strong>"Alexa, grow a treeâ</strong> and you can donate a dollar towards the One Tree Planted initiative. All your contributions are used to plant trees, converting every $1 into one tree planted on your behalf, combatting climate change and pollution one tree at a time.</p><p>Clearly, Amazon is committed to offsetting the negative environmental impacts of its business operations. The tech giant has taken many steps towards achieving a more sustainable existence and enables you, the consumer, to also participate in the same cause. Now, let&apos;s look at the many options available to you to shop more sustainably on Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-climate-pledge-friendly"><span>Climate Pledge Friendly</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1437px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="etZLzcWyrm6VLAAHG5azuG" name="amazon-climate-friendly-pledge.jpg" alt="Amazon Climate Pledge Friendly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/etZLzcWyrm6VLAAHG5azuG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1437" height="809" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one of the first things to do when shopping in a more sustainable way on Amazon. All you have to do is look for the little green <strong>Climate Pledge Friendly</strong> badge under the product listing. No matter what you&apos;re buying, if it has been certified as environmentally friendly under The Climate Pledge requirements, Amazon will print that little green logo under the item&apos;s name.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>amazon.com/climatepledgefriendly</strong>.</p><p>2. Search for the product of your choice. You can also use the Climage Pledge Friendly filter on the left to narrow down the results.</p><p>3. Look for a listing with the <strong>green Climate Pledge Friendly badge </strong>or that lists a sustainability feature (or more than one). If you tap on <strong>sustainability feature,</strong> you&apos;ll see a pop-up on the right side that outlines what they are. It could be that the item was made with a certain percentage of recycled materials or that it is Certified Climate neutral by a third-party organization.</p>

<p>Going green can mean many things. Instead of purchasing new products, you can get used ones that have been refurbished so that the materials do not go to waste.

<p>If you&apos;re the sort of person who doesn&apos;t want to purchase used or refurbished products, there is another option. Shopping sustainably on Amazon doesn&apos;t always lead to preloved or renewed items. Under the <strong>Amazon Trade-in</strong> program, you can trade-in your own used electronics for Amazon gift cards and/or promotional discounts. The Amazon Trade-in procedure varies depending on what it is that you want to trade-in.</p><p>After you have selected your device under the Amazon Trade-in section on the Amazon website, you&apos;ll have to answer some questions about it to confirm its condition and value. The answers to your questions determine the value you will get and how fast you will get it. For instance, certain items qualify for instant payment, while others may not yield you any monetary gain until you&apos;ve sent them in for appraisal.</p><p>What&apos;s really great is that shipping your used electronic gadgets to Amazon doesn&apos;t cost you anything. Even if the item is worth nothing, Amazon will ship it back to you free of charge. All you have to do is print the shipping label and send it in. Here&apos;s how you can initiate the Amazon Trade-in process.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>amazon.com/tradein</strong>.</p><p>2. Select the device category that matches your item.</p><p>3. Read and <strong>follow the Amazon Trade-in instructions</strong> for your specific device.</p>
