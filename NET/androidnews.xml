<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a phone with a vibrant, bright display; speed and battery life in a smartphone are important to you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re hoping to use all the latest AI features; you want a phone with over four years of software support. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> is probably my favorite phone released in 2024 — and many of my colleagues agree — namely because it focuses on what&apos;s actually important in a smartphone. You get a glorious 120Hz display with 4500 nits of peak brightness alongside a super-fast Snapdragon chipset that can handle any task with ease. The battery life is also arguably better than the base model Galaxy S24, and the 100W wired charging ensures you&apos;ll be back in business quick when you do eventually need to juice up.</p><p>Sure, the cameras aren&apos;t groundbreaking and you&apos;ll miss a few of those trendy features prioritized by other OEMs lately (<em>have you heard of this new thing called AI?</em>) but the OnePlus 12 is an epic performer where it counts. And for many Android lovers, that&apos;s all that matters.</p>

<p><em>The OnePlus 12 is a great phone, but it&apos;s not invincible.

<p>Apple has been working on iOS 18 for months now, but all of the cool and potentially useful AI features won&apos;t be arriving until iOS 18.1. This is likely to launch <em>after</em> the iPhone 16, which we expect will come with iOS 18 out of the box. What this means is that many of the defining features of Apple&apos;s latest OS likely won&apos;t be available with the company&apos;s newest phones on day one. </p><p>It didn&apos;t take long for people to notice that the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> Developer Beta was missing a few things. Namely, anything to do with Apple Intelligence, which was rather disappointing when you consider just how much time was spent talking about the upcoming features. </p><p>Not long after iOS 18 was released to developers, Apple made a surprising decision: It introduced the iOS 18.1 Developer Beta. This is where the real fun was expected to appear, and that&apos;s exactly what has happened. </p><p>While there are still a few features that we&apos;re waiting to try out, iOS 18.1 Developer Beta 3 introduced Apple&apos;s response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>. Since Google has the best name for this feature, Apple had to come up with something else, deciding to settle with "Clean Up."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfD6Q5pxGMKDQxCieNMHP6" name="everything-ios-18-stole-from-android.png" alt="iOS 18 Lock Screen on iPhone 15 Pro Max and Android 15 logo on Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfD6Q5pxGMKDQxCieNMHP6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needless to say, Apple&apos;s a bit behind the times here, as Magic Eraser has been widely available for years and is even available for iPhones. Even Samsung has its own competitor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-object-eraser-samsung-phone">Object Eraser</a>, which attempts to match what Magic Eraser has to offer, but from within the native Samsung Gallery app. </p><p>Seeing as my personal iPhone 15 Pro Max is enrolled in the iOS 18.1 Developer Beta, I decided to take these three photo editing tools for a spin. Without going overboard, I only picked four different pictures for this round of tests. For reference, I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. Yes, I know Magic Eraser is built into the Google Photos app, but that would have taken away some of my fun. </p><p>Without further adieu, let&apos;s take a look at how each of these features stack up to one another. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="g2oEiXja5kVjXnN4k4MvKH" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-original-1.jpg" alt="Magic Eraser vs. Object Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up - Original" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2oEiXja5kVjXnN4k4MvKH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first picture, I chose something rather basic, aiming to remove the cars and signs in a view from my balcony on a recent trip to the beach.</p><p>What came as a bit of a surprise was that Apple Clean Up managed to do its best to ditch the cars that were parked in the street. Well, it&apos;s at least the most convincing of the three, as Magic Eraser inserted a random black patch in the road. Which is still better than Samsung&apos;s Object Eraser, as it decided to not only add the black patch but also thought that an overgrown bush was planted in the road.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3247px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.05%;"><img id="R25xKsPZHiX3koyPpjLrnC" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-1.jpg" alt="Google Magic Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up vs. Samsung Object Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R25xKsPZHiX3koyPpjLrnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3247" height="1268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple also gets points here for being able to remove both of the signs in the background without much hassle. For some reason, I couldn&apos;t get either Magic Eraser or Samsung Object Eraser to do anything with these.</p><p>Next up is a picture that I thought would be a great example of why you would want to use one of these features in general. Signs are great for providing information but aren&apos;t exactly ideal for when you&apos;re taking pictures. So this time, I decided to get rid of all of the signs besides the one in the top right corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.20%;"><img id="xgJduMvBnPdKubC8LG5ocL" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-original-2.jpg" alt="Magic Eraser vs. Object Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up - Original" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xgJduMvBnPdKubC8LG5ocL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="3008" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps this one was a bit too easy, as all three managed to get rid of the signs and the wooden fence without any trouble. Best of all, there&apos;s practically no artificating to speak of.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3247px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.05%;"><img id="WQpCLKLCV7YiPNjxU8uUqB" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-3.jpg" alt="Google Magic Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up vs. Samsung Object Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQpCLKLCV7YiPNjxU8uUqB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3247" height="1268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, instead, it just looks like an accidental picture on a path, as opposed to what the original image portrays.</p><p>Next up, I decided it was time to turn things up a tick, attempting to remove the lead and harness from a picture of my dog. I think this one speaks for itself. Oh, and if you&apos;re wondering why the Apple Clean Up image is so much brighter and washed out, it&apos;s because of a bug when taking screenshots of an HDR image. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="93CSQXBPfiDy4FgsZaQ3qJ" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-original-4.jpg" alt="Magic Eraser vs. Object Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up - Original" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/93CSQXBPfiDy4FgsZaQ3qJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3024" height="1700" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ignoring the cranked up brightness, your eyes aren&apos;t deceiving you. Instead of trying to fill in the gaps left behind by the harness, Apple&apos;s Clean Up feature opted to just slice my dog up. To be frank, it&apos;s rather unsettling to see, considering that Google and Samsung at least understood the assignment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3247px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.05%;"><img id="X5A6NFxSMwifsjx9CnStbA" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-4.jpg" alt="Google Magic Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up vs. Samsung Object Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5A6NFxSMwifsjx9CnStbA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3247" height="1268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you "pixel-peep," you can see that there is some artifacting in both of the other edited images. However, I&apos;ll take that all day over whatever Apple decided to do to my dog.  </p><p>Last but not least, I figured this picture from the view of my room on an earlier Summer getaway would be fun. It&apos;s a great picture, save for the sliding glass door divider that is annoyingly in the way.   </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="iTdjh6U6GDTum4KwxvYxnN" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-original-3.jpeg" alt="Magic Eraser vs. Object Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up - Original" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iTdjh6U6GDTum4KwxvYxnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="8064" height="6048" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another way to solve this would have been to go onto the porch, but there was a nest of spiders that I had no intention of disturbing.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t take long to recognize that Apple Clean Up did the worst job of the three. For some reason, it changed the shape of the top of the chair, while also getting rid of the armrest and legs completely. This also has the most artificating of the trio, making it seem like there&apos;s a non-existent glare.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3247px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.05%;"><img id="LwRvA8fZEZKY9mFvNUxDwD" name="google-magic-eraser-vs-apple-clean-up-vs-samsung-object-eraser-2.jpg" alt="Google Magic Eraser vs. Apple Clean Up vs. Samsung Object Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LwRvA8fZEZKY9mFvNUxDwD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3247" height="1268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Samsung&apos;s Object Eraser, it attempted to fill out the rest of the chair, doing a pretty okay job at it. But, I was surprised that in place of the beam, Samsung opted to add another opening in the woods bordering the lake. Meanwhile, Magic Eraser seemingly had a tough time with everything, as the trees don&apos;t look natural, and the chair looks like it&apos;s recovering from an unfortunate incident with a bonfire.</p>

<p>I must admit that I&apos;m surprised it took Apple this long to introduce such a feature, especially considering how much of a focus the company puts on photos and videos on the iPhone. Even still, it&apos;s interesting to see the feature arrive at all, given that you can already use Magic Eraser on practically any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphone</a>, provided that you rely on Google Photos and have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> subscription.</p><p>Of the three, between Samsung and Apple, I&apos;d probably put a bit more faith in Apple "getting it right" as opposed to Samsung. That&apos;s not to say that I don&apos;t want Samsung to continue trying to make improvements, but I believe Apple is better suited to work out the kinks.</p><p>I was also surprised to see Google&apos;s Magic Eraser struggle a bit, even with the curveball of the last image. But of the three, I&apos;m definitely going to stick with Magic Eraser whenever I need to get rid of some signs or remove some people from the background of my pictures.</p><p>The saving grace in all of this is that even if Apple&apos;s Clean Up feature fails spectacularly, not all hope is lost. For one, this only just arrived in iOS 18.1 Beta 3, so Apple should have plenty of time to make the necessary adjustments. So it&apos;s something to keep an eye on, but in reality, you should just download Google Photos and let Magic Eraser take care of the rest. </p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out a patch quite quickly following the initial start of its first QPR beta for Android 15.</p><p>The company detailed the minor Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1.1 patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1f495gq/android_15_qpr1_beta_11_now_available/">on Reddit</a>, which now includes the Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">the Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. Featured alongside the latest series are several past-gen devices ranging from the Pixel 6 series to the Pixel 8 series, the original Fold, and the Tablet.</p><p>Users enrolled in Android 15&apos;s first feature drop beta will see an OTA update marked as version <strong>AP41.240726.010</strong>. Google&apos;s patch notes this week are extremely light, as the update includes a fix for a critical Pixel issue. Labeled as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/361916913?pli=1">issue #361916913</a>, the minor patch fixes a problem that caused a "spontaneous" system restart for some devices.</p><p>The initial report stated that their device would randomly restart on its own when it wasn&apos;t in use. It also occurred quite frequently, prompting Google to cook up a fix and roll it out.</p><p>Despite how light the changelog is, users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1f495gq/comment/lkjkh0p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit report</a> that the update is around 4MB on devices <em>already </em>in the test. Those with a Pixel 9 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1f495gq/comment/lkjkvda/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">reported</a> a download size of around 445MB.</p><p>Google also informs users of the typical problems one might encounter during the test like stability, battery, and performance issues.</p>

<p>Google kicked off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1</a> last week, which was odd considering we don&apos;t even have its stable OS yet. The update was nearly 500MB as Pixel phones downloaded it for the first time. Specifics about what it entailed weren&apos;t specified; however, a change to Android&apos;s DND (do not disturb) was found shortly after.</p><p>Google is seemingly working on bringing more "priority" to DND through a new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-priority-mode-qpr1-detailed">Priority Mode</a>" setting. Hidden in the first QPR&apos;s code, users will have a way to create custom modes for this device as they tailor it to their needs. The option to "stay focused" was spotted alongside choices to filter interruptions from people, apps, alarms, and more.</p><p>A more pressing matter is Android 15 or, more specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-fall-launch-details-rumor">its stable version</a>. According to an alleged Google source, the company has held onto Android 15 as it works to iron out some stability problems following its beta conclusion. It was rumored to roll out in September, but Google may have<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-android-15-update-release-3475495/"> inadvertently confirmed</a> that it will roll out in October.</p>

<ul><li>You can now update multiple apps at once instead of one-by-one.</li><li>This fixes a long-standing issue of having to update apps individually, saving you time, though you can only install up to three app updates at once.</li><li>This feature is being rolled out server-side, so it might take a few days to reach everyone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Google Play Store has a new trick up its sleeve—now you can update a bunch of apps at once instead of one by one.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/28/google-play-store-multiple-app-updates-simultaneously/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> discovered a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a> feature that lets you download and install multiple app updates at once. We’ve seen this feature in action on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>, and some Pixel 7 Pro users have spotted it too.</p><p>This new feature finally tackles a long-standing hassle in the Play Store. Before, updating multiple apps on Android meant waiting for each one to finish individually, which was a real time sink.</p><p>This feature is already a staple on iOS, and like Apple&apos;s app marketplace, it only lets you update up to three apps at once, as seen in the screenshot below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:361px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.76%;"><img id="TKNq9rnf2cLxZNszvkRUiA" name="Google-Play-Store-multiple-app-update-installs.jpg" alt="installing up to three app updates on the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKNq9rnf2cLxZNszvkRUiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="361" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s interesting to note that the Play Store used to let you update multiple apps at once many years ago, but that feature disappeared for a while. Now, after a long break, Google has reintroduced this functionality, so keeping your apps up-to-date just got a lot easier.</p><p>Even though the three-app limit is a bit restrictive, it’s a huge upgrade from before, when you could only update one app at a time.</p><p>This new feature builds on the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-play-store-now-makes-downloading-multiple-apps-a-lot-faster">download several new apps at once from the Play Store</a>, a feature that was rolled out earlier this year. It might seem like a small tweak, but it really shines when you&apos;re setting up a new device or installing several apps.</p><p>A big win with these new features is the reduced time it takes to download and install updates (and new apps) on the Play Store, which means fewer disruptions while using your apps.</p><p>This new feature seems to be a server-side update, so Google is rolling it out slowly. That means it might not show up on everyone&apos;s device right away and could take a few days to become available.</p>

One of the more recent updates made it possible to use Google Keep to "Help me create a list." Of course, this is one of the more rudimentary use cases for Gemini and other AI services, but by being integrated into Keep, you have a few more options.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b8rSZbft2cuQ8gDjV4qcMC" name="how-to-use-google-keep-to-help-me-create-a-list-pixel-fold-1.jpg" alt="Google Keep "Help me create a list" on Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8rSZbft2cuQ8gDjV4qcMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When this was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">announced</a>, the "Help me create a list" feature was limited to those enrolled in Google&apos;s Workspace Labs. However, the company recently began making it available to more users, including those who weren&apos;t signed up for Workspace Labs.</p><p>There is a catch, as this feature isn&apos;t available to just anyone with an Android phone. Those with a Google Pixel phone should be able to use Gemini in Keep to generate lists without any hiccups. If you&apos;re using one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that doesn&apos;t come from Google, you&apos;ll need to have either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscription or be signed up for Google&apos;s Workspace Labs.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-google-keep-to-apos-help-me-create-a-list-apos-2">How to use Google Keep to &apos;Help me create a list&apos;</h2>
<p>1. Make sure you have the latest version of Google Keep installed.</p><p>2. Open the <strong>Google Keep</strong> app.</p><p>3. If prompted, tap the <strong>Got it</strong> button.</p><p>4. Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to create a new note.</p><p>5. Tap the <strong>Help me create a list</strong> button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.37%;"><img id="CSeRr3wc8Hapo9shhvRCwZ" name="how-to-use-google-keep-to-help-me-create-a-list-1.jpg" alt="How to use Google Keep to "Help me create a list" steps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSeRr3wc8Hapo9shhvRCwZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3250" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6. Enter a prompt describing the list you want to create.</p><p>7. After a few moments, the generated list will appear.</p><p>8. If everything looks good, tap the <strong>Insert</strong> button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.37%;"><img id="b49FbUJJhph7Su2G9R2LjZ" name="how-to-use-google-keep-to-help-me-create-a-list-2.jpg" alt="How to use Google Keep to "Help me create a list" steps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b49FbUJJhph7Su2G9R2LjZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3250" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While you can&apos;t make edits to the list from the preview window, you are able to make tweaks to the prompt before inserting it into Keep. Gemini also does the heavy lifting for you, as it ensures that the lists are properly formatted, removing the potential annoyance of needing to format the list yourself.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-is-being-infused-everywhere-2">Gemini is being infused everywhere</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SCFNHLKcqRLEKi2kQbvtjA" name="google-pixel-9-pro-gemini-live-grocery-list.jpg" alt="Using Gemini Live on the Google Pixel 9 Pro to make a grocery list" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCFNHLKcqRLEKi2kQbvtjA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite the rudimentary nature of using Gemini to create lists, it&apos;s still great to see Google integrating AI into more of its own apps. This also hopefully bodes well for Keep, as there have been concerns that Google would end up ditching this excellent app entirely.</p><p>Thankfully, that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case for now, and we&apos;re hoping to see more features added to Keep in the future. It would also be nice if it were possible to use Gemini to create a list and then have the list sent to Keep without needing to open the Keep app.</p>

<ul><li>Some Galaxy phones are experiencing paint peeling, mainly due to third-party chargers with poor grounding, as per Samsung.</li><li>Users on Reddit are reporting paint issues on Galaxy Z Fold 6, revealing metal beneath.</li><li>Using an EMS massager with the device might also cause paint problems, hinting at issues with power flow management.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung says some third-party chargers are causing the paint on some Galaxy phones to peel and blames poor grounding in these chargers as the cause of the damage.</p><p>A wave of online reports, mainly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/search/?q=paint&type=link&cId=6dc131d1-f54e-4379-b7e1-5926776d67a7&iId=9fef5bc0-e897-44b1-99fc-35548ef60133" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, claim that some users are noticing premature paint peeling on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> devices, revealing the metal beneath—a disappointing flaw for such a pricey device.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/support/mobile-devices/third-party-products-causing-paint-to-peel-off-galaxy-devices/" target="_blank">support page</a>, Samsung says that using a high-speed third-party charger with bad grounding can cause leakage current. This can mess with the anodic coating and lead to minor paint peeling.</p><p>Basically, a non-genuine charger messes with the paint’s protective coating, weakening the adhesive and causing peeling. Samsung says this mainly happens with low-quality chargers and shouldn&apos;t be an issue with Qi-standard ones.</p><p>However, Samsung&apos;s mention of the Qi standard, which is for wireless charging, seems odd since the problem is with wired charging.</p><p>Samsung’s fix is to suggest users charge their devices in a specific orientation to reduce the risk of damage.</p><p>More to the point, Samsung wants to nudge users to stick with genuine Samsung chargers, adding another cost on top of the already hefty price of the phone.</p><p>Quite intriguingly, Samsung adds that using an EMS massager with the device can cause similar issues, hinting that the problem might lie in how the device handles certain power flow setups.</p><p>Nevertheless, Samsung says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">reputable third-party chargers</a> that follow industry standards are usually safe. But the South Korean tech giant warns against counterfeit or low-quality chargers, which could damage the device by causing electrical leakage that corrodes its metal parts.</p><p>This issue is highly likely to raise doubts about Samsung’s choice to leave out the charger from the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and other devices, often pushing users towards cheaper third-party options.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Projectors are on the rise globally, and Yaber wants to take advantage of that. The Chinese manufacturer is a relatively new entrant to this category, but it made decent inroads over the last two years on the back of budget-focused options. The brand has ambitious goals, and its general manager Marshall Mao wants to establish Yaber as an entertainment powerhouse.</p><p>To that effect, the brand will roll out new products and venture into new categories, but before all of that, it is looking to increase market share in areas where it has an established presence. That&apos;s the narrative behind the introduction of the T2 and T2 Plus, two budget portable projectors that have a unique retro styling, powerful sound, and bright 450-lumen projection.</p><p>I tested a lot of portable projectors in recent years, and Yaber&apos;s T2 Plus is an intriguing addition not only because it has a lengthy list of exciting features, but also because it is one of the most affordable options in this category. I used the T2 Plus for just over a month now, and here&apos;s why I think it is a great option if you&apos;re looking for a budget portable projector.</p>

<p>Yaber unveiled the T2 and T2 Plus on June 25, and the projectors are now available globally. The standard T2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/yaber-projector-t2-t2-plus?variant=44166432751787">available for $299 on Amazon</a> (with $80 coupon), and you can also pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/yaber-projector-t2-t2-plus?variant=44166432751787">at Yaber&apos;s website</a>. The T2 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Yaber-Projector-Bluetooth-Portable-Compatible/dp/B0DD2SFDQG">retails for $349 on Amazon</a>, and the only difference between the standard model and the Plus variant is the Google TV dongle. If you already have a preferred streaming dongle, you can just get the regular T2.</p><p>Yaber says it&apos;s increasing its presence in the U.S., and as such, you can get the T2 Plus at Target, Walmart, and Best Buy — both online and retail storefronts. Yaber just introduced a Keith Haring limited edition variant of the T2 Plus with custom artwork on the sides and the handle, and that model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yaber.com/products/t2-special-edition">available for $399</a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-yaber-t2-plus-design"><span>Yaber T2 Plus: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HNkGMypaAfxdiVtsaLCpbE" name="yaber-t2-plus-4.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HNkGMypaAfxdiVtsaLCpbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most projectors broadly share the same design aesthetic, but that&apos;s not the case with the T2 Plus. Yaber did a great job with the design of the projector, and the cream color scheme combined with the retro styling gives makes it worthy of attention. If anything, it reminds me of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-horizon-ultra-4k-projector-review">XGIMI Horizon Ultra</a>, which costs five times as much.</p><p>Anyway, the styling doesn&apos;t suggest that the T2 Plus is a budget projector, and the build quality is pretty good too. The projector has a plastic chassis, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the overall fit and finish. There are vents at the front and back that ensures the projector doesn&apos;t overheat, and they&apos;re covered by a grille that blends in with the rest of the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uh9LGovYMJ3ru7HQLoNWXH" name="yaber-t2-plus-18.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uh9LGovYMJ3ru7HQLoNWXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s a fabric cover over a third of the chassis, and this is where the audio drivers are located. The fabric contrasts well with the plastic chassis, and gives the T2 Plus a lot of character. There&apos;s a power button at the top, and the usual Yaber branding. The only issue I have with the design of the T2 Plus is that it is bigger and heavier than other portable projectors I used, limiting its usability outdoors.</p><p>The gold-accented lens housing looks great, and Yaber bundles a lens cap with the package that&apos;s meant to protect the lens from any dust. That said, the cap isn&apos;t tethered to the projector, and it&apos;s easy to lose it — I have no idea where I left it. The T2 Plus has sensors at the front that handle auto keystone and focus, and there&apos;s JBL branding to highlight Yaber&apos;s collaboration with the audio manufacturer.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a decent amount of connectivity considering the T2 Plus is aimed at the budget category. You get an IR slot, USB port, HDMI, 2.5mm audio out, and Ethernet. I don&apos;t see the Ethernet port getting much usage on this device, but I&apos;m glad it&apos;s available. On the bottom left is the barrel port to connect the power cable; the T2 Plus has a built-in battery, but if you want to run the projector at maximum brightness or charge the battery, you&apos;ll need to plug it in.</p><p>A unique trait of the T2 Plus is the carrying handle; it allows you to easily take the projector anywhere. What&apos;s interesting is that the handle doubles as a stand, so if you need to project against a wall, you can just extend the handle downwards and angle the T2 Plus. This is a neat design idea, and I made good use of it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s9VeqfMpqd9xnbFmeWfw6J" name="yaber-t2-plus-20.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9VeqfMpqd9xnbFmeWfw6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yaber has a basic UI of its own, but instead of building a smart interface, it just decided to bundle a Google TV dongle in the box, and that&apos;s a sensible choice. The dongle is connected to a 90-degree angled HDMI connecter so it doesn&apos;t jut out at the back, and it can easily be powered by the USB port at the back.</p><p>The built-in battery lasts up to two hours on a full charge, and that&apos;s decent enough if you want to use it outdoors. The T2 Plus has other niceties, including auto keystone adjustment and autofocus, and setting up the projector is about as easy as it gets. Just connect the dongle, power up the projector, and you&apos;ll get the usual configuration flow to set up Google TV and link it with your Google account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iFwm8gJ8nqiWUWco9QFG5E" name="yaber-t2-plus-2.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iFwm8gJ8nqiWUWco9QFG5E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hassle-free usage makes a big difference, and the way Yaber handled the software is elegant. Other brands have had significant issues getting a Netflix license — this is still the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro</a> — and by offering an existing dongle instead, Yaber worked around the issue. </p><p>The interface itself is identical to any Google TV device, and while it isn&apos;t as fluid as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Shield TV Pro</a>, it doesn&apos;t have much lag in regular use. There&apos;s Google Assistant and Cast, so you can easily cast content to the device with your phone. The bundled remote is also decent, and overall, Yaber did a great job with the essentials.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WmnXPaAZREhEHpvPhQH4dG" name="yaber-t2-plus-13.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WmnXPaAZREhEHpvPhQH4dG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, you will need to connect a dongle to the back of the projector, and use a USB cable to power that. In a similar vein, while auto keystone does a decent job most of the time, it doesn&apos;t activate when the handle is down and the projector is inclined at an angle — you get a message that the sensor is obstructed. This is a pretty basic issue, and Yaber should have realized the positioning of the sensors would be a problem.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kKq7mQRSchzAUUsvsC5vpH" name="yaber-t2-plus-19.jpg" alt="Yaber T2 Plus portable projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKq7mQRSchzAUUsvsC5vpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yaber says the T2 Plus goes up to 450 lumen, and the projector does a great job in this area. It is brighter than most other portable projectors I tested, but you will need to plug it in to get the maximum brightness — just like every other model in this segment. I usually have a power station on hand to connect projectors as it&apos;s just convenient, and I recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ecoflow-river-2-max-review">EcoFlow River 2 Max</a> — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/EF-ECOFLOW-Portable-Charging-Generator/dp/B0CVZQ5RN1">costs $339 as of writing</a>.</p><p>Even with the built-in battery, the T2 Plus goes up to a decent brightness. Obviously, you can&apos;t use the projector if there&apos;s a lot of ambient light, but at night or with the blinds drawn, the T2 Plus comes into its own. The image quality is decent too, with good color vibrancy. It goes up to 1080p, and I didn&apos;t have any issues streaming YouTube or Netflix on the device.</p><p>The onboard sound is detailed and loud, and it doesn&apos;t distort at high volume. You can use the T2 Plus as a glorified Bluetooth speaker, and it&apos;s good enough at this particular task.</p>

<p>There isn&apos;t a shortage of portable projectors, and XGIMI&apos;s MoGo 2 Pro continues to be a solid choice in this category. It gets sufficiently bright, is noticeably smaller, and has good colors. The biggest issue with the projector is that it doesn&apos;t have a native Netflix client. The MoGo 2 Pro doesn&apos;t have a built-in battery, but you can easily power it via a 65W power bank.</p><p>If you need a built-in battery and Netflix, the Nebula Capsule 3 is a good alternative. It doesn&apos;t get anywhere as bright as the T2 Plus, but it is smaller, and has better battery life.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a portable projector with Netflix</li><li>You need good sound quality</li><li>You want a built-in battery that lasts two hours</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a projector to use in daylight</li><li>You want easy portability</li><li>You want reliable auto keystone correction</li></ul>
<p>Yaber didn&apos;t leave anything on the table with the T2 Plus. The projector has a great design, and while it is on the larger side, the carrying handle makes it relatively easy to move it around. The onboard sound is decent, and the battery lasts up to two hours.</p><p>The biggest reason to buy the T2 Plus is the image quality. The projector gets brighter than most of its immediate rivals, and you get vibrant colors with a decent amount of customizability. It still isn&apos;t ideal for daytime use, but it does a better job in this regard than the likes of the MoGo 2 Pro.</p><p>Yaber&apos;s decision to use a standard Google TV dongle means you get Netflix and all other streaming services without any hassle, and ultimately, the T2 Plus is a good all-round choice if you need a portable projector.</p>

<ul><li>OPPO's executive director, Zhou Yibao posted on Weibo a concept image of a tri-fold device.</li><li>The device seems to sport sharper, square corners, slim bezels, and (potentially) an under-display selfie camera.</li><li>Curiously, Zhou Yibao removed the Weibo post, but from its contents, it seems that OPPO plans to progress with the tri-fold form factor.</li><li>Huawei, Xiaomi, and TECNO also reportedly have tri-fold foldables in production.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The race for tri-fold phones heats up as yet another smartphone OEM states they have one in the works, too.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://innogyan.in/2024/08/29/oppo-triple-foldable-phone-officially-exposed/">innoGyan</a>, the executive director of OPPO, Zhou Yibao, took to Weibo to state that the company has its own tri-fold device in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_trifold_concept_showcased-news-64323.php">GSMArena</a>). From the concept image shared, the device features glossy hinge placements and a (potential) matte finish on its three rear panels.</p><p>It seems as though OPPO is leaning toward an in-display selfie camera. However, this is likely an early concept of what&apos;s in development, so it may not pan out that way. Other aspects suggest the phone could adopt a square form factor with pointed corners instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">rounded ones like its other foldables</a>.</p><p>The display also seemingly features very minimalistic bezels along the edges. This could make for quite an immersive viewing experience — especially with a screen that large. Zhou Yibao&apos;s photo doesn&apos;t expand on what the cover display may look like, nor does it show off the rear camera array.</p><p>Interestingly, OPPO&apos;s executive director removed the post from Weibo shortly after posting. Luckily, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-triple-screen-foldable-3476510/">Android Authority</a> states that Zhou Yibao "suggests" that the posted concept is one OPPO is moving forward with.</p><p>The device will (hopefully) see a "formal reveal" after the OEM reportedly wraps up other projects.</p>

<p>Tri-folds have been thrust into the spotlight ever since Huawei&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-tri-fold-phone-former-ceo-photographed">former CEO was spotted with it</a>. The device is rumored to feature a 10-inch display when unfolded and a tipster claims the one the former CEO held is "similar" to previous prototypes. The live photo shows the device with a far left-side selfie camera, as well.</p><p>While Huawei&apos;s tri-fold is rumored for a September reveal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">TECNO unveiled its version</a> officially two days ago on August 27. When folded, the company states users will experience a 6.4-inch display, but unfolding it reveals a 10-inch 3K OLED panel. Aside from small bezels, TECNO&apos;s device measures 11mm in thickness when folded. That is slightly thinner than Samsung&apos;s recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> as TECNO looks to take a leg up.</p><p>The announcement adds that the phone will adapt to how users are utilizing it so multitasking, wallpapers, and more feel more intuitive. TECNO&apos;s reveal was concept-only, meaning there&apos;s no information as to when we can expect it.</p><p>Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-tri-fold-phone-development-rumor">Xiaomi is working on a tri-fold phone</a>, reportedly, though this report was scant on details, aside from the fact that it might use the latest Snapdragon chip and the Leica camera system.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a sleek phone and have liked past efforts from Motorola; you want intelligent camera features, such as the incredible Motorola Horizon Lock.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need a telephoto camera that zooms in more than 2x; you want a newer device; you&apos;d rather go with something from the Samsung Galaxy lineup.</p><p>There&apos;s more than one reason why we considered the Edge Plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones#section-best-overall">best Motorola phone</a> last year, including its super-long battery life, high-powered performance, and the screen&apos;s 165Hz refresh rate, to name a few. Even if it is from last year, this phone holds up fairly well to the competition.</p><p>From our perspective, this was the best phone Motorola had released in a long time, and we always love seeing such an aesthetically pleasing device hit the market. Plus, Motorola&apos;s intelligent camera features like Horizon Lock, which intelligently stabilizes the horizon of captured video, make it fun to take pictures and video, even if there are a few odd limitations on 4K video recording.</p><p>If you&apos;re a fan of Motorola in general, then $300 off might be just the catalyst you need to try out the Edge Plus.</p>

<p>In case you can&apos;t be bothered to watch the video, all phones were cranked to max refresh rate, a Microsoft Teams meeting was joined, screen sharing mode was enabled, a 2160p YouTube video was played in picture-in-picture mode, Google Maps was set to navigate to the Dubai Mall, and all this is left running in the background whilst playing Asphalt 9. Yeah, it&apos;s totally normal things people do every day.</p><p>The verdict? Pixel 9 Pro XL handily beats the S24 Ultra because the S24 got too hot and crashed. And the Pixel couldn&apos;t do it without the sheer power of the mighty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Google Tensor G4</a>. In fact, the Pixel was as good or better than the iPhone and we know that the iPhone&apos;s chip is like a supercharged V8 engine running on jet fuel and nitrous oxide. </p><p>While you knowingly nod because you knew the Pixel was unbeatable, please remember the poor Galaxy S24 during this difficult time.</p>
<p>OK, I can&apos;t do this. It&apos;s all bullshit.</p><p>The video is real, and it happened just the way I described it, but it means absolutely nothing. Just like running benchmarks and saying something different means absolutely nothing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Let people enjoy doing it</a> if they like, but know that none of this makes any difference to anyone else.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re curious, this test shows that Google is doing a better job with thermal management than Apple and Samsung are doing. Certainly better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">previous Pixels</a>. That&apos;s not surprising because Google already said as much.</p><p>In the end, you&apos;ll find a phone for a particular thing if you want to buy it. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> from companies like Red Magic that are better equipped to play games than anything from Samsung or Google. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-samsungs-s-pen-work-so-damn-well">productivity phones</a> like the Galaxy S24. And there are AI phones like the Pixel 9.</p>
<p>One thing they all have in common is that the companies making them have a vision about what they want the product to do. Do not fool yourself into thinking that Google isn&apos;t capable of building a product that beats Samsung at running Geekbench tests. It just doesn&apos;t care because it thinks you won&apos;t care. Google, at least for now, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-im-sick-of-ai">all about AI</a> and designs its products to work well with the way it does AI.</p><p>That&apos;s what the Pixel 9 is: the Google AI phone. Doing some crazy stuff might make for an entertaining video, but it doesn&apos;t tell you that one product is better than another. Buy what you like and whatever does the things you want it to do.</p><p>And for God&apos;s sake, can we stop arguing about it?</p>
