<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One UI 7 is bringing big changes to how you handle notifications, with the latest beta introducing the 'Filter Notifications' feature.</li><li>This feature helps you sort your notifications into two categories: important ones stay at the top, and less urgent ones are tucked below.</li><li>Filtered notifications aren’t deleted, just moved to a section called 'Other Notifications,' which you can access by tapping the 'X more notifications' bubble.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s One UI 7, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, is likely to revamp how you interact with notifications, and the latest beta shows off a new feature that lets you take charge of your alerts and cut through the chaos.</p><p>Reddit user FragmentedChicken (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-filter-notifications-3511176/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>) uncovered a nifty new feature called Filter Notifications in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">second One UI 7 beta</a>, designed to make managing alerts way easier.</p><p>You can find this handy feature in the Settings menu under 'Notifications' and then 'Advanced settings.' It splits your notifications into two categories: important alerts go to the top, while less critical ones are tucked below. It’s a simple way to keep your priorities straight.</p><p>This feature is pretty cool because it gives you a lot of control. You can filter your notifications in three ways. "Old Notifications" hides alerts that are past their prime, usually a few days old. "Background Activities" cuts out notifications from apps running in the background, so you're not bombarded. Finally, "Minimized Notifications" keeps notifications you’ve already hidden from popping back up.</p><p>Notifications marked as 'Old,' from 'Background Activities,' or ones you’ve 'Minimized' are neatly moved to a section called 'Other Notifications.' When enabled, this section shows up as a separate tab below the main notification panel.</p><p>To be clear, filtered notifications aren’t deleted—they’re just tucked away in a small 'X more notifications' bubble at the bottom of the panel. If you want to check them out, just tap it, and they’ll pop up in one tidy list.</p><p>As shown in the screenshots below, when no filters are active, the KDE Connect notification from the background app appears front and center in the main panel. Once you turn on the 'Background Activities' filter, the KDE Connect icon moves to a 'more notifications' bubble. Tapping this bubble brings up all the filtered notifications, showing them in one place.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Smartphones</a> are everywhere, making life easier, but they also bring one major downside—the endless flood of notifications. With alerts constantly popping up from all sorts of apps, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lose focus.</p><p>The new Filter Notifications feature tackles this problem by sorting alerts based on importance. It’s a smart way to tidy up your notifications and make everything feel more organized.</p>

<ul><li>A new One UI 7 feature has been discovered, called "Camera Continuity."</li><li>With this feature, you'll be able to take a picture on your Samsung phone and immediately begin working on it from your computer or tablet.</li><li>There are some limitations, such as this feature only being available in Samsung Internet or Samsung Notes.</li></ul>
<p>It's been a few weeks since Samsung rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> for the Galaxy S24, and we're still learning about new features. The latest of which aims to provide even deeper integration between your Samsung phone, tablet, and laptop.</p><p>This upcoming feature is called "Camera Continuity" and is part of the "Continue on other devices" set of features. According to the screenshot provided by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-camera-continuity-3511168/">Android Authority</a>, this feature lets you "Take pictures and scan documents or handwriting on your phone or tablet, then continue working on them on another device such as a tablet or computer."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.20%;"><img id="RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5" name="camera-continuity-description-one-ui-7-beta-2" alt="Camera Continuity description in One UI 7 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RkoWERZ2aTzWZnMrfzsZB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">via Android Authority </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this seems to be yet another feature locked to Samsung's Galaxy ecosystem of devices. But the requirements to use Camera Continuity go even further. It's said to only be available when your devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth is turned on, and you are making use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones&ved=2ahUKEwjt37_pvcaKAxUQEVkFHSxSFusQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1fGe9iUCg4bRuMbaC3dbPX">Samsung phones</a>, tablets, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops&ved=2ahUKEwjk3YLwvcaKAxWIEVkFHQKTJN4QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ZtyQjyJS1P7ir0Bx9WtmW">laptops</a>, all of which are signed into the same Samsung account.</p><p>Oh, and on top of all of that, this feature is also expected to be limited to the Samsung Internet and Samsung Notes apps. None of this is all that surprising, given that these are the same types of requirements needed whenever using similar features on Samsung devices.</p><p>If anything, this is another "feather in the cap" for those who enjoy Samsung's ecosystem, and want to see more improvements. At first glance, Camera Continuity might seem a bit redundant, given that your images and files can already sync between devices. However, this could offer a more streamlined approach, as Samsung continues to provide the only true alternative to Apple's ecosystem and feature set.</p><p>While Samsung released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout&ved=2ahUKEwjrlrvbvcaKAxUBD1kFHRCLNNsQFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26dVWvJjSSPut3ztmAs21z">One UI 7 Beta 2</a> just a little over a week ago, it's still only limited to the Galaxy S24 lineup. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-it-matter-that-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-didnt-get-the-one-ui-7-beta">Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6</a> have been left out of the party so far, and we aren't expecting that to change. That being said, it's probably for the best as this seems to be Samsung's most ambitious update to One UI in years, and there are plenty of bugs still left to squash.</p>

Packed with a laundry list of features, Google's AI-powered chatbot can summarize long-form textual content, generate images based on the description you provide, have conversations with you, and do a whole lot more.</p><p>That's all well and good, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gemini" target="_blank">Gemini</a> is always learning from the information that is supplied to it. To that end, it saves everything—be it textual or spoken—by default. If you find that to be detrimental to your digital privacy, you'll be glad to know that it's quite easy to remove your activity from Gemini. Read on to find out how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-remove-your-activity-from-gemini-2">How to remove your activity from Gemini</h2>
<p>Gemini saves all of your activity (e.g., textual prompts, spoken commands) to your Google account. As such, you can manage and delete this information through your account's activity settings. However, do note that this is only possible if you have a personal account. On the other hand, <strong>if you use a work or school Google account with Gemini, all of your activity is always saved and can't be deleted</strong>.</p>
<p>1. Go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank"><strong>https://gemini.google.com</strong></a> to launch the Gemini web app. Now, tap the <strong>hamburger icon </strong>on the top left corner to access the <strong>slide-out menu</strong>, and then tap on the <strong>Activity</strong> option.</p><p>2. On the next page, tap the <strong>Delete</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) under the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section.</p><p>3. Finally, choose the time frame for which you want the activity to be deleted. You can pick from <strong>Last hour</strong>, <strong>Last day</strong>, <strong>All time</strong>, or specify a <strong>Custom range</strong>.</p><p>4. You can also remove all activity from a specific day, or even an individual activity. Simply tap the <strong>X</strong> icon corresponding to the day or the activity.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-activity-from-being-saved-and-changing-auto-deletion-settings-2">Turning off activity from being saved and changing auto-deletion settings</h2>
<p>1. Tap the <strong>Turn off</strong> button (with the <em>drop-down arrow</em>) against the <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> sub-section. You'll now get <strong>two options</strong>: just turn off the activity from being saved or do so along with deleting the existing saved activity. Choose the option that you'd prefer.</p><p>2. To change the auto-deletion settings, tap the arrow against the <strong>Deleting activity older than X months</strong> option. Here, you can <em>specify the time</em> (<strong>3</strong>, <strong>18</strong>, or <strong>36 months</strong>) for which the activity is kept before being automatically deleted. Tap the <strong>Next</strong> button and follow the on-screen instructions. You can also <strong>disable auto-deletion</strong> here.</p>

<p>As we move forward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/2025-the-year-ai-finds-purpose-on-phones-smartwatches-tablets" target="_blank">AI-based chatbots are going to play a pivotal role</a> in shaping our everyday interactions with smart devices. Gemini is already the default virtual assistant for all members of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> series, and there's little to no doubt it's going to come preloaded on almost all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> in the future.</p><p>Gemini's capabilities are bound to get better over time, and that's definitely exciting. However, it's also important to know how it's logging and using all of your data. Thankfully, Google makes it super simple to remove your activity from Gemini, so you're the one in control. Whether you want to delete select activity or all of it, you can do it with little to no effort. You can even have your activity deleted automatically after a specified time period.</p>

<ul><li>A new report suggests Samsung will show off the Galaxy Ring 2 and Galaxy AR glasses at Unpacked.</li><li>The Galaxy Ring 2 is said to offer better health accuracy, AI improvements, and longer battery life.</li><li>Little is still known about the Galaxy AR smart glasses, but are expected to compete with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</li></ul>
<p>We haven't even finished putting the Christmas presents away, and we're already learning more about Samsung's plans for its first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2025. According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241225PD216/samsung-galaxy-ar-smart-glasses-2025.html">DigiTimes</a>, Samsung will also show off the Galaxy Ring 2 and the company's AR smart glasses alongside the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>Samsung is expected to include a smattering of improvements with its second-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>. Some of those improvements are said to include updated sensors "to improve the accuracy of health data measurements," along with "new AI-related features."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvjS6S4572bpPFfsvUvArj" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvjS6S4572bpPFfsvUvArj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an effort to better compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a>, Samsung is also rumored to offer two additional ring sizes. Currently, the Galaxy Ring is only available in nine different sizes, ranging from 5 to 13. Meanwhile, sizes for the Oura Ring 4 range from 4 to 15. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-expansion-january-rumors">rumors</a> also suggested that Samsung wouldn't wait until the Ring 2 to start offering more sizes, with a Size 14 and 15 said to become available sometime in January.</p><p>After being released in July, Samsung's first smart ring was met with mixed reviews. Android Central's Nick Sutrich, Senior Content Producer, said in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">review</a> that although the "Galaxy Ring looks like a fantastic first-generation effort...the health tracking features feel amateur by nearly every measure." So if this latest report comes to fruition, it seems that Samsung might have been able to right the ship.</p><p>That's not all Samsung is said to be showing off during Galaxy Unpacked, as we could get our first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped">Galaxy AR Smart Glasses</a>. According to the report, these "resemble conventional eyewear with a weight of approximately 50 grams." With this, Samsung is aiming to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Glasses</a>, which currently dominate this segment of the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Limited-Edition-3" alt="Ray-Ban Meta limited edition transparent smart glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fqSRrLBJSDKzUtEA5fPNjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the only other details provided are that Samsung is working with both Qualcomm and Google on the development. This comes as little surprise given that the Galaxy AR Glasses are said to rely on the AI capabilities of Google Gemini.</p><p>In early December, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a> with Samsung making the first headset, named Project Moohan. Samsung provided a render of its headset as part of the official Android XR introduction, but it looks more like a traditional VR headset, and is far from what we would call "conventional eyewear."</p><p>Given the increasing number of recent rumors surrounding Galaxy Unpacked, we wouldn't be surprised to see more details leaked ahead of the official announcement. But until then, this gives a bit more to be excited about, besides the unveiling of Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>

<ul><li>Popular phone skin-maker Dbrand has started selling skins for the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>With the provided renders, we're able to see the rear camera layout and the flat edges.</li><li>After flattening out the edges on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Galaxy S25 Ultra finishes the job.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Galaxy Unpacked is expected to be less than a month away, meanwhile, more and more details are beginning to surface about the Galaxy S25 series. The most recent one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/galaxy-s25-ultra-skins">comes from Dbrand</a>, which has opened pre-orders for those who want to slap a skin on their new phone when it arrives.</p><p>This is technically the second series of devices that Dbrand has leaked in the past month after the company announced a new case for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, Dbrand stopped short of showing off the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra from all angles.</p><p>Instead, you can get a general idea of what to expect when going through the Galaxy S25 Skin Customizer tool. This doesn't really reveal much more that we haven't already seen. But what it does do is provide some additional confirmation that Samsung is ditching the rounded frame for good.</p>

<p>This is a trend we've seen across many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, adopting a true rectangular design, or "slab." The writing was on the wall that this same trend would come to Samsung's "Ultra" phone after the edges of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> were flattened a bit. However, these renders show that all three Galaxy S25 will share the same flattened design.</p><p>Besides that, it seems that Samsung won't be making any other changes, at least to the camera arrays. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> and Galaxy S25 Plus will look practically identical, with a trio of vertically-oriented cameras, flanked by an LED flash. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra again features a total of five rear cameras, with the flash sandwiched between the telephoto lens and the Laser AF Sensor.</p><p>There is one notable omission here, as there's no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">Galaxy S25 "Slim"</a> listed. This is the fourth S25 model rumored to launch this year, but it remains unclear whether the S25 Slim will debut at Galaxy Unpacked, or if it will arrive at a later date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's always possible that Dbrand is just using placeholder renders based on previous device leaks. However, we're less inclined to believe that to be the case given the variety of leaks that we've already seen.</p><p>With that being said, we also don't expect to be the last time we see or hear about the Galaxy S25 lineup. There's still plenty of time between now and Galaxy Unpacked, so if anything, we're likely to learn a lot more about Samsung's next flagship smartphones.</p>

The RedMagic 9S Pro is no exception—it’s a powerhouse packed with all the muscle you need for a seriously epic gaming experience.</p><p>The 9S Pro landed only a few months after its predecessor. It might just be a name change with an "S," but it packs an overclocked chipset, a new look, and improved cooling. It’s not a massive upgrade, but that’s expected since it’s more of a mid-year refresh than a full-on new phone.</p><p>If you’re new to the RedMagic brand, the 9S Pro won’t let you down if you’re after a top-tier gaming phone. Just be prepared for some ongoing software issues that can still be a bit annoying.</p>

<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro comes in four versions. The base Sleet model, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is priced at $649. The Cyclone and Snowfall models, both packing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, go for $799. And then there's the Frost model, which has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, also priced at $649.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro keeps the same pricing as the 9 Pro, with one key change: the addition of the entry-level Frost model.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of the RedMagic 9S Pro’s boxy design that’s both eye-catching and practical, and RedMagic fully owns it with those flush rear cameras. Right out of the box, you’ll notice its hefty, solid build—this thing feels substantial. It’s visually striking, something you don’t see much in phones these days. Best of all, it avoids the over-the-top, flashy look that plagues so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a>. It’s bold, sure, but there’s a clean, industrial vibe that’s hard not to love.</p><p>I have no gripes with this design approach. If you’ve used the RedMagic 9 Pro, the 9S Pro will feel right at home. It’s still a chunky, heavy phone, but that’s the price you pay for a massive 6.8-inch display and all the guts of the ICE 13.5 cooling system.</p><p>Sure, the weight might bug some people, and those sharp edges aren’t exactly hand-friendly, but it’s a seriously good-looking phone that feels rock-solid like it could survive a drop off a cliff.</p><p>The cooling fan lights up when it’s spinning but otherwise blends right in with the vertical camera stack. As for the shoulder buttons, they’ve got their own lighting, too, doubling as status or notification indicators. You can pick from seven colors and effects like flashing, breathing, or a steady glow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="7u2kU95Ejym3mnmNJD25yb" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-2" alt="Redmagic 9S pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7u2kU95Ejym3mnmNJD25yb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the coolest things here is the edge-to-edge display—no camera notch, no hole, just pure screen. The front camera is tucked under the display like RedMagic’s done before, and I love it because it lets your games take center stage. There’s a tiny bezel around the edges, with the bottom a bit thicker, but it’s so close to even you won’t really care.</p><p>The screen comes in at 1116×2480 pixels, which isn’t the highest resolution out there, but it’s spot-on for gaming. A lower resolution helps the GPU keep things running smoothly, so frame rates stay high. Plus, it’s sharp enough that even small text is easy to read.</p><p>The panel’s peak brightness of 1600 nits also isn’t the brightest out there, but it’s more than enough for comfortable outdoor use. In everyday situations, the display’s brightness held up just fine, rarely needing an extra boost.</p><p>The display has subtly rounded corners, and the edges are gently curved, making it more comfortable to hold. Plus, the pre-applied screen protector blends right in, so you don’t have to worry about putting one on yourself.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The seamless display is perfect for watching movies or TV shows and gaming.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>RedMagic has fine-tuned the 9S Pro with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Leading Version. This overclocked version of the already powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> boosts performance while keeping power usage in check. Plus, AI optimizations make the gaming experience even smoother and more responsive.</p><p>While the marketing hype around the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Leading Version sounds impressive, the real-world performance difference compared to the standard version is likely minimal. The overclocked chip does offer a slight boost, but in everyday use, you probably won’t notice much of a difference, especially with less demanding tasks. To really see what the chip can do, you’d need to put it through its paces with some heavy-duty Android games.</p><p>When you dive into games like Genshin Impact or other graphically demanding titles, the 9S Pro just powers through, thanks to the 1GHz Red Core 2 Pro gaming chip. In its highest performance mode, the 9S Pro consistently hit 60fps with zero crashes, stuttering, or loading hiccups. Animations were smooth, and every action felt instant. Even in intense gaming moments, there’s no slowdown, and the large display makes it easy to see and control everything.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro shines in gaming performance, but heavy sessions, especially with high-performance modes on, can make it heat up fast. To avoid discomfort, it’s a good idea to use a case or controller. Without them, the aluminum frame can get pretty warm after a while.</p><p>Many flagship phones with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 can struggle with heat and performance dips. However, the RedMagic 9S Pro’s advanced cooling system, including the active fan, allows it to maintain peak performance for longer. This means you get a smooth, responsive gaming experience, even during the most demanding sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Yxvk4rSgALEEAzrthLiKQa" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-9" alt="RedMagic 9S Pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yxvk4rSgALEEAzrthLiKQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro’s performance isn’t just about gaming—it shines in everyday use, too. Whether you’re scrolling through apps, switching between tasks, or handling more demanding apps, it does everything smoothly and effortlessly, showing off just how capable this device really is.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro’s internal fan runs surprisingly quietly, which is a big win for a high-performance gaming device. Considering how important it is for keeping temperatures in check, it’s impressive. The quiet fan makes the whole gaming experience better by cutting down on distractions and creating a more immersive environment.</p><p>The device comes loaded with a solid set of gaming features, building on what previous models already nailed. While a lot of these features will feel familiar to RedMagic fans, the brand keeps adding cool new stuff with each release. It’s definitely one of the most packed gaming toolkits on any phone.</p><p>One feature I really dig is the touch-sensitive triggers with built-in LEDs. They light up, making it way easier to find them during gameplay. And it’s not just for show—the LEDs also double as notification lights, which is a nice touch.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="iUAdZvdV5fBgggEdb3pPAF" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-5" alt="RedMagic 9S Pro cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iUAdZvdV5fBgggEdb3pPAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rear cameras on the RedMagic 9S Pro aren’t on par with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">Android camera phones</a>, but they do a solid job in good lighting. They’re more than enough for snapping everyday moments and social media content, covering the basic photography needs of a gaming phone.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro sticks with the same camera setup as its predecessor, focusing more on gaming performance than photography. While the camera has improved over time, it still lags behind dedicated camera phones, especially in image quality and versatility. That said, given the price, the camera does a decent job for most users.</p><p>You’re getting the same 50MP Samsung GN5 sensor that’s been in the last few models. It’s a solid camera, but it's not exactly groundbreaking or new.</p><p>The primary camera takes shots with slightly muted colors, and while it handles detail well in good lighting, shadows, and darker areas can look a bit blurry. The ultrawide camera struggles in low light, with less detail in the images. RedMagic applies distortion correction, but the results can still show some unnatural artifacts.</p><p>If there’s one major downside to Nubia’s all-screen design, it’s the 9S Pro’s 16MP under-display selfie camera. The selfies are pretty awful—detail, exposure, and dynamic range are all lacking, making it worse than even some budget phones with a regular front-facing camera.</p>

<p>Another thing that’s a bit annoying is how the front camera gives hazy shots because of the screen above it. It’s decent for quick calls or streaming with friends while gaming, but if you’re into taking selfies for Instagram or want something more polished, you’ll be let down.</p><p>On the software front, RedMagic’s software used to be a bit of a mess, but the company has come a long way in the past couple of years. These days, using a RedMagic device day-to-day is glitch-free and pretty enjoyable.</p><p>The RedMagic 9S Pro runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> with RedMagic OS 9.5 on top. While the interface can be a bit quirky at times, it gives you plenty of customization options to tweak things like themes, wallpapers, and menu colors to match your style.</p><p>Nubia claims that all models get "more than two years of software support" and promises at least one major Android update per year. However, it's unclear how long this will actually last. Compared to companies like Google and Samsung, which offer up to seven years of support, this feels a bit lacking.</p><p>At the end of the day, you’ve got to make some trade-offs to keep a $649 price tag on a phone with the latest Snapdragon. But when it comes to gaming, the RedMagic 9S Pro absolutely delivers, and that’s what really matters.</p>

<p>Nubia and ASUS are usually at the top of our gaming phone rankings, so the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9</a> series might catch your eye. But if you’re not looking to break the bank, the ROG Phone 8 from last year is still a beast and a way better deal.</p><p>The ASUS ROG Phone 8 might not be the newest model, but it’s still a solid pick. While it might not have the same bang-for-your-buck appeal as the RedMagic 9S Pro, its better software support, improved camera, and more comfortable design make it a great all-around gaming phone. You can also go for the beefier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-review">ROG Phone 8 Pro</a> if you want a little more power.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a> is a solid competitor in the budget gaming phone category, offering impressive value for its price. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset delivers performance on par with the RedMagic 9S Pro and even beats it with 120W fast charging. However, it falls short in the gaming department without features like dedicated cooling and shoulder triggers, which are a must for hardcore mobile gamers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-9s-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>RedMagic 9S Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HkJVrqWktYESh72aAvPMXX" name="RedMagic-9S-Pro-7" alt="Redmagic 9S Pro screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HkJVrqWktYESh72aAvPMXX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're after a solid value phone with great performance and an enormous battery.</li><li>You prefer a phone that stays cool even during those marathon gaming sessions.</li><li>You want a phone that lasts all day and charges up in no time.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should not buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're after top-notch camera performance, since the RedMagic 9S Pro might not be your best bet.</li><li>You're not a fan of generic-looking interfaces.</li><li>Limited software support is a dealbreaker for you.</li></ul>
<p>The RedMagic 9S Pro is a powerhouse when it comes to gaming, with hardware that can handle even the most demanding tasks without breaking a sweat. Its advanced cooling system keeps things cool, while the overclocked chipset ensures smooth, lag-free performance in even the most intense gaming sessions. It's easily one of the most powerful smartphones out there right now. But it’s not just about gaming. The 9S Pro also delivers a solid all-around package, featuring a classic headphone jack, a stunning OLED display, and a big battery with fast charging to keep you in the game longer.</p><p>While the RedMagic 9S Pro is a beast when it comes to gaming, it doesn’t quite shine as an all-around smartphone. The lack of an IP rating and its underwhelming camera performance might be dealbreakers for those looking for a phone that excels in both gaming and everyday tasks. Sure, it offers solid value compared to premium flagships and gaming phones like the ROG Phone 9, but its durability and photography shortcomings might hold it back from claiming a top spot in the broader smartphone market.</p><p>If you're not too fussed about the camera or software quirks, and you're just after a beastly gaming phone with cool stuff like built-in cooling and air triggers, the RedMagic 9S Pro is a solid pick. It's a bit of overkill, but it’s a lot cheaper than the newer ROG phones and still delivers serious performance. If gaming is your top priority, you can’t go wrong here.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've been a VR gamer for a solid decade now and can confidently say that 2024 was VR's best year ever in some ways but the worst year in others. We got massive new releases like Batman Arkham Shadow — the first Batman Arkham game in a decade — Skydance's Behemoth, Metro Awakening, and a slew of other truly amazing games that now grace the best Meta Quest games list.</p><p>However, we also have less competition than ever, with Meta ruling the roost with 74% of the market share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-xr-ar-vr-headsets-market-share-quarterly">according to Counterpoint Research</a>. The two major alternative players, Pico and Sony, saw a substantial drop in market share this year, and Apple's Vision Pro failed to make a splash because of its ridiculous price point.</p><p>Ironically enough, this was also the year that Meta announced it was opening up its OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">becoming the Android of XR</a>, announcing that new headsets with Xbox, Asus ROG, and Lenovo branding would be coming in 2025. Essentially, that shows that the market continues to shift prominently to standalone headsets, while PC and console-attached VR headsets will almost certainly remain the minority for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2 id="big-names-big-gains-2">Big names, big gains</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5XRHTKSC3eyssDa4etAUjf" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-hero-art2" alt="Official Batman Arkham Shadow artwork juxtaposed with a face wearing a Meta Quest 3 overtop Batman's face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5XRHTKSC3eyssDa4etAUjf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta / Camouflaj / Nicholas Sutrich)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Batman Arkham Shadow's announcement trailer debuted in May, it received plenty of harsh criticism from Arkham fans. But many people who took the time to try it were surprised by how good it was even despite not being developed by the original Arkham team.</p><p>Likewise, the reception to Metro Awakening and Skydance's Behemoth has been incredibly solid, successfully pulling a new wave of VR gamers off the couch and into the experience. Previous AAA-grade titles have failed to garner this sort of reception, and it remains to be seen whether Meta and other developers will be able to keep these gamers satisfied in 2025.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Proven VR-only development studios were carefully chosen to translate each AAA IP's unique game mechanics and atmosphere into VR and each game benefitted brilliantly from this choice.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> we know of in 2025 include the likes of Alien Rogue Incursion, the first official Alien-branded made-for-VR game, and it's entirely likely we'll continue to see more big-name titles make their way to VR platforms in 2025.</p><p>All of the big-name VR games released in 2024 have something in common, too: none of them were developed by the original developers of each respective IP. Instead, proven VR-only development studios were carefully chosen to translate each title's unique game mechanics and atmosphere into VR, and each game benefitted brilliantly from this choice.</p><p>This is hugely promising for VR gamers as it means that larger publishers and development houses will likely repeat history, especially now that we're seeing more hardware come to market from brands like Xbox and Asus ROG.</p>
<h2 id="king-meta-2">King Meta</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="srdnjh2MrjxViWjyDPn6k5" name="meta-quest-3-with-meta-logo.jpg" alt="A Meta Quest 3 headset outfitted with a BoboVR M3 Pro headstrap behind the Meta logo on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/srdnjh2MrjxViWjyDPn6k5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Meta has proven anything, it's that it'll continue to remain the king of XR going forward. Meta had the most successful pair of smart glasses in 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, and the launch of the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> is proving to be a success if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269726126581678081/">estimates from Black Friday weekend</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>Pico never got a good foothold in the market because of U.S. trade relations with China. It is owned by Bytedance, the controversial parent company of TikTok, which made it impossible to officially sell in the country. Pico has done OK elsewhere in the world but still represents less than 10% of headset sales in the most recent quarter per Counterpoint Research's data.</p><p>Likewise, Sony's lack of substantial support for its PlayStation VR2 headset meant that sales continued to dwindle throughout the year. We don't have numbers for how well the headset sold through Black Friday weekend but no news isn't good news, in this case.</p><p>But not everything is a sad story.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is launching Android XR in 2025, but there's seemingly no hardware ready for the fledgling new platform. Google says this is the first Android "built for the Gemini era," complete with some impressive-looking new user interface concepts that could very well revolutionize how we interact with XR devices in the future. We'll have to wait for an actual market-ready device first, though, which may likely come from Samsung with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Project Moohan</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google and Valve could potentially disrupt the VR market in huge ways in 2025, leading to some exciting possibilities.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Valve's standalone VR headset — known currently as Valve Deckard — could disrupt the VR market in an important way, similar to how the company disrupted the portable console market with the Steam Deck two years ago.</p><p>Rumors for Deckard have been going around for what feels like years, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864827388682543501">latest leaks and rumors</a> show that Valve is working on a new SteamOS-based product and new VR controllers. Steam is a fan-favorite content distribution network and is largely considered the most consumer-friendly digital marketplace on the planet.</p><p>With that kind of mindshare, Valve could make huge waves in the VR market if it finally debuts its long-awaited standalone hardware. Otherwise, considering the momentum Meta has built up along with its new hardware partners, it's looking like a Meta headset is still the best place to play VR in 2025.</p><p>Not only that, but Meta's lead in smart glasses and multimodal AI makes the company the most likely to continue to push the limit on what we are expecting from VR and even XR, as a whole. Google has a real chance of disrupting the market in 2025, but Meta is the most likely company to deliver on promises and expectations next year and beyond.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta needs to work on better curating the immense content it has instead of promoting Horizon Worlds so much.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta needs to work on better surfacing and curating the games that are available on its platform, as the indies that mostly power the platform's content tend to get buried by Meta's own Horizon Worlds Metaverse promotions. Much of the industry's success and future is riding on Meta's ability to manage the lead it currently has, but the company hasn't always shown it makes the best decisions in the interest of the developers that support it.</p><p>However, the video game market's slow decline in 2024 isn't likely to let up in 2025 unless some important economic factors change. This means that sales across the board — whether we're talking PS5 games or Meta Quest headsets — will likely be lower than in prior years.</p><p>Several developers closed their doors in 2024 because of this, and I don't necessarily think that trend will change in 2025. I don't think this will affect the number of big-name games Meta and others are sure to reveal throughout the year, but it might mean some of your favorite games could close up shop if player numbers don't improve.</p><p>It's a tough market out there, and while 2025 isn't likely to improve much, it will also help players strengthen their business models and remain resilient through difficult periods in the future. Whoever is left standing at the end of 2025 will, no doubt, take in the lion's share of the winnings going forward.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Gemini Advanced's Deep Research feature was first announced for users early this month for English language.</li><li>The feature is now being expanded to more languages and regions.</li><li>Deep Research allows users to explore complex topics and convert them to an easy-to-read report within minutes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out impressive upgrades for its Gemini, and as part of the upgrade, it also announced a new tool dubbed Deep Research for Gemini Advanced users, which is now expanding to more countries and in additional new languages.</p><p>Deep Research is a personal AI research assistant tool for Gemini AI users, and it is now available in over 45 languages and across 100 countries worldwide, the company announced for Gemini Advanced users just before the holidays. Users can try it by selecting "Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research" from the Gemini Advanced drop-down menu.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gemini_Deep_Research_v13.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Gemini_Deep_Research_v13.mp4"></video></div>
<p>Deep Research aims to save hours of time by "deeply analyzing relevant information from across the web," making the AI assistant even more helpful than it already is.</p><p>For instance, if you raise a question, Deep Research "creates a multi-step research plan for you to either revise or approve. Once you approve, it begins deeply analyzing relevant information from across the web on your behalf."</p><p>The new feature will try to explore complex topics and convert them to a more comprehensive and easy-to-read report, which can further be exported to your Google Docs.</p>
<p>The organized report will also include links with original sources, relevant websites, or businesses if users want to dive in further for more details. Since it’s an AI assistant, users can further ask follow-up questions or ask it to refine, and it will generate reports within minutes.</p><p>The search giant began the Deep Research rollout early this month for Gemini Advanced users on Desktop and mobile web. While the initial rollout was for English-speaking users, the latest announcement adds languages and more countries as aforementioned. The Gemini mobile app users, however, can expect the feature rollout as early as next year, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">announcement blog post</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Asian handset market is very interesting, with a significantly broader range of devices sold in the region than anywhere else. You have the usual Chinese contingent of Vivo, OPPO, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Honor dominating sales, but Samsung and Google also sell most of their products in Asian markets, and Apple is slowly building momentum with the iPhone.</p><p>I used over 70 phones over the course of 2024, and while there were devices that didn't measure up to their asking price, I didn't run into any bad phones as such. The one brand that stood out the most to me is Vivo. It delivered truly incredible cameras in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a>, and it made heady gains in the mid-range with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v30-pro-review">V30 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a>, delivering much better sensors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QdMVVBmc8NXnVneLTRuqpD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QdMVVBmc8NXnVneLTRuqpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, I'm not the only one who liked the brand's progress, as Vivo managed to extend its lead in both China and India considerably. Vivo is likely to continue that momentum in 2025 on the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>. As much as I like the X200 Pro, I'm waiting to see what the X200 Ultra brings to the table. Vivo doesn't actually need to change much with the device, but if it manages to retain the same set of cameras while making the phone available in at least select regions outside China, it will be a monumental achievement.</p><p>While the V series is stronger than ever, the upgrades with the V40 Pro pushed it closer to value flagships, and Vivo needs to focus on the Y series to maintain its mid-range presence. I'm excited to see what's in store with the V50 and V50 Pro, and whether they can deliver the same caliber of photos as the X series.</p>

<p>Although OPPO lost ground in China, it solidified its position as the second-largest handset brand in India on the back of the Reno 12, K series, and A series devices. While I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> quite a bit, I don't think OPPO has the cachet to steal market share from Apple and Samsung just yet, but its introduction in additional global markets should give OPPO a decent platform on which to build. The one issue I have with the X8 Pro is that it doesn't have the best cameras the brand makes, and that will inevitably debut on the X8 Ultra sometime in Q2 2025. Just like with Vivo, the X8 Ultra needs to launch globally to make the cameras accessible by a wider audience.</p><p>OnePlus, meanwhile, is doing all the right things. Although the manufacturer lost market share in 2024, its device portfolio is stronger than ever, and the imminent global launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> should allow the brand to take on Samsung and Google. What I like is that the R series is also sold globally, and with the OnePlus 12R still one of the best mid-rangers available today, I'm intrigued to see what the 13R can deliver. I just want to see the device continue to deliver the same value-focused ethos, and with the manufacturer confirming a class-leading 6000mAh battery, it has the potential to do incredibly well.</p>

<p>Xiaomi continues to do well thanks to its budget-focused portfolio, but that narrative has changed in recent years as it shifted to the mid-range with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus</a>. In doing so, Xiaomi is effectively ceding ground to its rivals, and that's one of the reasons why it is no longer in the top position in India. The brand needs to rethink its strategy and go back to delivering budget phones with strong value — that just hasn't been the case in the last two years. Honestly, Xiaomi needs to do an overhaul of its devices, and rethink its strategy. That's the only way it can retain its footing against its rivals, but I don't see the brand doing so in 2025. <br><br>I really like what Honor is doing these days; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> are two of my best phones of the year — with the latter being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> around — and the brand is taking a radically different strategy to everyone else, positioning itself as a premium player to stand out. While that may not yield market share, Honor certainly takes up a lot of mind share, and with the brand regaining its foothold in India, 2025 should be a pivotal year for its global ambitions. The Magic 7 Pro is launching shortly, and I'd like to see the device delivering better cameras; while the 6 Pro was great in its own right, it didn't quite measure up to the X100 Pro, and Honor needs to be on the same level as Vivo.</p><p>I usually turn to a Pixel as my daily driver, and that hasn't changed in 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is a worthy upgrade, and while it costs more, it has meaningful changes across the board and takes brilliant photos. The only issue with the device is that the hardware isn't on par with its rivals, although that may change in 2025. Google is set to switch away from Samsung's designs and go with MediaTek, which means that the Pixel 10 should be noticeably better in this regard. The biggest thing that Google needs to change with the Pixel 10 is the internal hardware; the Tensor platform may be good in mid-rangers, but it just doesn't measure up against what Qualcomm and MediaTek are doing in the high-end category, and Google needs to do better. The latest leaks point to the brand doing just that with the Tensor G5, but I want to get my hands on the device to see how it actually holds up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="73x7gcW9ErcFKC7Z7FdFuD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/73x7gcW9ErcFKC7Z7FdFuD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Samsung, the brand lost ground in India and other Asian markets this year, and that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">down to its own shortcomings</a>. While it built up an early lead in foldables, the lack of any meaningful innovation has allowed Chinese brands to eat into its market share, and Samsung is losing ground in the mid-range as well. What's interesting is that the brand is positioning the FE devices as its value-focused models in major regions like the U.S. instead of traditional bestsellers like the Galaxy A55, and I don't think that's the best move. While high-end devices contribute to Samsung's bottom line, it's the mid-range where the brand sees a bulk of its sales, and it needs to bring its best devices to all regions.</p><p>Like much of the last decade, value-focused phones will dominate sales in 2025, but there is a growing demand for mid-range and even high-end devices, and that's encouraging to see. With all major manufacturers introducing their products earlier than before, we don't have to wait as long to see what's in store with the best 2025 phones, and that's always a good thing.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>In many ways, 2024 was one of the best years for smartphones in a long time. While you could pick out several other innovations made in years prior, 2024 marked an important year where phones debuted more eye-friendly displays, finally adopted years of promised software updates, got overheating under control, and moved toward more consumer-friendly practices like better repairability.</p><p>But I'm not confident that 2025 is going to be quite as good. Patent disputes between Samsung and BOE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www-thelec-kr.translate.goog/news/articleView.html?idxno=31229&_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp">are heating up</a>, threatening to get BOE displays banned here in the States. For me, that's particularly concerning because Samsung AMOLED panels typically use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, which gives me headaches and makes it impossible to use these types of displays long-term, while BOE panels are far more eye-friendly.</p><p>We're also seeing design convergence go back to the "iPhone is best" model among OEMs, something that hasn't happened en masse in a very long time. I don't just mean the overly flat hardware design, either. Samsung's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">OneUI 7 looks more iPhoney than ever</a>, and companies have been slowly introducing iPhone designs like split notification shades and the Dynamic Island to Android phones in the latest software updates.</p><p>Of course, some of these trends are positive ones, but they could largely mean that 2025's best phones end up all looking and feeling the same in North America, and that's something I'd rather avoid.</p>
<h2 id="be-together-not-the-same-2">Be together, not the same</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphones in North America — particularly in the U.S. — are mainly bought through someone's carrier of choice. Whether that's Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, or one of the many smaller carriers or MVNOs, carriers are often the most affordable way to get a new phone. Because of that, U.S. customers mainly buy from four brands: Apple, Samsung, Google, and Motorola.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/us-smartphone-market-share/">Counterpoint Research</a>, less than 10% of U.S. customers buy from other brands, a direct side effect of this buying model. As such, companies like Nothing, CMF, OnePlus, Nuu, Blu, and several others have a hard time making significant gains. Most China-based OEMS like vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Honor aren't even officially sold in the U.S., further complicating matters, but more on that in a bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9yCUKsdmLFNTQDP3zvjnNE" name="iphone-14-pro-max-oppo-find-x8-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-nothing-phone-2a" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, Oppo Find X8, Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, and Nothing Phone 2a next to each other with nearly identical designs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yCUKsdmLFNTQDP3zvjnNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Which phone is which? Good luck telling them apart from most angles. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once upon a time, Android's slogan was "Be together, not the same." It proved a point that Android phones might all look different, but they share the same core experience and apps, giving users true choice without sacrificing the apps or services they love.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>From the rumored Samsung Galaxy S25 to the recently launched Google Pixel 9 series, many phones now look just like iPhones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Looking forward to the 2025 North American smartphone market reveals less choice than ever, and even the few players in the market seem to be converging around a master hardware design language that feels uninspired and wholly utilitarian. From the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> to the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, many phones now just look like an iPhone.</p><p>Many people seem to prefer flat front glass on their phones, if for no other reason than it makes finding a tempered glass screen protector easier. Unfortunately, most Android phones in the U.S. have (or will have) ultrasonic fingerprint sensors in 2025, which are sometimes faster and more accurate — although that depends highly on the person.</p><p>The issue is that many tempered glass screen protectors render ultrasonic fingerprint sensors useless. They simply don't work at all when a protector is over top. Seems like it defeats the point, doesn't it?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh" name="OnePlus-13-launch-teaser.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 launch tease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XSzAZDXTpRYXADiJvSPikh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This makes product testing more important than ever, particularly since the biggest advantage of a flat display is that it makes adding a screen protector easier. No modern Android phone does advanced facial recognition, as Google tried to push back on the Pixel 4 line, so good fingerprint sensor performance is extremely important for a good user experience.</p><p>I'm not convinced the current hardware design trajectory is entirely a good thing, but that's why we have to have alternatives. OnePlus and Motorola continue to be the biggest alternatives available to Samsung, Google, and Apple, which is a great thing, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">the big three aren't prioritizing eye health</a> the way they should.</p><p>Some new entries into the more affordable phones market in 2024 have me confident in this sector for 2025. Nuu and CMF both delivered fantastic entries under $300, bringing back the feeling that you can still buy a good phone without spending $500, $1000, or even more. My hope is that these two companies — plus a few others — continue this trajectory through 2025 and buck the trend of more expensive phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-china-quotient-2">The China quotient</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ" name="vivo-x100-ultra-26.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hyet8kTDnvDvroVXqHRHoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The U.S. government continues to wage economic war on China, and with that, a wave of new tariffs and bans are expected to come forward in 2025. While this is appealing from a "domestic" standpoint, the problem is that nearly all the real competition for Google, Samsung, and Apple is from China. Lenovo, a China-based company, owns Motorola. BBK, a China-based group, owns OnePlus.</p><p>From my perspective, the two best hopes here are Nothing — as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Nothing's sub-brand CMF</a> — and Nuu. Nothing is based in London, and Nuu is based in Hong Kong. There are other brands that could deliver good alternatives in the wake of a full China product ban, but these two are the shining gems, in my estimation.</p><p>From what I can tell at the moment, a "full ban" won't happen, but I fully expect price increases on phones from Chinese brands, particularly in the U.S.</p><p>Given that these companies are among the few keeping prices low, I would hope that lawmakers take a moment to think of other economic repercussions before making sweeping legislation.</p>
<h2 id="better-performance-than-ever-2">Better performance than ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long, long time, Android has been a sort of "second-class citizen" when it comes to performance versus Apple silicon. Last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 was the closest we've ever been to Apple-like performance on Android phones, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite in upcoming 2025 phones is the first time <em>ever</em> that we've seen Snapdragon chips eclipse Apple's latest in most metrics.</p><p>That's beyond exciting, to say the least, and it was achieved by Qualcomm unifying its chipsets across mobile and laptops. In other words, we're getting laptop-grade performance out of our 2025 flagship phones. Now that's a massive upgrade!</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Tensor G5 could finally bring Pixels the performance boost they've needed in 2025.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not only that, but it's said that Qualcomm has done a better job of keeping thermals in check all while delivering better performance. The last two times we saw a big shift in the naming convention and processor design — that's the Snapdragon 810 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 — things didn't go so well and chips regularly overheated. Based on what we know, the third time seems to be the charm for Qualcomm.</p><p>Google Pixel phones are finally in for a big performance upgrade in 2025, too, if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">Tensor G5</a> leaks are anything to go by. It's been said for years that Google till be moving to TSMC for Tensor G5 instead of using Samsung cores, and that G5 is the first "fully custom" Tensor chip.</p><p>Previous generations were built on Exynos technology and it regularly felt like it. Tensor G4 performance in the Pixel 9 series is akin to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 which, as you can guess, is now 3 full generations behind what Qualcomm just released.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-folding-phones-2">The future of folding phones</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SKUr5PNUfgSteGYfKDjmX6" name="2024-phone-pile-14.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SKUr5PNUfgSteGYfKDjmX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to cover the state of folding phones and what 2025 holds for them. We've already seen rumors that one major player <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-and-oneplus-are-crucial-to-foldable-market">is pulling out of the folding phone category</a>. Fewer players are always worse for competition, but folding phones remain a relatively small portion of even the biggest phone manufacturers' earnings statements, so it's not much of a surprise to see one company potentially pulling out.</p><p>From my point of view, folding phones are already excellent, and 2024 proved to be the best year yet for the segment. While we didn't get a follow-up to the OnePlus Open, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> both surprised me in the best ways.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>2024 was a great year for folding phones, but with one player rumored to leave the space, 2025 is feeling a little uncertain.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the Flip-side, Motorola continues to impress with its Razr reboot.  Motorola has consistently delivered excellent hardware design, superb battery life, surprisingly good cameras, and the very best flip phone software on the market, plus a new commitment to providing long-term updates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, though, I'm not feeling the best about 2025, even if there are still some bright spots here in the U.S. market. Carriers continue to have a stranglehold on the country's phone distribution systems, and smaller players have a hard time getting a foot in the door because of it. If there's any kind of change needed here, it's to help move people away from carrier dependence so we can have better choices for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 is already available in China, and it's just weeks away from a global launch. Naturally, that means it's just about time for current OnePlus phone owners to think about whether the upgrade is worth it.</p><p>If you happen to own a OnePlus 11 device, that's a complicated decision. With a better display, processor, and camera system, the OnePlus 13 certainly has the edge over the OnePlus 11. However, considering the latter already has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and will get two more Android OS upgrades, upgrading from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-11-review">OnePlus 11</a> isn't absolutely necessary.</p><p>Are you curious how the two phones will compare when the OnePlus 13 debuts globally in January? We're about to break down how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and the OnePlus 11 stack up against one another and hopefully help you decide whether it's time to upgrade.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, OnePlus phones have come a long way in two short years. The OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 13 might loosely resemble each other from afar, but the differences are evident up close. Some might be hard to see, too — the OnePlus 13's IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 durability</a> ratings crush the IP64 certification of the OnePlus 11, for example.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus 13 is bigger than the OnePlus 11. It sports a 6.82-inch AMOLED display, whereas the OnePlus 11 features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display. They'll look similar on the spec sheet — both phones have LTPO AMOLED panes supporting 120Hz refresh rates — but they're very different. Notably, the OnePlus 13 has a 4,500-nit peak brightness rating, and the OnePlus 11 can only hit 1,300 nits. The OnePlus 11 has a slightly curved display, while the OnePlus 13 has a completely flat panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aUSAEc3pF6Up5neE4fSKuK" name="oneplus-11-16.jpg" alt="OnePlus 11 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUSAEc3pF6Up5neE4fSKuK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of dimensions, the OnePlus 13 measures 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5-8.9 mm and the OnePlus 11 measures 163.1 x 74.1 x 8.53 mm. That means the OnePlus 11 will be both thinner and lighter than some variants of the OnePlus 13. The former weighs 205 grams, and the latter weighs between 210 and 213 grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1780px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.72%;"><img id="kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo" name="op-13.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXpp9EmL82wDhEaQqiutEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1780" height="885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design of the OnePlus 13 may be more visually appealing to some, with a circular camera bump that doesn't flow into the side rails of the chassis like the OnePlus 11. The OnePlus 13 comes in Black Eclipse, Midnight Ocean, and Arctic Dawn colorways, and the OnePlus 11 is available in Titan Black and Eternal Green. You can read more about the OnePlus 13 design in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/exclusive-onepluss-head-of-industrial-design-on-delivering-the-best-in-hand-feel-with-the-oneplus-13">exclusive interview with OnePlus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-11-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 11: Hardware and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bigger differences may come from what's on the inside. In some ways, the OnePlus 11 holds its own entering 2025. It has 5G, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and NFC for connectivity — enough to hang with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android flagships</a> of 2024. It'll fall short in other key areas, like the UFS 3.1 storage for the base model. Most importantly, the OnePlus 11 lacks wireless charging. It was a glaring omission when the phone launched, and that missing feature has only made the device less appealing as it ages.</p><p>It doesn't exactly get better when the two devices' processors are compared. The OnePlus 13 is powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which uses the company's custom Oryon cores for superb performance. It'll crush its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, and even more so, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> that powers the OnePlus 11. The upgraded configuration of the OnePlus 11 with 16GB RAM better competes with the OnePlus 13, which comes with up to 24GB RAM. However, the newer model is better in every way when performance is considered.</p>

<p>Aside from the lack of wireless charging, the OnePlus 13 also beats the OnePlus 11 in terms of battery capacity and charging speeds. The OnePlus 13 can do 100W wired fast charging while refilling its 6,000mAh-capacity battery. Meanwhile, the 5,000mAh battery in the OnePlus 11 can only be charged at 80W speeds in North America. The OnePlus 13 is more versatile, with 50W wireless charging, 10W reverse wireless charging, and 5W reverse wired charging.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-11-software-and-cameras-2">OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 11: Software and cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oSqYGyywSpnBh2ZFaUQtzK" name="oneplus-11-19.jpg" alt="OnePlus 11 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oSqYGyywSpnBh2ZFaUQtzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One area where the OnePlus 11 has fared quite nicely is in software. Today, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-12-is-now-getting-the-stable-android-15-update" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a>, based on Android 15. It started with Android 13 and was guaranteed four years of OS upgrades, so it should at least get two more Android OS versions. That means it's definitely not time to toss the OnePlus 11 aside — it'll last at least two more years.</p><p>An area that the OnePlus 11 hasn't fared so great is its camera hardware. On paper, the main 50MP doesn't look so bad. However, the OnePlus 13's camera system — with a 50MP, f/1.6 main sensor, a  50MP, f/2.2 ultrawide lens, and a 50 MP, f/2.6 periscope telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom — will blow it out of the water. Additionally, the OnePlus 11's front-facing camera is in the left corner of the display, which is a dated characteristic heading into 2025.</p>

<p>Right now, it doesn't make much sense to buy the OnePlus 11. It's available for the same price as (or more than, in some cases) the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>, which is a newer and better phone overall. But if you have the OnePlus 11, you're probably wondering whether now is a good time to upgrade.</p><p>In this case, two things are true. You can absolutely squeeze a few more years out of the OnePlus 11 if you need to — it's running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, will get full OS upgrades for the next two years, and has decent performance entering 2025. At the same time, the OnePlus 13 is a massive upgrade thanks to its wireless charging tech, Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and overall improved hardware.</p>

<p>Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra is likely right around the corner, and it'll face tough competition from the jump. On the Android side of things, the OnePlus 13 is launching in early January, ahead of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Meanwhile, on the other side of the walled garden, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is already out and used by many people now.</p><p>So, how will one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones </a>compare to the best iPhone? That remains to be seen, but both devices have a lot going for them. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max by the Apple A18 Pro — the two best chipsets in the world. Plus, the phones will have industry-leading cameras and displays.</p><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hasn't been officially announced yet, we're here to give you an early look at how it compares to the iPhone 16 Pro Max based on the latest rumors and leaks.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphones keep getting bigger, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> continued that trend. At 163 x 77.6 x 8.3 mm, it's similar in size to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> but sports a bigger 6.9-inch OLED display. By comparison, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to keep the same 6.8-inch OLED display as its predecessor. The device will measure 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm, according to the latest rumors, making it slightly smaller than the iPhone 16 Pro Max for the first time in a while.</p><p>In terms of materials, the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra should be very similar. Both devices will use a combination of glass and titanium to form a protective chassis certified for IP68 dust and water resistance. Although we're starting to see our first IP69 phones debut, neither Apple nor Samsung's flagships will match that spec.</p><p>Samsung will be slightly changing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s design to make it easier to hold. The strong and boxy rectangular design will be changed to feature slight curves at the corners — that means no more indents in the palm of your hand. It'll still have a flat display, and Samsung appears to have an edge with its Gorilla Armor anti-glare covering. Meanwhile, Apple has Ceramic Shield glass, but it doesn't have anti-reflective properties.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RquzHm7hsoPHEMJFTuALSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The two phones have similar displays, as both are LTPO OLED panels supporting variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. Samsung's panel is expected to have a 1440 x 3120  resolution, while Apple's display has a 2868 x 1320 resolution. If the Galaxy S25 Ultra's predecessor is any indication, its screen should have a higher peak brightness than the 2,000 nits offered by the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Of course, we can't forget about the S Pen, which the Galaxy S25 Ultra will offer for built-in stylus usage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC" name="iphone-16-pro-max-28.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max tinted icons on the home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MTczvNh8hiCrjYLyN3PoaC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the back, the Galaxy S25 Ultra might appear thinner due to its smaller camera housing. The iPhone 16 Pro Max's triple-camera bump is thick and protrudes significantly from the glass back. The iPhone has more hardware customization buttons, with an Action button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">and a new Camera Control button</a>.</p><p>Overall, the two devices are slab-style smartphones, and there's not a ton separating the two. Colors may be another tick in favor of the Galaxy, as the latest leaks suggest we could be getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-all-seven-colorways-tipped">seven colorways for the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>: Titanium Black, Titanium SilverBlue, Titanium Gray, Titanium WhiteSilver, Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold.</p>

<p>This year, it's all about what's on the inside. Both the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have best-in-class processors. Though there was originally debate about whether the Galaxy S25 Ultra would have a Samsung Exynos or Qualcomm Snapdragon chip inside, the rumors have settled on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">entire Galaxy S25 series going Snapdragon-only</a>. That means it'll be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite platform</a>, which brings massive performance improvements over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from last year.</p><p>Early benchmarks for the Snapdragon 8 Elite and the Apple A18 Pro show that the iPhone 16 Pro Max is still about 10% faster in Geekbench 6. However, we don't know how Samsung might optimize or tune the chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Either way, both will be heavily capable for years to come.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and Apple Intelligence software suites are sure to go head-to-head. Samsung has a clear advantage with the Galaxy S25 Ultra since it has been developing AI features for much longer. Plus, certain features — like Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> — benefit from the S Pen. However, some people will prefer the ChatGPT integration on the iPhone to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> integration on the Galaxy.</p><p>In terms of software support, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to receive seven years of full OS upgrades. While Apple devices are known for great software support, the same promise isn't made for the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Samsung phone might end up lasting longer than the iPhone when all is said and done.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7PfgBQF7krCYxZqAhyfug5" name="iphone-16-pro-max-4.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max back view showcasing cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PfgBQF7krCYxZqAhyfug5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max figure to be some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">best camera phones on the market</a>, so how do they compare? Based on the latest rumors, the Galaxy S25 Ultra should have a 200MP, f/1.7 main camera. It'll be paired with a 50MP 5x telephoto lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 50MP ultrawide sensor. Aside from minor sensor upgrades, these figures are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra" target="_blank">similar to those of </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra">the Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>To Apple's credit, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does include hardware upgrades this year. You get a 48MP, f/1.8 main camera, a 48MP, f/2.2 ultrawide camera, and a 12MP, f/2.8 telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. It'll come with 4K 120FPS video recording, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra should feature 8K video recording. However, the iPhone will have the edge in ProRes, Dolby Vision, and Spatial Video formats.</p><p>Of course, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely have an extra telephoto camera that'll help with taking photos at different distances. It also has a higher megapixel count for the main camera, though that probably won't matter much in daily use.</p>

<p>While we'll have to wait for the Galaxy S25 Ultra to launch before we say whether it's better or worse than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, an early picture is clear. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> and a blazing-fast Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the Galaxy S25 Ultra will be as competitive with the latest iPhone as it has ever been. At the same time, iOS 18 and new hardware changes have actually made the iPhone 16 Pro Max the most approachable to Android users as it has ever been.</p><p>Longtime Android fans probably won't be enticed to switch to the iPhone, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra will likely be the best option for them. However, both of these devices figure to be competitive enough to warrant a look by anyone wanting a top-tier smartphone.</p>

You'll see a checklist of some of the prerequisites that are needed in order to enable Identity Check. If you've not done some, like set a screen lock or biometrics, you'll be prompted to complete those steps.</p><p>7. You'll also need to <strong>add a few trusted places</strong> that you frequent.

<h2 id="pixels-now-have-added-security-for-your-sensitive-information-when-you-travel-2">Pixels now have added security for your sensitive information when you travel</h2>
<p>With features like Identity Check, Google is really doubling down on privacy and security for its Pixel devices. You can add any number of trusted places that you frequent to avoid unnecessary authentication steps before you can perform any sensitive actions. Google specifies that Identity Check will only work on devices that support Class 3 biometrics. If you don't see that option under Theft Protection, then your device doesn't support it.</p><p>Google has specified all the sensitive actions that would trigger Identity Check and require additional biometric authentication. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Access saved passwords and passkeys using Google Password Manager.</li><li>Autofill passwords in apps from Google Password Manager (except Chrome).</li><li>Change screen lock, PIN, pattern, and password.</li><li>Change Fingerprint or Face Unlock.</li><li>If you do a Factory reset.</li><li>Turn off Find My Device.</li><li>Turn off any theft protection features.</li><li>View trusted places.</li><li>Set up a new device with your current device.</li><li>Add or remove a Google Account.</li><li>Access Developer options.</li></ul>
<p>This added layer of protection should give you peace of mind if someone tries to access some of your phone's security settings when you're traveling. It's not just new features that are being added with Google's update, though. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-december-2024-security-pixel-update">December security patch for Pixels</a> included several fixes for audio stability and performance in some situations for Pixel 6 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series devices. Other display and camera issues were also addressed with this update.</p>

This also requires you to sign in to Google Messages with your Gmail acccount, which means some of your personal information is visible to whoever you text. If you want to limit who can see this information, here's a quick and easy way to manage your profile in Google Messages.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-manage-your-profile-in-google-messages-2">How to manage your profile in Google Messages</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Google Messages</strong> app.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong> in the upper, right-hand corner.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Your profile</strong> option.</p><p>4. You'll now be on the <strong>Customize how you are seen</strong> page.</p>

<p>5. If you wish to restrict who can see your profile photo, tap the <strong>camera symbol</strong> beside your photo. You can choose between <strong>Anyone </strong>or <strong>People that you interact with</strong>. The latter option includes interacting with others through other Google apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Save</strong> when you're done.</p><p>7. Go back to the main customization page.</p><p>8. Below your photo, you have the option to edit your name if you tap the <strong>Pencil symbol</strong>. Note that this will change your name across other Google services.</p><p>9. The last option, <strong>Show name and picture to, </strong>let's you control who can view your info. You can choose from <strong>People you message</strong>, <strong>Only your contacts</strong>, or <strong>No one</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>The first option in Step 9 will let anyone view your info after you message them, even if they haven't saved your number. The second option will let others see your info only if they've saved your number. The last one will hide your profile info from anyone you message, irrespective of whether they have saved your number or not.</p>

<p>Android users finally get their own version of iMessage thanks to RCS messaging in Google Messages. Think of it as an equivalent to WhatsApp, Telegram, or any other rich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging app</a> that you may use. This allows you to easily share media files like videos and photos, react to messages with emojis, see when the other person is typing or when your message has been read, and so on.</p><p>On supported smartphone devices, you even get GenAI models running on-device in the Messages app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages" target="_blank">Magic Compose,</a> for instance, is a feature using the Gemini Nano AI model that can automatically generate a set of responses based on the context of the chat.</p><p>All RCS chats between two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are end-to-end encrypted, which means all your data stays private. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">iPhone users finally got RCS</a> support with iOS 18, which allows for a similar texting experience between Android and iPhones. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that Android-iPhone RCS chats do not have end-to-end encryption yet, which is a bit of a security concern.</p>

It's a new mode available as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> following the December Pixel Feature drop. In essence, the option will change multiple accessibility settings at once to make your smartphone easier to use.</p><p>Simple View is a new feature, so you might be unsure what exactly it does. Luckily, we've put together this guide with everything you need to know about Simple View, including how to enable and use it.</p>
<h2 id="how-simple-view-works-on-pixel-phones-2">How Simple View works on Pixel phones</h2>
<p>Google added Simple View to Pixels with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">December Feature Drop</a>, and it's available as an accessibility option. The setting is a quick way to change many of your Android phone's accessibility features at the same time. Here's the full list of what Simple View changes on the Pixel Launcher:</p>
<ul><li>Larger text and icon sizes</li><li>Simplified Home screen layout</li><li>Simplified 3-button navigation buttons</li><li>Higher touch sensitivity</li><li>Contact, Clock, and Weather app shortcuts*</li><li>High-contrast wallpaper*</li><li>Increased App Grid to 4x4 display*</li><li>Suggested apps locked*</li></ul>
<p>*Only available when turning on Simple View from Pixel device setup.</p><p>Although Simple View changes many settings at once, it does not prevent you from changing them afterward. You can still make changes to your Pixel's display, layout, navigation, and font settings. Additionally, if you turn off Simple View, your phone's preferences will be reverted to their original ones.</p><p>Notably, the option isn't currently available for the Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or Pixel Tablet.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-on-simple-view-during-pixel-device-setup-2">How to turn on Simple View during Pixel device setup</h2>
<p>To get the full Simple View experience, you'll need to start from scratch by factory resetting your Pixel. The only way to get features like app shortcuts, a 4x4 app grid, a high-contrast wallpaper, and suggested apps locked is to enable Simple View during Pixel device setup.

It represents Google's return to the mixed-reality space after consigning Google Glass to enterprise and discontinuing Google Cardboard and Daydream. Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, assured us that they "never stopped working on" XR despite these public failures and that the "Gemini era" means "the time is right for XR."</p><p>While Google <em>may</em> make Android XR hardware in the future, demos like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra's multimodal AI</a> may remain internal prototypes to focus on Android XR <em>software</em> for other brands — primarily Samsung — making XR devices.</p><p>Android XR may be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">most exciting version of Android in years</a>, but anyone unfamiliar with VR headsets or smart glasses may be confused about what Android XR <em>is</em> and what it's built to do. This guide will run through the basics of what to expect, from Samsung's Project Moohan to Google's XR plans for Gemini.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-android-xr"><span>What is Android XR?</span></h2>
<p>"Android eXtended Reality" is an Android spinoff platform that's designed for wearable devices, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a> in that it's (A) co-designed with Samsung and (B) has to deliver efficient processing in a smaller form factor like glasses.</p><p>XR is a common industry term encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed-reality devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> don't typically fall under this umbrella since they have no reality-changing display, only audio; Google has included it, however, because it'll use the same baseline Gemini assistant as AR glasses.</p><p>Android XR software will underpin the XR headsets and glasses hardware, giving them access to Play Store apps that you won't get on other platforms — mainly Meta's Horizon OS on Quest.</p><p>The platform itself supports certain universal features like hand/controller tracking with external cameras or eye tracking with inward cameras — both enabling the kind of controls you see on the Apple Vision Pro. However, hardware developers will need to make devices that can take advantage of these tools.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-apps-will-run-on-android-xr"><span>What apps will run on Android XR?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> is "at the core" of Android XR, the company says. Whether it's a headset or glasses, it'll use sensors and cameras so that Gemini can "see what you see, whether it's digital or real content, hear what you hear, and react to your gestures alongside your voice."</p><p>With the conversationality of Gemini Live, paired with multimodal AI insights, Android XR will let you use natural voice commands to control the UI or ask contextual questions about what you're seeing, either in real life or in XR apps.</p><p>Outside of Gemini, Google has promised 360º videos on YouTube or Google TV, 3D Google Photos, Google Maps Immersive View, Google Meet, and Chrome with common AI tricks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

<p>Beyond Google apps, Android XR is compatible with both WebXR and OpenXR, the most common standards for web-based and native XR apps across the industry. That should mean many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a> should port over to compatible Android XR headsets.</p><p>The Android XR SDK also supports Android Studio, ARCore, Jetpack Compose, and Unity. Any current Android apps will "just work" on Android XR (according to Google) as long as the developer opts in, though this will probably be a floating window in the "infinite desktop" virtual space; developers will want to optimize the app to the OS for any 3D visual effects. A few devs have already developed apps for Android XR with early access, including MLB, Calm, and Adobe.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/unlock-the-infinite-possibilities-of-xr-with-galaxy-ai">revealed</a> its XR headset, Project Moohan, at the same time as Google's Android XR; Moohan means "Infinity" in Korean, matching the theme. Samsung promises "state-of-the-art displays, Passthrough capabilities, and natural multi-modal input" but hasn't specified what specs it'll have when it launches to consumers in 2025.</p><p>We do know it'll use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a>, the chipset announced in January 2024 that supports up to 4.3K per eye, plus a 20% CPU boost and 15% GPU boost over the XR2 Gen 2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. However, it's not guaranteed that Moohan will hit that resolution.</p><p>Based on the render above — plus private demos given to a few outlets — we know Samsung's XR headset will have a comfortable Elite-style strap, as well as a removable light shield for better immersion during VR experiences but less isolation during mixed-reality apps. It'll have outer IR cameras for tracking hands or controllers, plus inward cameras for eye tracking.</p><p>While Samsung has its own apps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> built off of Gemini, we believe Android XR (and Moohan) will default to Google apps and multimodal Gemini AI for commands and navigation, based on what we heard from Samsung.</p>

<p>Other Android XR hardware developers will likely choose the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 as well, given that Google partnered with Qualcomm and optimized the platform for its silicon. Google has confirmed that Xreal, Sony, and Lynx will develop Android XR devices.</p><p>At CES 2024, Sony <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">announced an XR headset</a> with the XR2+ Gen 2, 4K OLED micro-displays with pancake lenses that you can flip up like a visor, and 3D productivity software. It's the most likely candidate for Sony's Android XR device.</p><p>Xreal recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">spatial AR glasses</a> with up to 57-degree FoV and an add-on Xreal Eye Camera for capturing 1080p video and sending data to your phone for "multimodal AI." We don't think these glasses will support Android XR, but that camera sounds like the precursor to a newer version with Google software and Gemini built-in, with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> powering things.</p><p>Lynx, whose current XR headset has dealt with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-production-an-absolute-mess/">delays and controversy</a>, will develop a new Android XR headset rather than update the R1, based on a statement made to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/sony-lynx-xreal-android-xr-devices/">UploadVR</a>.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-google-make-an-android-xr-device"><span>Will Google make an Android XR device?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD" name="Google-IO-2024-AR-glasses.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oYWDsk5xBW4xwuPcfYAHfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A glimpse of Google's multimodal AI demo (and smart glasses) at Google I/O 2024 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is taking a backseat to Samsung in terms of releasing an actual Android XR device, focusing on software. At least for now!</p><p>In 2023, The Information reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-ar-glasses-problems-behind-scenes">Google's XR prototypes</a>, including Project Moohan, a monocular Google Glass-lookalike codenamed "Betty," a two-display spin-off called "Barry," and an unnamed pair of smart glasses from former Magic Leap CTO Paul Greco and his team.</p><p>It's very possible that these devices are nothing more than prototypes developed to test Android XR, rather than anything planned for wide release. But Google did show off its own Android XR smart glasses demo to sites like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">The Verge</a> with multimodal AI capabilities, and it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">showed a glimpse of these glasses at I/O 2024</a> (see the screenshot above).</p><p>It's <em>possible</em> that Google could join in on the Android XR fun, but it evidently wants to try and let its partners establish themselves first before cutting in on the action. It's similar to how Google co-developed the new version of Wear OS with Samsung in 2021 but didn't release its first Pixel Watch until late 2022.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os"><span>Android XR vs. Meta Horizon OS</span></h2>

<p>The biggest rival to Android XR will be Meta Horizon OS, the system behind Quest headsets. Meta is the most established brand in the XR space, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-play-store-not-on-meta-quest-headsets">tried to get Google to give Quest headsets Play Store access</a>, only for Google to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-meta">insist that Meta use Android XR</a>, which Meta rebuffed.</p><p>Meta itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">made Meta Horizon OS open to partners</a> in 2024, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make XR headsets with Meta software and apps. Meta and Xbox also plan to coordinate on a limited-edition headset.</p><p>Meta has a full library of games it can share with partners, as well as Meta AI. What it doesn't have is access to a Play Store full of apps and a development pipeline designed to convert phone apps into Android XR apps, like Google has; it has to use progressive web apps, and it's had very few productivity partners thus far.</p><p>Both platforms use Snapdragon chipsets, hand tracking, and UIs that float windows in virtual or mixed-reality space. Meta has its own popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>, and the promise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> in 2027, and they both use a similar interface to the Quest.</p><p>All of this is to say, Meta Horizon and Android XR have similar goals, methods, and devices. It's far too soon to say if Android XR will be better, worse, or a clone of Meta Horizon. What matters most is that Meta and Google will challenge one another, which ideally will lead to greater innovation in the XR space.</p>

Head to Walmart now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Tune-Beam-Headphones-in-Ear-Earbuds/1597454551"><strong>you can score a whopping $60.95 off the JBL Tune Beam</strong></a>, knocking the price of the already-affordable earbuds down to a mere $39. </p>

<p>Currently just shy of $40 during Walmart's Christmas sale, the Tune Beam earbuds from JBL give you some decent noise cancellation, a well-rounded sound profile with 6mm drivers and plenty of bass (customizable in the companion app), and a shockingly good 48 hours of max battery life. I'm also a fan of those little battery alert lights built into the charging case. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Tune-Beam-Headphones-in-Ear-Earbuds/1597454551" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1f0ee58a-9e21-4a96-a569-0815f53fb1f2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="JBL Tune Beam earbuds: $99.95" data-dimension48="JBL Tune Beam earbuds: $99.95">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a cheap pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that won&apos;t skimp on premium features like active noise cancellation (ANC); battery life is important to you. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need the best sound quality and can afford to spend a little more (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C345M3T7"><strong>might I suggest the Sony WF-1000XM5, if so?</strong></a>); you need features like spatial audio support and adaptive ANC. </p><p>The JBL Tune Beam won&apos;t win any awards for innovation, but you&apos;re still getting iconic JBL sound with noise cancellation, up to 48 hours of battery life, and IP54 water/dust resistance straight out of the box. All of this for 40 bucks? Yeah, it&apos;s that good. The box even comes with some replacement bud covers so you can find the size that works best for you. </p><p>Sure, you&apos;ll be missing out on some fancy features like spatial audio support and hands-free calling, but again, they&apos;re 40 bucks. Audiophiles should probably look elsewhere, but if you need a pair of simple, sturdy earbuds to take on your morning jogs, then this deal is unmissable.</p>

Yes, 2024 was fun for those of us journalists covering consumer audio technology, and I hope that the work we’ve done has helped you have just as much fun — whether you’ve purchased any audio gear in 2024 based on something you’ve read here, or you’re just an enthusiast who enjoys reading about it.</p><p>In case you didn’t buy anything in 2024 and are looking to 2025 to be the year that you up your audio game, I’m going to explore where we’ve been in 2024 and how that has shaped what I want to see and, hopefully, what you’ll be able to buy in 2025. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-do-this-in-2025-2">Manufacturers! Do this in 2025…</h2>
<p>I’m a simple man. I can be easily entertained, so maybe this seems like it isn’t the grand, showy feature you were expecting but my favorite feature in 2024 that should be in every pair of earbuds in 2025 and beyond is offline voice control.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have the ability to control some basic but frequently used features of the earbuds with your voice <em>without having to use a wake word.</em> It’s just very natural and worked flawlessly for me when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review" target="_blank">I reviewed the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.</a> It’s basic, but for those of us out on a hike, working out in the gym, or cooking, this feature is priceless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-hero-closeup.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro on a desk with the lid open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4atpUko5ZahdGFqABcWrSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a Star Trek nerd, the next feature I want to see in every premium pair of earbuds in 2025 comes from Samsung again, and that’s the Galaxy AI-driven live translation through the earbuds during phone calls. This feature allows you to speak to someone in English, for example, Galaxy AI will process that in the cloud, and then an AI voice will speak your words to them in their native language. This works bi-directionally.</p><p>There are purpose-built earbuds already on the market that specifically do live translations, similar to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and of course, you can already use Google Translate through other earbuds, including the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which isn't as seamless an experience. Still, the technology is there for Samsung's version of live translation of phone calls to be ubiquitous across pairs of major manufacturer buds at a certain price point.</p><p>Engage!</p>
<h2 id="sky-s-the-limit-2">Sky’s the limit!</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Jixq34LZe6UvsLmpj74t7m" name="sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-AI-hero.jpg" alt="Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 in the cloud city" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jixq34LZe6UvsLmpj74t7m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With those two very practical favorites of mine out of the way, let’s talk open skies, big ideas, and technology that could make things better for those who need assistive technology.</p><p>Different manufacturers have their own flavor of audio sharing, and none of them work cross-platform. If you’re an Apple fan and want to watch a movie with a friend on a train, for example, you’ll need Apple or Beats earbuds, and they both need to support the <em>Share Audio</em> feature. Not all do—the same thing with Android. You’ll need compatible phones or earbuds for a feature like Samsung’s <em>Dual Audio</em>.</p><p>In 2020, Auracast was announced as a feature of the newer Bluetooth LE Audio standard, but it hasn’t yet seen wide adoption. We’ve written an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio" target="_blank">FAQ about Bluetooth LE</a> and even went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">hands-on with Auracast at IFA 2024</a>.</p><p>The nuts and bolts of it are that it is a technology that works similarly to traditional radio towers, but instead of broadcasting a signal to your car stereo’s FM radio, a single smartphone can send out a stream that multiple people’s Bluetooth earbuds or headphones can all listen in on.</p><p>Most importantly, this technology has a lot of interest in the hearing-impaired community as it could be baked right into hearing aids, overcoming some of those devices' limitations in receiving public address audio. And it wouldn't just be smartphones broadcasting, but TVs in gyms, airport gates, the refs and commentators at live football games, and more.</p>

<p>In 2025, we may see much broader support for Auracast now that Google has baked it into the <em>Connected Devices</em> menu in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview</a>. Of all the audio technology I’m waiting on, this one is positioned to be the most profoundly impactful.</p><p>Everyone, from the hearing impaired to sports fans to those using public transportation, will benefit significantly from ubiquitous Auracast broadcast support in our smartphones and sound devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">And with excellent earbuds</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-review" target="_blank">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</a> and the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 supporting Auracast</a>, this needs to happen post-haste.</p>
<h2 id="better-audio-for-all-2">Better audio for all</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wTErHkLtXmkHrW8pHywNwC" name="MTW4 audio codec displayed.png" alt="aptX codec on a Pixel 7 Pro, connected to a pair of Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTErHkLtXmkHrW8pHywNwC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While we're on the subject of Bluetooth codecs and technology, let's also address Hi-Res Audio.</p><p>High resolution is so much more immersive than the streaming files you’ll get from something like Spotify’s standard streams, so I’ve been watching eagerly as more wallet-friendly earbud and headphone options have emerged that support LDAC, LHDC, and aptX Lossless.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB" name="spotify-wallpaper-fe0b.png" alt="Earbuds restiing on phone display, above the Spotify logo" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GS255FgwUqmuX4KUvzEzbB.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div></figure>
<p>As much as I love Tidal’s Max FLAC files and Apple’s ALAC files, the thing that will take public love of these highly engaging Bluetooth codecs to the next level is Spotify following through on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/years-later-spotify-still-says-its-working-on-super-premium-with-lossless-audio">what it’s been telling us for years</a> at this point and delivering their Hi-Fi streaming option.</p><p>I wouldn’t wait for it at this point, but if I’m being completely honest, like Shakira’s hips, the numbers don’t lie. Spotify has over 30% of the global market share, with its closest competitor being Tencent Music out of China, with only 14%, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/653926/music-streaming-service-subscriber-share/"><u>Statista</u></a>. According to the site, Spotify has 252 million premium subscribers as of the third quarter of 2024, with 640 million total active monthly users globally.</p><p>The best part about making this happen in 2025 is that great earbuds like the Nothing Ear, EarFun Air Pro 4, and Liberty Pro 4 offer great hardware and sonic experiences with hi-res wireless Bluetooth codec support at prices non-audiophiles can afford.</p>

<p>Frankly, 2024 was phenomenal for us fitness enthusiasts who love the outdoors and want to push our limits to the beat of our favorite tunes. Open-ear audio took a huge leap forward with notable launches in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing’s Ear Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review" target="_blank">Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds.</a></p><p>The advance is bigger than that, though, with XR in the mix. Bluetooth earbuds are no good with XR platforms due to latency, so you need a dongle or USB-C headphones/earbuds to get synced audio. Some platforms like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> have open-ear speakers built into the frames, as do some newer AI glasses platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, and they’re pretty good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-transparent-01" alt="Taking the transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses out of its charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2py6YMqJLAjZDsYEjAKEX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing proved you can create open-ear earbuds with great bass response, and Ray-Ban did a solid job building immersive sound into the frames of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again" target="_blank">Meta smart glasses</a>, so in 2025, I think we’ll see a greater proliferation of open-ear audio in XR applications, smart glasses, and as standalone wearables, but we won’t be saying, “these sound great… for open-ear.”</p>

<h2 id="the-generative-generation-2">The “Generative Generation”</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo" name="audible-app-pixel-buds-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Audible App Pixel Buds Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EbAZhSRPM7TnUqmNtLjZQo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, with generative AI growing exponentially, we’ll see it a lot more in 2025. It’ll provide voiceover reads on websites if you want an article read to you (it’s already doing this), and it will be used by those in the audiobook industry to provide narration. But will it give me the emotion and uniqueness I get from human voice actors from various walks of life and backgrounds?</p><p>Is this the record vs CD debate all over again? The analog human voice with its warmth and texture vs the digitally generated voice? Time will tell, and I’ll be hesitant to embrace it, but I don’t think most people care too much and may not even notice the difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of “generative AI,” we’ll see further integrations of the new wave of AI agents powered by ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini and Gemini Nano on mobile. Having reviewed Nothing and Google earbuds, which support both natively, in 2025, they’ll need to be more functional.</p><p>Right now, you can ask them questions, and you can have a really cool back-and-forth with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones" target="_blank">Gemini Live,</a> but it’s missing much of the functionality that Google Assistant has on mobile. I can have a running conversation with Gemini Live, asking it to point me to the best chili fries when I’m visiting Houston, TX, but when I’ve decided upon one of its recommendations, it won’t automatically launch Google Maps and take me to that establishment.</p>

We’ll turn everything into a subscription, including oxygen. Wanna breathe? Pay up!</em></p><p>Ok, that was a bit of hyperbole, but not that far off. Android Automotive OS is one of the main things I’m <em>not</em> looking forward to in 2025. Tesla and Rivian have already eschewed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and CarPlay connectivity, but the 2024 Chevy Blazer EV was GM's foray into telling the public they’re going another route as well, and they’d better get ready to pay up <em>after</em> the initial car purchase. That may mean that in addition to paying for your Tidal, Apple Music, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> subs, you’ll have to pay for a GM Android Automotive OS subscription to access your other subscriptions in the car.</p><p>The Blazer was just the beginning because that change is coming to all of GM's EVs.</p><p>GM integrated Android Automotive into the Blazer EV for “more advanced features,” but what it really wants is what it projects to be around $25 billion of additional revenue annually by 2030, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/what-carmakers-don-t-want-you-to-know-about-the-future-of-android-auto-and-carplay-243884.html" target="_blank">other car makers are taking notice, according to autoevolution.com.</a></p><p>What do you think about that? Would you pay to subscribe to an automotive OS so that you can have access to other things you already subscribe to built into your car without the need for a phone?</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What  you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android Auto rolls out fixes to earlier reported issues like Wi-Fi error messages and stuttering audio issues.</li><li>The rollout has begun over the past couple of weeks, and it is advisable for users to stay on the latest Android Auto v13.3.</li><li>The company is also working on current Android Auto issues reported from the latest Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL models.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto, in a recent community post, shared several new updates that it released this month, which will fix notable bugs that users have reported over the past few weeks.</p><p>The bugs include stuttering audio and Wi-Fi error messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-auto-update-addresses-wi-fi-bug-and-stuttering-audio/?taid=67662130068c530001b0bbb7&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">Android Police</a>). The company is also highlighting other bugs that it is working on, including those appearing for owners of devices like the latest Pixel 9 Pro. All sets of fixes and current bugs are shared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/97890637/android-auto-known-issues-updated-12-20-2024?hl=en-GB&sjid=7304505883262554186-AP">Android Auto community site</a>.</p>
<p>One of the notable fixes, per the community post, is an error message stating that the phone does not support 5GHz Wi-Fi connections. The support team has evidently fixed this and encourages users facing the issue to update to the latest Android Auto v13.3 version.</p><p>Similarly, some users had reported wireless audio stuttering (while playing music or maps) when connected to Android Auto, and the latest version of the app has also addressed this issue.</p><p>While these are some of the notable fixes the company has rolled out over the past couple of weeks, the support team has further acknowledged some of the known issues reported by users this month, which the team is believed to be working on.</p>
<p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> owner reported no audio being played through a music streaming service via Android Auto since installing the December 2024 Android 15 feature drop on their device. Owners of other Pixel devices have also chimed in with the same problems.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> users have been facing an Android Auto issue during calls, wherein the user is able to make and receive calls but is unable to hear audio. Lastly, some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> and 14T users who updated to Android 15-based Hyper OS 2.0 also reported issues about Android Auto not working properly after the update.</p>

<p>The Android Auto support team notes that these new bugs are currently on the verge of getting fixed, amongst others, and users can expect the fix to roll out in the coming weeks or months.</p><p>Aside from the aforementioned bugs, Android Auto is also working on bringing radio station features to the platform. Evidence relating to the feature has been seen in several instances over the past few months. Most recently, the latest beta version of the app was seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-latest-beta-teases-radio-station-feature-again">showcasing categories/music genres</a> of radio stations hidden under the app’s backend.</p>

It's this familiarity combined with an obsessive focus on design that made using OnePlus phones enjoyable over the years. <br><br>After a decade, OnePlus is overhauling its design ethos with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/three-reasons-you-should-wait-for-the-oneplus-13-and-two-reasons-not-to">OnePlus 13</a>. Similar to most phones available today, the OnePlus 13 switches a boxier design, eschewing the flowing elegance of previous models. That said, the device comes with a vegan leather back (if you're getting the Midnight Ocean variant), and it looks highly interesting.<br><br>Ahead of the global launch, I talked to Ryan Ruan, head of OnePlus's Industrial Design Center, to get a better sense of the OnePlus 13's design and battery tech, and what the manufacturer is doing differently this time. The obvious starting point was the move to flat sides, and why OnePlus decided to alter the design. Ruan noted that OnePlus's design team "worked hard to make OnePlus 13 feel better in your hand than any other phone," investing a "significant amount of time in refining the transition between the front and back glass and the straight-edged frame" to deliver better durability and a device that still looks elegant. <br><br>Because OnePlus phones had dual-curved edges in the past, there was an increased chance of damage to the front or rear panes of glass if the device took a tumble and landed on an edge. Ruan said this was a point of contention with its users, and that OnePlus has been "continuously discussing and validating how to ensure a smooth overall curvature connection without compromising the device's drop resistance."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6o9zsFnrRY4rZ7bAewb855.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the OnePlus 13, Ruan said the goal was "for the transition surfaces to better conform to the natural curve of the user's palm while also providing a secure grip; to this end, we invested in the refinement and validation of nearly a hundred models" before settling on the final design for the OnePlus 13. <br><br>On the subject of durability, OnePlus says it decided to use a Microfiber Vegan Leather back to allow OnePlus 13 customers to use the device without a case. The vegan leather back is highly intriguing, as it uses a softer texture that hasn't been seen before on any phone. "We've fine-tuned the material composition and surface treatment to create an even more luxurious and durable texture that's also environmentally friendly," said Ruan. <br><br>"It's designed to offer a natural leather-like grip without compromising on style or sustainability. A lot of other leather-backed phones normally sacrifice the in-hand comfort just to guarantee daily durability. In the end, the leather may feel sort of plasticky (with a very rough texture). However, on the OnePlus 13, the microfiber vegan leather material is something we worked on for over a year; it guarantees good durability, and more importantly feels soft in your hand."<br><br>Ruan also stated that even though the Midnight Ocean model has a leather back, it doesn't interfere with wireless charging to any noticeable degree. "The thinness of the vegan leather back enables good proximity to the wireless charging coil, enhancing the charging efficiency. Meanwhile, the high-temperature resistance ensures that the phone can handle the slight increase in heat that can occur during wireless charging without any adverse effects."<br><br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:38.77%;"><img id="4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FtPnBYygaNmLQwSTZLt25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 has a flat AMOLED panel this time, but it includes 2.5D quad-curved edges with a "micro-curve ratio" that Ruan says will make a difference while using the device — at the same time negating accidental touches. Ruan said the micro-curve transition between the flat middle frame and the quad-curve glass ensures users don&apos;t get a sharp in-hand feeling, and guarantees a solid grip. "We chose to create a 2.8D screen which is designed to offer the visual appeal of a flat screen while also giving our users the smooth touch experience they get from a 3D screen."</p><p>Continuing with the in-hand feel, Ruan revealed that the OnePlus 13 has a 50:50 weight distribution, so even though it has a sizeable camera module, it isn&apos;t unwieldy to hold or use. "If you place your finger right under the OnePlus logo and support the phone, you&apos;ll find the phone doesn&apos;t lean towards one way or the other. That&apos;s because we introduce an evenly-split weight distribution. It requires our engineers to figure out a way to allocate more components in the lower half of the phone to balance the weight."<br>
<br>
Another interesting tidbit is that OnePlus is eschewing Coring&apos;s Gorilla Glass in favor of a custom Ceramic Guard solution on the OnePlus 13, with Ruan stating that it delivers "superior drop protection and scratch resistance. It&apos;s reinforced with nano crystalline, a material that significantly enhances its fracture toughness. The result is that the OnePlus 13 display is twice as resistant to drops compared to conventional cover glass."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXETuNXqQFPi2Nec3Rb75.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, the OnePlus 13 gets IP68 and IP69 resistance, with the latter designed to withstand high-pressure jets of water at up to 80 degrees Celsius. Interestingly, IP69 doesn't cover immersion in water, so manufacturers need to also have their devices tested for IP68 as well — that's why you see most 2025 phones having both IP68 and IP69. <br><br>One of the most exciting changes coming to 2025 phones is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a>, with most Chinese manufacturers using a silicon-carbon anode in their batteries to increase density and durability. The OnePlus 13 also has this tech, and the 6000mAh battery is dubbed OnePlus Silicon NanoStack. <br></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5" name="OnePlus 13 render" alt="OnePlus 13 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwJEYxh2Hae8tqeuD44MB5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting is that OnePlus is using a dual-cell configuration with the battery. Honor, OPPO, and Vivo use a single-cell battery on their devices, and by using two cells on the OnePlus 13, you get the best of both worlds — increased density, and fast 100W charging speeds. <br><br>Notably, the OnePlus 13 is using a 10% silicon-carbon anode, leading to an energy density of 805Wh/L, a heady 5.5% increase over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a>. That's why OnePlus is able to fit a bigger 6000mAh battery in the OnePlus 13 while still delivering a phone that's 10g lighter and 0.7mm thinner. <br><br>Ruan said the goal with the OnePlus 13 was to create a device with the best in-hand feel of any OnePlus phone to date, while ensuring it has better durability. Having used other devices that made a similar design transition — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — in recent weeks, I'm excited to take a look at the OnePlus 13 and see if the manufacturer's claims actually hold up. I'll have much more to share about the OnePlus 13 as we head closer to the January 7 launch day, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>With just a few days to go until 2025, it's hard not to wonder what the future holds in store for accessories.</p><p>In the past, some of the most notable changes in the world of smartphone accessories have always been associated with the capabilities and characteristics of phones themselves. Revolutions in smartphones come and go, with record-breaking charging speeds and industry-shattering performance benchmarks met each year, and companion accessories come into play with these changes.</p><p>When it comes to accessories in 2025, I feel two main factors will reshape the landscape of the market: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tags/qi2">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Bluetooth Auracast</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2025-could-be-the-year-of-qi2-2">2025 could be the year of Qi2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW" name="samsung-qi2-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="Mock Qi2 MagSafe ring on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUH6XoCW9usk5gsTBgQZAW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3716" height="2090" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, I've been harping on about Qi2 for a while. I honestly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-samsung-galaxy-s24-series">thought the Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> and the Google Pixel 9 lineup would be the first to take this leap. Of course, that did not happen. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> turned out to be the first phone in the world to adopt the standard. There are no other Qi2-integrated Android phones at the moment; however, I haven't given up on Qi2 yet.</p><p>According to prominent tipster Ice Universe, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Samsung Galaxy S25 series will finally come with Qi2</a> wireless charging. As we discovered during our testing with the S24 Ultra, MagSafe cases and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">magnetic accessories interfere with S Pen functionality</a>, so if this S25 rumor is true, it would require a massive undertaking on Samsung's part. The brand would need to reengineer the device's internals to fix this.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">rumor from Suomimobiili</a>, a Finnish tech news website, alleges that the S25 series will adopt the Qi2 standard but in an unexpected way. Apparently, Samsung will offer MagSafe cases for the Galaxy S25 lineup. This could mean two things: either Samsung will bring Qi2 to the S25 series, or it hopes that a magnetic phone cover can bridge that gap and bring magnetic wireless charging to its phones without native Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As the world's top seller of smartphones, Samsung has the resources to make this a reality. If anyone can bring about the wider adoption of a new standard, it would definitely be Samsung — or Google. And now that hundreds, if not thousands, of Qi2 accessories, are so widely available, it only makes sense to launch a Qi2 phone now.</p>
<h2 id="auracast-is-going-to-redefine-bluetooth-for-the-better-2">Auracast is going to redefine Bluetooth for the better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3838px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKfNqooATWhxiWkQiTFH7a" name="Auracast-experience-sennheiser-app-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="Auracast on the Sennheiser app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKfNqooATWhxiWkQiTFH7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3838" height="2159" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Qi2, Bluetooth Auracast isn't a new standard. The feature enables users to transmit audio playback to multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously. There are so many incredible ways this audio broadcast system can be utilized. Think Spotify Jam but local, without the need to use a specific app or have any sort of subscription or internet connection. Our managing editor, Derrek Lee, tested it at IFA 2024 and described it as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024" target="_blank">Bluetooth's final form</a>" because it was that impressive.</p><p>The perfect example of how Auracast can be so useful would be at an airport or a public space. If you're listening to a podcast or streaming some music, you might miss important announcements. But with Bluetooth Auracast broadcasts, these announcements could be made directly to your earbuds.</p><p>I can think of so many other scenarios where this could be a lifesaver. Imagine being on a road trip with friends, but you're all in a bus, train, or maybe even a plane. You could all jam along to the same songs without disturbing other passengers via Auracast. It'd be like a private jam session or concert that no one else can hear.</p><p>Although it has been two and a half years since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/audio/bluetooth-auracast-broadcast-audio-announcement">Bluetooth SIG announced Auracast</a>, a public launch is still pending. I am confident that we will see the first Auracast phones in 2025. As with Qi2, there are tons of Auracast-ready audio accessories available now. Big-name brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-iii-review" target="_blank">Marshall have started adding Bluetooth Auracast</a> support to their new releases, and even smaller brands like EarFun are joining in.</p>
<hr>
<p>With both Qi2 and Bluetooth Auracast looming on the horizon, 2025 is going to be a very interesting year. One thing's for sure: accessory makers are going to continue to make more and more products that support both features. Let's see whether my predictions about the widespread adoption of both Qi2 and Auracast come to pass.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Meta is rumored to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and Meta AI responses, expected in late 2025.</li><li>The current model lacks a visual display, relying on audio and phone integration, but the new version will include a built-in screen.</li><li>The new glasses will feature a small screen for notifications and responses, but won’t be a full mixed-reality device—Meta’s Orion AR glasses are aiming for that in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is reportedly preparing to launch an updated version of its Ray-Ban AR glasses with a display that’ll show notifications and replies from Meta AI.</p><p>According to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/77bd9117-0a2d-4bd7-9248-4dd288f695a4" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, Meta's new version of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> is expected to drop in the second half of 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/23/meta-ray-ban-display-smart-glasses-2025-report/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The current Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have a major downside: no visual feedback. Users can get audio responses from the digital assistant and view extra info on their phone, but the lack of a screen limits the overall experience. On the other hand, the upcoming third-gen model is expected to change that with a built-in display.</p><p>This move is right in line with Meta's grand plan to create lightweight, easy-to-wear devices that could eventually replace smartphones for everyday computing. The goal is a future where users can effortlessly access info, get things done faster, and interact with virtual assistants in a seamless, immersive way.</p><p>Sources close to Meta's plans say the new Ray-Ban smart glasses will feature a small screen mainly used for showing notifications and responses.</p><p>It’s pretty clear Meta isn’t aiming to make the new Ray-Ban smart glasses a full-on mixed-reality device. Toward that goal, the company is working on the Orion AR glasses, a slick prototype that’s still a few years away from being available to the public.</p><p>We’re not sure how adding a display in the line of sight will affect the design, but the current setup has its charm. It lets users capture photos and videos effortlessly, share them straight to Meta platforms, and enjoy audio through the built-in speakers.</p><p>Meta is focused on cementing its lead in the growing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses market</a>. With heavyweights like Apple and Google eyeing their own entry into the space, the competition is heating up. According to FT, Meta sees this new platform as the next big leap in tech, one that could eventually replace smartphones as the main way we interact with technology.</p><p>The Ray-Ban smart glasses have earned a lot of praise, and it’s no surprise. They look great, and with features like in-ear speakers, sharp cameras, and quick access to Meta’s virtual assistant, they deliver.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Drive just rolled out a handy new feature that allows for instant video playback right after uploading on the web, so you can finally get rid of those frustrating wait times.</p><p>In a recent Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/release-notes-12-20-2024.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google announced that instant video playback on the web is now live. The company didn’t dive into the technical details, but it’s clear the changes work like a charm.</p><p>Before this update, uploading videos to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-drive-tips-and-tricks">Google Drive</a> meant waiting for them to go through a transcoding process. Basically, the videos had to be converted into a streaming-friendly format for Drive’s player. This step often took forever, leaving creators stuck waiting instead of diving right in.</p><p>From now on, you can start watching videos as soon as they’re done uploading to Google Drive.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">Cloud storage services</a> like Google Drive are built on a simple idea—upload files and get them back when you need them. But with the competition heating up, these services have evolved beyond the basics. Now, they come packed with nifty features like advanced sharing options.</p><p>Back in October, Google Drive rolled out an updated media player with auto-transcriptions and faster video loading. Now, with the new tweaks, the service is cutting down video loading delays even further.</p><p>Even with this improvement, it's not perfect yet. Users still have to wait for the video processing to finish before they can share their videos with others through Drive’s player.</p><p>Google has confirmed that this upgrade is available to a wide range of users, including all Google Workspace customers, individual Workspace subscribers, and personal Google account users.</p><p>Right now, the feature is available to users in the Rapid Release domains. But starting January 2, 2025, it’ll be rolled out to everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The OnePlus Open 2's launch keeps getting pushed back, with a late 2025 release now looking likely.</li><li>Initially, the delay was thought to be for Qualcomm’s latest chipset, but now it seems like unexpected development issues are causing the holdup.</li><li>The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to come with major upgrades, including a better rear camera, hardware, and a bigger battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> feels endless, and now it seems the launch might be pushed back even further, which is a bummer for anyone itching to see the next-gen foldable from OnePlus.</p><p>Tipster Sanju Choudhary claims on X that the OnePlus Open 2 might not hit store shelves until late 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_open_2_may_arrive_later_than_previously_rumored-news-65827.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Details are scarce, but it looks like fans of OnePlus’ foldables are in for a long wait.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The OnePlus OPEN 2 is 🔥 ....H2 2025..<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1870094317374640134">December 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Earlier reports suggested that the Open 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-may-have-a-launch-window-lined-up-for-its-next-foldable-phone">could debut as early as Q1 2025</a>, but that’s still far off from earlier speculations. At this point, a 2024 launch seems pretty much off the table.</p><p>At first, it seemed like the Open 2 was delayed to pack in Qualcomm’s latest chipset. But this new setback hints at unexpected development issues slowing things down even more.</p><p>These rumors are still up in the air until OnePlus makes it official. While the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> launched in October 2023, that doesn’t give us much to go on for its sequel. OnePlus’ release schedules can shift due to all kinds of factors, making past launches a shaky guide for what’s next.</p><p>The next OnePlus foldable is rumored to bring big upgrades to its rear camera and hardware, making the wait totally worth it.</p><p>Previous rumors suggested the Open 2 could be the first foldable in the U.S. to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, that is, if it drops in early 2025.</p><p>Reports also say the OnePlus Open 2 will pack an impressive battery, outdoing any foldable before it. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">expect a thinner design and better durability</a>, with the device being thinner and more water-resistant than the last one. These upgrades are definitely cranking up the hype.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oppo is expected to reveal the Find N5 next year, likely with the same hardware as the OnePlus Open 2. Given the parallel launch of the Find N3 and the original OnePlus Open last year, we could see both foldables debut around the same time in the next 12 months.</p>

<ul><li>Google has reportedly delivered its proposal to the DOJ's suggestion for it to sell off Chrome due to anti-competitive practices.</li><li>Seeing the DOJ's proposal as "extreme," Google suggests a better remedy would be to let other companies make "multiple" deals and choices available for users.</li><li>This all started after a landmark ruling claimed Google was an illegal search monopoly in July, thus provoking the DOJ's hand in forcing the selling of Chrome, Android, and more.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. has continued to probe into Google's dominance with Chrome and a recent development sees the company rebuttal.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is looking into Google's alleged anticompetitive practices with Chrome, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2024.12.20_1108_Executive_Summary_of_Google_Proposed_Final_Judgment.pdf">a recent filing</a> expresses the company's disagreement with the government's proposal, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-21/google-blasts-chrome-sale-as-extreme-remedy-at-odds-with-law?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-remedies-proposal-dec-2024/">stated that any sort of "remedy"</a> to the situation should involve letting other browsers have the freedom to "do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users." Additionally, Mulholland expressed Google's second browser agreement solution, which involves allowing the competition to leverage Search for both the user and their revenue.</p><p>Google states it seeks "flexibility" rather than the DOJ's proposal. As such, the company says its solution would allow for "multiple default agreements across different platforms." As an example, Google states Apple could provide a different search engine <em>and </em>browser on its iPhones and iPads. What's more, companies could swap their "default" every 12 months.</p><p>The solutions put forth by Google in its recent filing regard the DOJ's "extreme remedies." Of course, the company is referring to the U.S. government's suggestion for Google to sell Chrome. An excerpt from Google's document states, "...courts must take care to avoid decrees that “could wind up impairing rather than enhancing competition."</p><p>It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">reported in mid-November</a> that the Department of Justice and the presiding judge, Amit Mehta, have sought to force Google to sell Chrome for anti-competitive practices. This follows the government's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">landmark ruling</a> that the company broke Section 2 of the Sherman Act, turning it into an illegal search monopoly.</p><p>It's because of this that the DOJ is pushing Google to sell significant parts of its business — and Chrome, alongside Android, is wrapped in it. Regarding Chrome, government lawyers claim Google has "boxed out" the competition and has stifled rival incentives.</p><p>As Bloomberg notes, a final decision isn't on the table until August 2025 at the latest. However, if Google does have to sell Chrome, the internet will remain, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">but the players will change</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-things-to-note-about-adding-your-passport-to-google-wallet-2">A few things to note about adding your passport to Google Wallet</h2>
<p>As noted, you will still need to bring your physical passport for travel since an ID pass is not a government-issued ID nor a replacement for your physical one. ID passes do not support international travel, but they should work with TSA security for domestic travel within the U.S. at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/digital-id/map" target="_blank">selected supported airports</a>.</p><p>Which airports does this include? See the list linked above, but note that this includes select locations within each state, such as the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the Los Angeles International Airport in California, both John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and others.</p><p>The feature is also only available in the U.S. for now, but it’s possible we may see it expanded to other countries passports and locations in the future.</p><p>Users are required to have an Android phone with OS 9.0 or higher and must have Bluetooth and Nearby devices on in order for it to work. It’s crucial that you set a screen lock in order to use this feature as well, which is an added security measure.</p><p>You can’t link your passport to an existing ID pass on Google Wallet. You will need to create a new one. But once you do, you’ll love the convenience of having an ID that’s accepted in certain places to confirm your age and country of residence. The best part is that virtually all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> support Google Wallet.</p><p>Finally, if you decide you no longer want to have a digital version of your passport in Google Wallet, select your ID pass in Google Wallet, select More (the three vertical dots), and select Remove and Remove again. You can also do this remotely at <strong>myaccount.google.com</strong>. Go to your Personal Info, select IDs, Manage IDs, find and select the passport, select Delete, and then confirm the deletion a second time.</p>

After adding an ID card to Wallet, you can speed up your TSA security checks at certain airports in the U.S.</p><p>However, if you're new to the idea of digital IDs, the process of adding a state ID or driver's license to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> might seem daunting. In this guide, we'll review everything you need to know about digital IDs, and tell you how to get started.</p>
<h2 id="which-states-support-digital-ids-in-google-wallet-2">Which states support digital IDs in Google Wallet?</h2>
<p>A few years after the first state announced Google Wallet support for IDs, there are still only six states that support it:</p>
<ul><li>Arizona</li><li>California</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Georgia</li><li>Maryland</li><li>New Mexico</li></ul>
<p>Currently, driver's licenses and state IDs have limited uses. Most states require ID holders to carry their physical card on them in addition to their Google Wallet digital ID. While some states and businesses support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a> digital IDs for age and identity verification, the most common use for the passes is for getting through TSA checkpoints in airports.</p><p>Not every airport supports Google Wallet, and for a list of those that do, check out Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12436402?hl=en">support page</a>.</p>
<p>TSA guidance changes regularly, and you can check the most up-to-date information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/when-will-phased-digital-id-rollout-start-which-airportsstates" target="_blank">here</a>. The agency also recommends Google Wallet users follow airport signage at checkpoints to confirm digital IDs will be accepted.</p>

<p>If you have an ID from one of the supported states, you can add it to Google Wallet using the steps below. Be sure to have your physical card handy.</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Wallet app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Add to Wallet</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>ID</strong> from the list.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Driver's license or state ID</strong>.</p><p>5. Press the button corresponding to the <strong>state that issued your ID</strong>.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Get Started</strong>.</p>

<p>7. Follow the <strong>on-screen prompts</strong> to continue setup. The exact process will depend on your state, but you'll need to scan your physical license for verification.</p>

<p>After you've finished, you'll be able to use your digital ID in Google Wallet as your state and federal laws allow. That includes at select TSA checkpoints, and for certain age and identity verification situations in select states.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-state-ids-in-google-wallet-2">Everything else you need to know about state IDs in Google Wallet</h2>
<p>Before leaving the house, know that most jurisdictions require you to carry your physical card in addition to your Google Wallet digital ID. Additionally, you must be using a phone running Android 9 or higher with <strong>Bluetooth and nearby devices</strong> enabled. You can only save the same digital ID to one device, so choose wisely if you have multiple Android devices. Finally, digital IDs are considered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-support-for-california-ids-alongside-apple-wallet">private passes in Google Wallet</a> and are encrypted, but your information is shared with the issuing agency the first time you set it up.</p><p>With all that in mind, you'll be all set to start using your driver's license and digital IDs in Google Wallet.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you know that Google Wallet lets you create an ID pass using your passport?

It's incredibly frustrating, but foldable phones like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold have a unique advantage with features like Made You Look.</p><p>Google wasn't the first company to implement such a feature, as Motorola has a similar feature called "Camera Cartoon" on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. It's one of the benefits of having a foldable phone with an external display, and we couldn't be happier to see Made You Look make its debut on Google's 2024 flagship foldable.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-made-you-look-on-the-google-pixel-fold-2">How to use Made You Look on the Google Pixel Fold</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Unfold</strong> your phone and open the Camera app.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Switch Screen</strong> button.</p><p>3. From the pop-out menu, tap <strong>Made You Look</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of limitations when using Made You Look on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. While it seems that Google understands how beneficial such a feature can be, the implementation is a bit odd.</p><p>When enabling Made You Look, instead of taking advantage of any of the three main cameras, it instead relies on the Cover Screen's 10MP selfie camera. This is rather disappointing to see, as we miss out on the better quality of the higher resolution cameras that are also pointing at the subject.</p><p>The next of which is that you are limited to either a 1x or 1.4x zoom when taking photos, which means that you'll need to be able to get closer to the subject than normal.</p><p>Coming as a bit less of a surprise, another limitation is that you are unable to use Made You Look if you are recording video. In fact, you aren't able to use this feature with any other Camera modes on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> or 9 Pro Fold.</p>
<h2 id="made-you-look-is-simply-fantastic-2">Made You Look is simply fantastic</h2>

<p>There are times when a company includes a feature with a new phone that flies under the radar. Made You Look feels like it falls under that category, especially for those who might not have a need to make sure a little one is actually looking at the camera.</p><p>However, if you're on the other side of the fence and understand the frustrations, then you'll appreciate how helpful things like this can be. Now, we can only hope to see seemingly trivial features make their way onto more and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in the future.</p>

<ul><li>A database discovery shed light on Nothing's three upcoming phones: the Phone 3a, Phone 3a Plus, and the CMF Phone 2.</li><li>The 3a was detailed with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a drop in selfie camera recording capabilities, and a lack of RAW file support.</li><li>The Phone 3, which is now slated for a 2025 debut, was spotted in a Geekbench database with the same Qualcomm chip and 8GB of RAM.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Past rumors have claimed Nothing is working on three phones to join the Phone 3 and it seems a leak might hold some clues.</p><p>Tucked within the IMEI database is information that points toward what these devices could be, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-nothings-2025-surprise-three-new-smartphones-on-the-horizon/">SmartPrix</a>. According to its post, the publication discovered the following model numbers: A059, A059P, and A001. It's stated that these names concern the Phone 3a, Phone 3a Plus, and the CMF Phone 2, respectively.</p><p>The information available in the database seemingly details the Nothing Phone 3a's camera specs. Codenamed "asteroids" (like the retro game), the device could sport a selfie camera with 1080p recording at 30fps and a focal length of 29mm.</p><p>The publication notes that the recording frame rate is a significant drop from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a's</a> 60fps capabilities.</p><p>Regarding its primary sensor, the database highlights a lack of RAW file support, a 26mm lens, 4K resolution video capabilities at 60fps, and Slow-Mo support "up to 480fps at 1080p." The post adds that (likely) the rear cameras will feature "Super Macro," "Super EIS" (electronic image stabilization), and "Super Night Modes."</p><p>The Phone 3a is also supposedly listed with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>Specs concerning the Phone 3a Plus weren't detailed; however, it will likely remain similar to the base 3a. Elsewhere, the publication states its findings show the CMF Phone 2 could rock the same SoC as the 3a.</p>

<p>We're already waiting on the flagship Phone 3 from Nothing; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-rumored-to-have-three-phones-in-active-development-as-we-await-phone-3">a recent rumor suggested</a> we have more on the way. What was said in November (sort of) doubles down on what the recent IMEI database listing details. That old rumor claimed we were waiting on a Nothing Phone 3a and a "Phone 3a Pro," which has seemingly swapped into the 3a Plus.</p><p>Those older rumors lacked specifications; however, it claimed consumers could see these devices during H1 2025, which is the first half of next year.</p><p>Elsewhere, a report in November allegedly spotted the Nothing Phone 3a with a rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">budget-friendly chip</a>. The phone was noticed in a Geekbench database with the same chip SmartPrix discovered for the others: the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC. Early specifications were there but only alluded to 8GB of RAM and Android 15.</p><p>We're also expecting the Phone 3 — and perhaps the 3a and 3 Plus — to go in heavily on AI, at least that's what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">Nothing's CEO Carl Pei wants</a>. Pei teased the company's planned AI enhancements in June as it was "prototyping AI interactions." It was made evident that the Phone 3's planned 2024 launch was delayed purposefully so Nothing could continue crafting its AI software.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly making changes to its mobile phone focus as we head into the new year.</p><p>A recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20241222000037">EtNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung will cut its number of produced foldable phones next year "significantly." The publication cites "industry sources" in stating that the 2024 models, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a>, underperformed after debuting this summer. The number of pre-orders for these models also saw a reduction if you were to compare the Flip 5/Fold 5 to today's devices.</p><p>The Korean OEM is still expected to move ahead with its foldables; however, the report states it might only produce 3 million Flip 7's and 2 million Fold 7's. Combined, this comes out to a total of 5 million 2025 foldable models which, according to the publication, it a ~3 million total reduction compared to 2024.</p><p>There must be balance and it seems that what Samsung takes away from its foldables will be placed into its slab phones, the Galaxy S25 series. The publication's sources claim the next series could see a ~7% increase in produced models. Samsung's "target shipment" is supposedly around 37.4 million S25 units, which contrasts with its previous 35 million goal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">the S24</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, the report highlights the highly anticipated Galaxy "S25 Slim," which could grab a whopping 3 million units.</p>

<p>While it seems like these rumors came from left field, an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">report in July shed light</a> on the Flip 6/Fold 6's underwhelming pre-order performance. The previous 5 series models were a smash hit as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">Samsung shattered records</a> with those models, achieving a total of 1.02 million pre-ordered units. Fast-forward to 2024 and those numbers dipped to 910,000 foldable units in South Korea. The stats say it was a 10% drop, but the Flip 6 was still the most popular as it accounted for 60% of those totals.</p><p>Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">said shortly after Unpacked</a> that he wanted to boost the company's foldable shipments by 10% in 2024. It seems that those ambitions were met by a rocky road, as rumors now point toward an overall reduction in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, previous rumors state Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">is going all in</a> on the Galaxy S25 as it looks to top last year's success. These suspicions come from the company's "supply orders," which showed that it was looking to produce roughly 30 million S25 phones by the end of 2025. Rumors now are painting a slightly "better" picture than what was stated in October as those numbers have climbed by ~7 million units.</p><p>More importantly, 2025 could look <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/2025-could-be-very-different-for-google-and-samsung-heres-why">very different for Samsung</a> — and also Google. The struggling Flip 6 and Fold 6 are a standout, but also its "successful" Galaxy S24 — namely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-samsung-galaxy-s24-sales-growth">the S24 Plus</a> — didn't <em>really </em>help its profits. Samsung Electronics' DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">did apologize</a> publically for the company's lack of innovation and "vowed" to make changes moving forward.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-to-come-on-january-22-2025-leaked-image-suggests">leaked imagery</a> might've clued us into the January 22 launch of the Galaxy S25 series.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-62">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new leak suggests sizes 14 and 15 for the Galaxy Ring are on the way, aligning with the variety offered by other top smart rings.</li><li>A Samsung user guide reveals nine models, including the new SM-Q514 and SM-Q515, which match NEMKO certifications.</li><li>Size 14 is expected to be 23mm in diameter, while Size 15 will be 23.8mm.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Ring currently sticks to a few limited sizes. But rumor has it the company is gearing up to offer more options, making it easier for everyone to find their perfect fit.</p><p>A tip to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-14-15-tdra/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a> suggests Samsung might soon add sizes 14 and 15 for the next-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, catching up with the size variety offered by other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">top smart rings</a> out there.</p><p>A Samsung user guide shared by 91mobiles lists nine Galaxy Ring models, from SM-Q500 to SM-Q509, covering the current sizes. Interestingly, it also mentions two new models—SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. While the guide doesn’t spill more details, these models match certifications from NEMKO, a Norwegian group known for its electronic safety testing.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard this. Reports over the past few months <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-more-sizes-rumor">have hinted at Samsung’s plans to add two more Galaxy Ring sizes</a>.</p><p>More recently, leaker Max Jambor said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-size-expansion-january-rumors">Samsung is set to launch sizes 14 and 15 for the Galaxy Ring in January</a>. It’s solid proof backing up the rumors about expanding size options.</p><p>The upcoming size 14 is rumored to have an inner diameter of 23mm, while the Size 15 model will be a bit roomier at 23.8mm. Both new sizes are expected to weigh 3.2 grams, a bit heavier than the current sizes, which range from 2.3 to 3.0 grams.</p><p>Jambor previously revealed that Galaxy Ring sizes 14 and 15 would be labeled as SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. Backing this up, the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) just certified these models, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/20/samsung-galaxy-ring-sizes-qi-listings/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotting them in WPC’s online <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/21687" target="_blank">database</a>.</p><p>Expanding size options for the Galaxy Ring is a big move for Samsung in the cutthroat smart ring market. Oura, the leader in this space, has a strong grip on the market with a loyal following, setting the bar high.</p><p>To challenge Oura, Samsung can’t just copy what it's doing—it has to one-up the competition in features and user experience. Matching Oura’s size range is a key first step. By offering a better fit for more people, Samsung can make the Galaxy Ring more appealing and attract a bigger crowd.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Ever since OpenAI released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">ChatGPT</a> at the tail end of 2022, the tech industry has been chasing artificial intelligence. For the past few years, tech companies have been ramping up AI development — and you could argue that everyone has been trying to catch OpenAI. Still, it feels like no one has figured out the "killer app" for AI just yet. The year 2024 can be characterized by the tech industry putting AI absolutely everywhere it could, trying to figure out what would stick.</p><p>The new year will mark a significant shift, and the way consumers interact with AI in 2025 is poised to change. Currently, you need to go out of your way to use it. Loading up the ChatGPT website or calling upon the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> assistant is necessary to converse with AI helpers. Next year, that likely won't be the case. AI will be baked into the operating systems and software you use and will become capable enough that it'll expectedly start doing things completely on your behalf.</p><p>The end of this year has brought a few glimpses of what's to come in 2025. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra is being tested by people outside of Google</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a> is the first operating system built with Gemini at the core, and Apple Intelligence is now available with ChatGPT integration.</p><p>We don't have to guess what AI will bring in 2025 — tech companies and their executives have already laid out many of their plans. There are still questions to answer, though. Which companies can actually deliver on their promises, how will they change how we use mobile devices and wearables, and what privacy implications will these shifts have?</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-20.jpg" alt="Gemini response on Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4sUeciYBZHaLoMa5KiYw7h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Up until now, artificial intelligence has powered many individual features and apps. Some have been widely successful — OpenAI reported ChatGPT had 200 million weekly users as of August 2024 — and others less so. Gemini, for example, was downloaded about 780,000 times in September 2024, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1454331/united-states-chatgpt-gemini-app-downloads/" target="_blank">Statista</a>. The number for ChatGPT? That would be 4.2 million downloads in the same month, despite the ChatGPT app already being available on iOS and Android for more than a year.</p><p>Meanwhile, hardware devices created with AI at their center have definitively failed, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rabbit-r1-first-impressions">Rabbit R1</a> and Humane AI Pin are two key examples from this year. Specifically, the Rabbit R1 was a tiny AI device that touted a "Large Action Model" that could take actions on your behalf. Asking the Rabbit R1 to play a song would require it to use Spotify for you, and ordering food would have Rabbit literally use a DoorDash client on a remote server for you.</p><p>The reason these devices failed is because, well, people already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">great phones</a>. They're more powerful and better suited for AI tasks than specialized hardware devices. In 2025, these mainstream devices will become more akin to the failed AI products. The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin both aim to use AI to complete tasks for you, and soon, your smartphones, tablets, and wearables will do the same.</p><p>Rabbit's failed idea regarding the LAM is what Google and others are trying to do right with agentic AI models.</p><p>"Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">in a blog post announcing Gemini 2.0</a>. "With new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant."</p><p>What does that look like? It depends on the company. Google is building Project Astra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">a multimodal AI helper</a> that I tried at Google I/O 2024. It's able to take in your surroundings and use external sources to process queries and then respond with multimodal output. For example, you might ask a question verbally with Project Astra using a camera or a search engine to gain proper context. Then, it can respond with written text, a generated image, or spoken word — or a combination of the above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ" name="google-project-astra-storytelling.jpg" alt="Demoing Google Project Astra's vision capabilities at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tt5thLRTkHf4b6iYE536EJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though Project Astra is only being tested through Google's "trusted tester program," the company has shown off the software on phones, glasses, and headsets. It also announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a>, a brand-new operating system for headsets and wearables with Gemini at the core. It's safe to say that Project Astra will arrive on hardware next year, and that could include Pixel phones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">an unreleased Samsung headset</a>.</p><p>Separately, Google has Project Mariner, a research prototype that will literally browse Chrome for you in the works. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> already has multimodal support on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>, and Apple has Visual Intelligence on iOS 18.2. Last but not least, OpenAI has ChatGPT-4o, a multimodal assistant much like Project Astra.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIIlJt8JERI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>There's something that all these features have in common: they will all become deeply integrated with smartphone, tablet, and wearable operating systems. When available, Project Astra will all but certainly debut on Pixel hardware in 2025. Similarly, ChatGPT-4o is available now on iOS 18.2 since Apple Intelligence features ChatGPT integration.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="izRDpXyLHvMSK4czXRSrDi" name="ios-18-chatgpt" alt="ChatGPT integration in iOS 18." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/izRDpXyLHvMSK4czXRSrDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChatGPT is available system-wide in iOS 18.2, since you can invoke it anywhere with Siri. That's just like how Android users can set Gemini as their default assistant. Additionally, Apple Intelligence's Writing Tools are available anywhere you can access the keyboard. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Samsung will follow suit</a> with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">One UI 7</a>.</p><p>So, two things are going to happen with AI in 2025. On one hand, AI services like Project Astra, ChatGPT-4o, and Visual Intelligence will use multimodal processing and actions to control your mobile devices for you. On the other, smaller AI features will be ingrained into the operating system, so you won't have to go to individual apps to access services like Gemini or ChatGPT.</p><p>Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model" target="_blank">The Verge</a> in an interview: "We really see 2025 as the true start of the agent-based era."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8" name="OpenAI-GPT4o-Announcement.jpg" alt="The announcement of GPT-4o." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGgG32iy2pmgymUqdtABh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5443" height="3061" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the key unknowns for AI in 2025 is whether progress is destined to stall. Some experts believe that AI progress was achieved so quickly in 2023 and 2024 that it is bound to plateau in 2025. Top executives have, on occasion, acknowledged a potential slowdown. However, they're united against the idea of a "wall" or that we've reached the limits of AI progress for now.</p><p>"When you start out quickly scaling up, you can throw more compute, and you can make a lot of progress, but you definitely are going to need deeper breakthroughs as we go to the next stage," Pichai said at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/events/dealbook/sessions/sundar-pichai-building-the-future" target="_blank">Dealbook Summit</a> earlier this month. "So you can perceive it as there's a wall, or there's some small barriers."</p><p>In one of his classic cryptic posts on X (formerly Twitter), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed a similar sentiment, saying, "There is no wall."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there is no wall<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1856941766915641580">November 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Regardless of whether there will or won't be a slowdown, companies like Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google will all be vying to build the fastest and most efficient AI models. While companies such as Google have vastly improved their AI models, OpenAI's headstart and ChatGPT's brand recognition have been significant hurdles for competitors. Even if other companies are better than OpenAI, users might not care enough to switch.</p><p>They'll also be navigating uncharted legal waters as the government and society decide what's up for grabs in terms of AI training material. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> is just one example of an entity currently suing OpenAI for what it alleges is a breach of copyright law.</p><p>Many of these cases are currently ongoing, and we can expect some to come to a head in 2025. Additionally, it's only a matter of time before more governments and regulators try to institute safeguards and protections around AI development and use.</p>
<h2 id="ai-privacy-and-safeguards-will-be-something-to-watch-in-2025-2">AI privacy and safeguards will be something to watch in 2025</h2>
<p>Finally, we'll end our preview of AI in 2025 with a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-must-balance-ai-features-with-privacy">what types of privacy efforts and safeguards will be put in place</a> next year. Unfortunately, I think the lines may become blurred as to what is public and private when it comes to AI.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is commonly referred to as the industry standard for AI privacy — the company developed custom Private Cloud Compute servers that run a hardened OS, and Apple dares hackers to try and crack it. If they do, there's up to a million-dollar reward.</p><p>The problem is that there are three types of security levels baked into Apple Intelligence. Some tasks run on-device using the NPU inside Apple silicon chips, and others are outsourced to Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers. You won't know whether an Apple Intelligence task is running on-device or not. That's up to Apple, and you have to trust it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck" name="apple-intelligence-ios-18.png" alt="Apple Intelligence examples on iPhone running iOS 18" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hj8YhntmS8oLPGThkM7Mck.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, there's ChatGPT integration, which Apple views separately from Apple Intelligence — there are some privacy protections for users, but their requests are still shared with OpenAI, even if they aren't stored. If you link your ChatGPT account with iOS 18, something that's required to use ChatGPT Plus and Pro, you agree to OpenAI's privacy policies, not Apple's.</p><p>In 2025, I think there will be so many AI features baked into our essential devices that it'll be impossible to truly think about the privacy policies and safeguards for each. It'll be akin to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-connect-2024-new-ai-features-privacy-concerns">agreeing to the "terms and conditions"</a> before setting up a new device. We'll have to trust that AI companies are acting in our best interests. The only way we'll know that companies aren't living up to their promises is when they inevitably fall short.</p>

On the one hand, there was a sense of focus and restraint, with products offering improvements that finally give us the impression that Motorola and OnePlus are finally on the right track. On the other hand, both companies fell short in ways that would make them truly stand out among juggernauts like Samsung and Chinese OEMs.</p><p>If they want to succeed in 2025, neither can rest on their laurels and will have to maintain their momentum to get more devices in more hands.</p>

<h2 id="motorola-s-razr-sharp-focus-2">Motorola’s Razr sharp focus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZZmzDFvpgiNo7hddfUbJoa" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-hands-on-08.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZmzDFvpgiNo7hddfUbJoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4036" height="2270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In recent years, Motorola has been seen as little more than a budget option for consumers, launching low-cost phones that compete with Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">A-series devices</a> on both specs and price. Given how prominent smartphone carriers are in North America, consumers will often gravitate toward iPhones, Galaxy phones, and even Pixels.</p><p>Still, that carrier relationship has been quite important for Motorola, and it has helped the company secure a solid spot as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-us-smartphone-sellin-down-4-yoy-in-q3-as-demand-remains-muted/">a top OEM in North America</a>, among other regions around the world, as noted by Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research.</p><p>“Moto has been focusing heavily on prepaid channels with some good traction for G & Edge series [and] some good promos for Razr 2024 [series] in postpaid at T-Mobile and AT&T,” Shah explained in an interview, noting that Latin America has been a stronghold for the company, especially with its budget models.</p><p>A Motorola phone is a safe bet for anyone looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, and they have proven that they can bring plenty of value at lower prices.</p><p>“What has worked for Moto in markets outside USA (especially India) has been focused on CMF (Colors, Materials and Finish) in partnership with Pantone helping it differentiate among the sea of blacks and got the positioning and partnerships right. That is key as well in North America,” Shah notes.</p><p>However, Shah points out that the company still struggles in the higher-end and premium segments where Samsung rules. This is where the Razr series comes in. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">I reviewed the Razr Plus 2024</a> earlier this year and came away extremely impressed with it, even after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-motorola-razr-plus-2024">I pitted it against</a> the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>There’s no doubt that Motorola will focus its efforts on the Razr series in 2025, especially after Lenovo announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-stealing-away-iphone-users">its mobile business is set to double by 2026</a>, thanks to its flagship lineups. Motorola’s marketing efforts for the Razr series have also paid off, with the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">targeting the younger Gen Z and the older millennials</a> who yearn for the nostalgia of a flip phone and something other than an iPhone.</p><p>The question is whether or not Motorola can keep it up in 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="pEASxtK2JCHbPBEaLFXnJ4" name="Moto-AI-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024.jpg" alt="A Motorola executive showcasing Moto AI on stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEASxtK2JCHbPBEaLFXnJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4156" height="2338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola can’t rely solely on the Razr series, particularly in the U.S., where there is a swathe of high-end Samsung phones to choose from and when consumers are unsure about foldable phones. Motorola’s closest premium non-foldable phone is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge 2024</a>, which was a little underwhelming compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Edge Plus 2023</a>. And while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Edge 50 Ultra</a> was among the more impressive phones to launch this year, it never arrived in the U.S., leaving plenty of room for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> to eat up plenty of the premium market share.</p><p>Shah notes that Motorola “is particularly still quite weak in [the] $500+ wholesale premium segment,” and with the growing popularity of the Razr series, Motorola can use the momentum around its name to launch a premium Edge model in North America to challenge Samsung’s dominance, especially if it can get the phone on carrier shelves.</p><p>Of course, if Motorola wants a fighting chance, it’ll have to do more than put a nice new phone on the shelves, according to Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.</p><p>While Ubrani agrees that Motorola has well-rounded phones with incredible value, he notes that “the reality is that they don’t have any notable standout features or points of differentiation and often fall below other brands when it comes to some smartphone basics such as photography.”</p><p>Ubrani suggests that Motorola should offer improved photo and video capture on its phones, something the company hasn’t particularly excelled in. Perhaps the company should consider a partnership like what we've seen with other Android OEMs. OnePlus's partnership with Hasselblad has resulted in impressive camera quality on its recent devices, and Motorola could benefit from a similar collaboration.</p><p>AI could also play a huge role for Motorola in 2025. The company is already beta-testing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite with features that summarize notifications, transcribe recordings, and recall saved content. It also showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a>, which performs actions in apps on the user’s behalf, such as ordering a coffee or Uber. Motorola hasn’t said when this will arrive on phones, but with the recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a>, this can’t be too far off, and I could imagine this launching in 2025.</p><p>Of course, this is all contingent on whether Motorola can avoid having its phones banned in the U.S. The company is currently in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-phones-could-be-banned-in-the-us-what-would-that-mean-for-the-market">patent infringement dispute</a> with Ericsson that could ban its devices in several countries, so hopefully, Lenovo can work things out to avoid a move that would be pretty detrimental to the market.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS" name="oneplus-12-with-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-background" alt="The green OnePlus 12 in front of a grey Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xskHMTNsDeoUaW9jxDHrfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Motorola, which has seen an uptick in the adoption of its flagship phones, OnePlus has struggled to get its phones into consumer hands. The company launched the rather impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> earlier this year, which I recently had the pleasure of using.</p><p>Thanks to the multi-year partnership with Hasselblad, OnePlus has managed to develop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">a camera system that could rival Samsung and even Google</a>, and the company was even among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-just-made-2024s-best-phone-even-better">first to bring Android 15 to its smartphones</a> in 2024, something even Samsung hasn’t managed to do.</p><p>However, none of that matters if no one’s buying the phone, and OnePlus has been absent from the rankings for top OEM shipments for 2024.</p><p>That said, both Shah and Ubrani agree that there is an overall positive perception of the company. So why is that not translating into sales, especially in North America, which is a major market? Ubrani tells me that the issue isn’t with OnePlus.</p><p>“The issue is the state of the U.S. smartphone market and the fact that telcos act as gatekeepers. When OnePlus first started, they eschewed the telcos by going direct-to-consumer, and though it worked well, they were still a very tiny player. They eventually began to work with American telcos, but this proved to be too expensive, and they eventually backed away.</p><p>The reality is that the unlocked piece of the U.S. smartphone market is tiny (sub 10%), and unless brands are willing to spend large sums of money to work with telcos, they don’t stand a chance. I doubt we’ll see much of OnePlus in the U.S. as a result of this.”</p><p>OnePlus could take a page from Motorola’s book regarding carrier partnerships in 2025. The last major OnePlus phone to be sold through a U.S. carrier was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-10-pro-review">OnePlus 10 Pro</a>, and even that was limited to T-Mobile. Since then, anyone who wanted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a> had to buy it straight from the company or unlocked from a retailer. In the U.S., this makes it incredibly difficult to move a significant number of units, even with the cheaper and more accessible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p><p>Shah also points out that despite OnePlus’s attractive portfolio, the $300-$600 price point that it targets in the U.S. “is barely 5% of the total market, which reduces its Total Addressable Market for OnePlus to compete.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY" name="oneplus-13-official-01" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, with the upcoming launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, there is some hope. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-confirms-the-oneplus-13-global-launch-date">global launch is on January 7</a>, and the phone should prove quite impressive based on what we’ve seen from the Chinese variant. It’s unclear if OnePlus’s carrier relationships will get better, but Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, seems optimistic.</p><p>“I think OnePlus is doing about as well as they expect to in the U.S. market without in-store carrier support. That said, I do believe that the next generation of devices are really good, and I've been surprised by the quality of the products across the brand and I think they should do a better job of exposing themselves to consumers with their accessories like the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 which are among my favorite earbuds.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 sets the stage for the next generation and I think we'll see some interesting things from them next month.”</p><p>Additionally, OnePlus has done a good job expanding its product portfolio, launching the mighty impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. This is something we would like to see Motorola do more of in 2025, as the company doesn’t currently have a branded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>. OnePlus may not have a huge U.S. presence, but Motorola’s growing popularity could benefit from an expanded portfolio and a more realized family of devices à la Samsung’s Galaxy lineup.</p><p>One product we hope to see in 2025 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-resistance-rating-camera-specs-tipped">OnePlus Open 2</a>, especially after we came away so impressed by the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. The company skipped a launch in 2024, so this could be the year OnePlus really challenges Samsung and Google, but that depends on its ability to get it into consumer's hands.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aside from OnePlus and Motorola, other smaller companies like TCL, HMD Global, and Nothing are still clawing for market share in the U.S., with TCL having the best prospects among them. That said, despite launching unique and affordable products in 2024, the lack of strong carrier relationships will likely make it hard to grow in 2025.</p><p>Motorola’s willingness to play the game with carriers has solidified its place as a top-selling player, teetering between the budget and premium segments where it can compete with both the smaller and bigger players. Because of this, 2025 could be a big year for Motorola if it continues to play its cards right, but others, like OnePlus, will likely struggle to make any significant headway.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to be rolling out "Ask about this PDF" feature for Gemini Advanced users.</li><li>The feature initially announced at Google I/O is now official for Gemini Advanced users running Android 15.</li><li>It allows users to ask questions about the PDF, which is accessed via Files by Google app.</li></ul>

<p>Early this year at Google I/O, the search giant announced several new features for its AI assistant Gemini. One such nifty feature is “Ask this PDF” for Gemini Advanced users, which is finally seeing a wider rollout.</p><p>As noted by Mishaal Rahman in his recent Threads post, the feature appears to be widely available for Gemini Advanced users. The “Ask about this PDF” feature primarily allows Gemini to give you answers regarding the document when invoked on your Android phone.</p>

<p>For instance, by opening a PDF file from the Files by Google app and triggering Gemini within the app, users can now see a new “Ask about this PDF” option right above the Gemini floating window. Tapping the option would allow them to ask questions about the document and its contents.</p><p>The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">announced</a> earlier at Google IO and is now starting to appear for Gemini Advanced users running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> versions. Rahman also notes that users need to set Gemini as their Assistant on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to use this feature flawlessly. The primary aim of this feature is to save you time from scrolling through multiple pages, particularly if the PDFs have many pages..</p>
<p>Analyzing PDFs isn’t entirely new, as files stored in Google Drive can easily be analyzed with the help of the Gemini extension in the respective app. The integration can analyze and summarize based on the contents of the PDF file.</p><p>However, the new “Ask about this PDF” feature can be helpful for locally stored PDF files on your phone when accessed through the Files by Google app, which also recently got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-has-a-new-pdf-viewer-and-its-ditching-google-drive">new PDF viewer upgrade</a>.</p><p>Instead of the previous Google Drive integration, it is a new document viewer specific to the Files app. The new PDF viewer in the Files by Google app allows users to easily share, star, and take actions while viewing the PDF with a new interface.</p><p>Both new features might enhance the document viewing experience, making it quite convenient for Android 15 users relying on Google’s AI assistant.</p>

Google soared to the top, managing to have one of its largest lineup of devices launch in the fall and a successful year with expanding Gemini.

The company became a strong competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT by launching Gemini in more countries and, by the end of the year, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advance</a> for Gemini Advance subscribers.</p><p>It successfully rolled out stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and even launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 developer preview</a> much earlier than usual. In the fall, Google launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> along with other products, and in the time I’ve been covering technology, it was the biggest launch of products I’ve ever seen Google do.</p><p>However, Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, says it’s hard to tell whether the launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini AI</a> on its Pixel 9 series of phones has helped with sales.</p><p>“[The] Gemini AI effect has yet to be seen fully to boost Google Pixel sales, however, it is definitely one of the key hooks in coming years for Google Pixel to bring flagship Gen AI experiences on the Pixel hardware,” he notes.</p><p>I would agree; I don’t think we’re at a point yet where people are buying a phone because of its AI capabilities. I don’t think there are enough features or average enough use case scenarios where people are using AI daily, and I believe people don’t know enough about AI.</p><p>That being said, one of my favorite features, and in my opinion, the best feature Google came out with this year, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. It is hands down the most innovative feature and one that I actively use on a daily basis. But apart from that, I really haven’t been using many of Gemini’s features on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees and adds that Google needs to focus on innovating Gemini for more general features.</p><p>“Google’s constant iteration and use of user feedback along with improvements in distribution and pricing along with increased marketing spend have helped the company gain share in the past few years. Having differentiating features such as great photography, call screening, Magic Eraser, and other AI features have helped along the way,” he says.</p><p>Ubrani adds that in 2025, he’d also like to see Google expand Gemini across all platforms and devices, not just smartphones. This is something that I hope Google prioritizes next year.</p>

<p>This year, Google also launched one of the biggest suites of products that I’ve ever seen a company do in a long time. More importantly, it launched the Pixel 9 series with Gemini integrated into it.</p><p>I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 series is one of Google's best phone launches</a>. While I had no issues with the phone, there can always be improvements, according to Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy.</p><p>“Google needs to improve the Pixel battery life, by moving to advanced nodes and using the best processors. The same goes for Wi-Fi connectivity and 5G, I was really disappointed how much of a downgrade the Pixel was on connectivity from my S24 Ultra,” he said.</p><p>And Google is likely planning to address this issue with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">rumors indicating that the Pixel 10 </a>lineup will have the Tensor G5. Google has also allegedly finished its design and sent it along for manufacturing at TSMC, ending the era of Samsung-produced designs. TSMC tends to manufacture better chipsets than Samsung. For reference, Qualcomm used Samsung to produce the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, a processor that was infamous for overheating and heavy throttling.</p><p>So, for all we know, the issue surrounding a slower battery might be resolved, making the Pixel 10 lineup an even more premium device.</p><p>I know Google will have a smooth 2025, but I just hope that when it comes to AI, it is really able to push the average consumer and help them understand how to use AI safely and efficiently daily.</p>

<p>It is widely known that Samsung bears the hat of having the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> and is constantly the leader in the Android space. However, this past year, the company faced several challenges despite starting the year strong by launching its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 series of phones</a>.</p><p>But while the S24 was a great series, it didn’t really help improve the downward trajectory of Samsung’s sales. In April 2024, Samsung initiated a six-day workweek for executives to create "a sense of crisis" among the company's leadership team.</p><p>Where Samsung began to really struggle was after launching its Samsung Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, which in many tech circles was more of an iterative update to what it launched last year. The phones weren’t super exciting and weren’t as innovative as they have been in previous years.</p><p>Samsung noticed this to the point where, for the first time, Samsung Electronics' DS Division, Jeon Young-hyun, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">issued a rare apology</a> for the company's failure to innovate. He acknowledged that outsiders are viewing the company's current situation as a "crisis" and vowed to make changes and improvements that will benefit investors, customers, and employees alike.</p><p>It came to a point where other companies were even mocking the release of the Z Fold 6 and how thick it was, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">like Honor engraving a tiny</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold"> "</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">world's smallest apology"</a> on the hinge of a special-edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mRrSVc3Sh3c8cZmKR9VcuB" name="Honor-Magic-V3-apology.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 hinge with an engraved message" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRrSVc3Sh3c8cZmKR9VcuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>IDC also confirmed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share">Samsung had lost smartphone market share</a> as of Q2 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. The research firm also stated that while Samsung moved over 53 million smartphone units in the second quarter, its market share dipped to 18.4 percent, down from 20% in the same period last year. This comes at a time when other China-based brands like Xiaomi and Vivo have been innovating and expanding their market share.</p><p>Ubrani says, “Samsung has rested on their laurels for far too long, and it’s starting to catch up to them. Most Chinese smartphone brands have outengineered and out innovated them in recent years when it comes to things like foldables, battery life, gaming performance, cameras, etc."</p><p>For the longest time, Samsung has focused on competition with Apple when globally they’re competing with many more brands. To be successful, Samsung needs to realize that there’s more than just Apple. Samsung should leverage their scale to iterate faster and continue to invest in marketing like they used to do so during the pre-pandemic era.”</p><p>Shah also notes that the launch of the S and A series helped keep Samsung afloat, but if it wants to get its numbers back up, it needs to focus on innovating its foldables.</p><p>“The foldables performance has been disappointing, which [offset] the good traction for S and A series this year,” he said. “Samsung will have to protect its foldable leadership position as players such as Google, OnePlus and others are coming up with better form-factors. Designs and camera performance.”</p><p>I think Samsung is fine; it is not the type of company to fail, and it knows when to fix itself; case in point, the public apology. However, I do think that Samsung needs to stay focused on itself and not constantly look at what other companies are doing. Yes, to stay in the game, you need to see what others are doing, but looking too much will distract you.</p><p>Sag agrees, adding that Samsung needs to stop looking at what Apple is doing to innovate because its customers don’t care about Apple.</p><p>“Samsung needs to lean into what makes Android fun and exciting, people are not really switching between Android and iOS (Razr+ excepted). Samsung needs to figure out how to execute Galaxy AI in a more meaningful manner and get back its reputation as the carrier of the Android banner,” he said.</p><p>I would wholeheartedly agree that Samsung needs to remind its users why it’s the best innovator and why it was the first to introduce foldables and excite its users again.</p><p>I’ve been covering technology for many years, and 2024 has been a fascinating year for both Google and Samsung. I expect a lot from both companies in 2025, and I can’t wait to see how they innovate more.</p>

<hr>
<p>MediaTek’s Dimensity 8400 is here to shake up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone segment</a>. The big twist is that it scraps the usual "little" cores this time around.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 goes all-in with an "All Big Core" CPU design, ditching the usual mix for eight high-power Arm Cortex-A725 cores clocked at 3.25GHz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-8300-announced">Compared to the Dimensity 8300</a>, this shift delivers a massive 41% bump in multi-core performance, as per MediaTek. Even better, it pulls off this power move while cutting peak energy use by 44%.</p><p>This design mirrors what we’ve seen in flagship Android chips, which have also ditched low-power cores. What makes it groundbreaking, though, is that it’s the first mid-range processor to embrace this bold design.</p><p>Backing up the CPU is a strong Neural Processing Unit (NPU) built to speed up Generative AI tasks. On top of that, MediaTek’s Dimensity Agentic AI Engine (DAE) takes regular AI apps to the next level, turning them into smarter, autonomous systems. This means the chipset predicts your device’s power needs, optimizing performance before you even notice a slow-down.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 also packs a powerhouse GPU with the Arm Mali-G720 MC7, a big step up from the Mali-G615 MC6. MediaTek says this upgrade delivers a 24% boost in peak performance and a 42% jump in power efficiency. With extras like MediaTek’s Frame Rate Converter and Adaptive Gaming Technology 3.0, the Dimensity 8400 clearly wants to dominate mobile gaming.</p><p>Powered by the NPU 880, the chipset is built to handle large language models, making it capable of creating awesome media and giving smart, context-aware responses.</p><p>The Dimensity 8400 comes with a top-tier imaging system, led by the MediaTek Imagiq 1080 ISP. With remosaic tech, it captures more light, speeds up autofocus, and shoots super-sharp, high-res photos.</p><p>It also supports HDR video recording across the full zoom range, so you can capture footage with amazing dynamic range.</p><p>For connectivity, the Dimensity 8400 packs a 5G-Advanced modem with up to 3CC-CA, offering peak download speeds of 5.17 Gbps.</p><p>And when it comes to displays, this chipset supports WQHD+ screens with up to 144Hz refresh rates, plus dual-screen support for better multitasking and productivity.</p><p>The first phones with the Dimensity 8400 should hit by the end of 2024, but you'll mostly see it in 2025 models.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google TV now offers over 170 free channels, giving US viewers even more content to explore.</li><li>The update is available for anyone with the latest Google TV software, and you can find the new channels in the Google TV Freeplay app.</li><li>Some of the new channels might be temporary, especially those with holiday-themed names.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google TV already has a solid lineup of free channels with plenty of variety for all kinds of viewers. But knowing we can never get enough content, the platform has added even more. With this update, US viewers now have access to over 170 free channels.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/21/google-tv-free-channels-holidays-2024/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this update should now be live for anyone with a TV or streaming device running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> software. You’ll find the expanded channel lineup right in the Google TV Freeplay app.</p><p>Freeplay gives you instant access to free, ad-supported live channels as soon as you set up a new Google TV device. However, it’s only available in the U.S. for now.</p><p>Google TV’s latest channel drop builds on a recent expansion. Just a few months back, the platform added 14 new channels, bumping the total to 150.</p><p>The new channels are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Designated Survivor</li><li>Places & Spaces – The Great Christmas Light Fight</li><li>Best of Dr Phil</li><li>Xumo Free Holiday Movie Channel</li><li>Xumo Free Holiday Classics</li><li>Xumo Christian Christmas</li><li>Continuum</li><li>Z Nation</li><li>The Design Network</li><li>Filmrise: Classic TV</li><li>UFC</li><li>Unbeaten</li><li>Big 12 Studios</li><li>Waypoint TV</li><li>PursuitUP</li><li>Stingray Greatest Holiday Hits</li><li>Stingray Soul Storm Christmas</li><li>Stingray Hot Country Christmas</li></ul>
<p>The latest update boosts Google TV Freeplay’s channel count to 171. However, 9to5Google points out that some channels might only stick around for the holidays, judging by their festive names.</p><p>Alongside this expansion, MotorTrend Fast TV has quietly disappeared. This constant shuffle of adding and dropping content is expected to continue through 2025, keeping the streaming scene as unpredictable as ever.</p><p>Google TV kicked things off with 80 free channels when it launched ad-supported TV in early 2023. By the end of the year, that number climbed to 117. Last August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-is-cranking-up-the-content-with-a-fresh-batch-of-free-channels">it hit 136</a>, and September brought 14 more to the party.</p><p>Accessing these channels is super easy. Just head to the 'Live' tab, scroll through your recommendations, or use the Google TV channel player to jump right in.</p>

<p>As we say farewell to a 2024 filled with new smartwatches, smart rings, and other fun wearables, I'm using my year's experience as Wearables lead for Android Central — and insights from key wearable analysts — to predict what 2025 has in store for us as smartwatch fans.</p><p>We had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-2024-retrospective-theyre-getting-shockingly-good">very strong year for smartwatches in 2024</a>, but some trends, like an increased focus on AI insights and better health tools on mainstream smartwatches, were half-baked. They were the precursor to what should be a greater push in these areas with the next generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>, Apple Watches, and other wearables.</p><p>Below, I'll break down the surefire predictions, likely possibilities, and wishful guesswork for smartwatch, smart ring, and smart glasses trends in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="a-wider-range-of-smartwatches-especially-flagships-2">A wider range of smartwatches, especially flagships</h2>
<p>Garmin was one of the first to get away with selling a smartwatch that costs as much as a smartphone with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix series</a>, but Apple brought that idea into the mainstream with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Ultra series</a>, and then Samsung happily followed Apple's lead and ditched its mid-tier Classics and Pros for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. In 2025, look for more brands to start testing loyal users' willingness to spend more on pricier status-symbol smartwatches, says Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.</p><p>"Samsung (thanks to Apple) kicked off the Ultra tier, and we expect more vendors to also launch higher-priced models," he predicts. That could mean a Pixel Watch Ultra, OnePlus Watch Ultra, or a titanium TicWatch. And that could easily apply to other fitness brands that have typically tried to undercut Apple/Galaxy Watch prices.</p><p>At the same time, Ubrani also thinks the inverse is true: We're going to see "more options for more consumers," especially thrifty watch buyers. The Galaxy Watch FE and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> started that trend this year, and we could see even more budget or mid-level watches with strategic downgrades next year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C" name="Gemini-2.0" alt="The Gemini 2.0 graphic provided by Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WK7yDjQB2kjcz6MAYd2y4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I already brought up this point in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-expect-from-android-and-wear-os-smartwatches-in-2025">Wear OS 2025 predictions column</a>, but I suspect that Apple, Google, and Samsung will shove their big-name AIs into smartwatches in 2025 with the same urgency and eagerness as they did with phones this year. That means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-major-gen-ai-bixby-rework-arrives">Bixby AI</a>) on Android watches and Apple Intelligence on Apple Watches, in some form.</p><p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees in principle that AI will become "the connective fabric between all of our wearables," from watches and earbuds to rings and glasses. "Apple Intelligence and Gemini will be big drivers, but so will Meta AI and possibly even ChatGPT."</p><p>However, he also cautioned that he thinks Google "still needs to figure out a way to get Gemini to run smoothly on such performance-limited hardware," noting that it "could come with RISC-V or some other more capable platform."</p><p>He's particularly excited about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V</a>'s potential for Android watches, saying "the payoff could be huge" for its custom chips. But even if new chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> have more compute power, the tokens needed for a conversational LLM may simply be too much for the watch form factor right now, and RISC-V itself could "take a bit longer" to arrive.</p><p>Ubrani seemed to agree that "AI will make a splash [in 2025], though this may not exclusively be on-device." Instead, just like we got cloud-based AI analysis like Samsung Health's Energy Score and Wellness Tips in 2024, we'll see "more personalized experiences" for health and fitness in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse.jpg" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 is the first Google device to feature the Loss of Pulse feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1900" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You know how much data smartwatches can track already, from heart health and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">sleep apnea</a> to skin temperature and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-to-get-a-new-sensor-that-boosts-health-tracking">AGE index</a>. The Pixel Watch 3 added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">Loss of Pulse Detection</a>, while most mainstream watches warn you if you've fallen or catch if your heart rate is higher or lower than normal. So, what's next?</p><p>Stop me if you've heard this before, but blood pressure might roll out more widely. Samsung has offered it for years but without FDA approval. Apple might add it to the Ultra 3 in 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apple-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-2025/">MacRumors</a>), though leaks have suggested this for years now. Ubrani predicts that the feature will "come to more devices and more countries" in 2025.</p><p>Otherwise, he believes that we'll start to see a "more holistic approach to health tracking" in 2025, incorporating data from third-party devices into first-party health analysis. For example, we could see "glucose monitors working with smartwatches or in-home devices that track environmental impact on sleep and recovery."</p><p>I myself would love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hydration-and-sweat-loss-arent-the-afterthought-fitness-watches-treat-them-as">better hydration and sweat tracking</a> on watches in 2025, so you know when you need to refuel — or if you're close to passing out — during tough activities.</p>
<h2 id="smart-rings-will-keep-growing-then-plateau-2">Smart rings will keep growing — then plateau</h2>
<p>Ubrani shared IDC's sales estimates and projections for watches and smart rings. Smart rings sold about 880,000 units in 2023 and doubled to 1.77 million in 2024. By 2025, they believe the number will climb to 2.54 million, a significant 43% boost.</p><p>No doubt, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> will keep getting better with new health insights. But IDC predicts that the subsequent jumps for 2026 (15%), 2027 (9%), and 2028 (5%) will decrease, with smart rings probably not growing much beyond 3–4 million anytime soon. That's a far cry from smartwatches (156.8 million in 2025) and fitness bands (35.3 million). Even smart glasses are expected to grow faster (more on that next).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I asked Ubrani why he thinks smart rings won't grow to supplant other wearables, he blamed "supply challenges inherent to the form factor," like the need for a sizing kit and the challenge of different inventory for every size and finish of a ring.</p><p>Also, "from a consumer perspective, pricing is a barrier," and "the market isn't huge because many would find a smartwatch to be good enough."</p><p>"I personally use [a smart ring] every day," Sag says, but "they are more of a niche product that's predominantly focused on health...rings simply don't replace smartwatches, they are mostly complementary."</p><p>He specifically praised the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> and how it can "enable better UX" but argued that "its limitation to Android only hampers its potential." I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-samsung-needs-to-release-galaxy-ring-on-iphone-challenge-apple-ring">argued that exact point last year</a> about Galaxy exclusivity, so it felt a bit vindicating.</p><p>As for what I <em>want</em> to see from more smart rings in 2025, I covered that in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">previous column</a>: haptics for alarms and notifications, better "find my ring" tools, NFC support, more health vectors like passive AFib detection, and more unique styles than the typical thick-band look most of them share. And generally speaking, I just want <em>more</em> smart rings from mainstream brands; give me an Apple Ring, Pixel Ring, Garmin Ring, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="smart-glasses-break-out-into-the-mainstream-2">Smart glasses break out into the mainstream</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart glasses might not fit your typical vision of "wearables," but they're actually quite similar to smart rings. Hear me out: They're something you typically buy based on your fashion sense and taste. They offer features already available in other popular smart tech like audio (earbuds), cameras (smartphones), and AI (phones again). And you have to design them for multiple styles and finishes, making them harder to sell and distribute.</p><p>Ubrani pointed out many of these concerns, saying that "most consumers don't need" AI, music, and photography in one $300 package on top of an expensive smartphone cost. People who already wear glasses "might be delighted to have additional features built-in," but these electronic tech companies "don't have the expertise to sell eyewear," especially through traditional channels. And those who <em>don't</em> wear glasses "might not want to wear glasses unless it's solving an unsolved issue."</p><p>Yet despite all these roadblocks to success, IDC projects that smart glasses' sales will jump from 2.5 to 3.5 million in 2025 and an additional 1 million each year through 2028, making them the fastest-growing wearable category.</p>

<p>"Smart glasses are not going to remain niche," Sag argued. "They will continue to grow because they are the most natural platform for AI and I believe that Meta's sales will continue to grow as it starts to co-market with EssilorLuxottica." Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-announces-long-term-essilorluxottica-eyewear-deal">won the bidding war for EssilorLuxottica</a>, allegedly beating out Google's bid, giving them the edge with their popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a>.</p><p>Beyond Meta, Google recently announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR platform</a> that'll power mixed-reality headsets, AR glasses, and smart glasses. Samsung also announced its "Project Moohan" XR headset, but we've also seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-xr-ar-devce-2025-launch-plans-rumor">leaked reports about Samsung AR glasses</a> arriving next year.</p><p>Unlike displayless smart glasses, it's hard to say whether AR glasses are ready for massive sales. We like brands like Xreal that use AR glasses as extended displays for gaming — and we're excited for the spatial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One Pro</a> coming next year — but we're still years away from the wide-FOV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> meant to be worn outside or all day.</p><p>We'll see whether AR glasses prototypes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Google's Project Astra</a> will make an appearance in 2025 and whether they will take the world by storm like Google Glass (temporarily) did. Sag was much more bullish about the prospects of AR glasses in the next few years, while Ubrani said an AR display would "change some of this conversation, but distribution will remain a challenge."</p>

<p>I wrote last week about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-2024-retrospective-theyre-getting-shockingly-good">how surprisingly <em>good</em> smartwatches have gotten in 2024</a> in terms of speedy app performance, reliable health & fitness data, and a wider range of designs and brand options. Whatever happens in 2025, we'll still have that baseline of quality to count upon.</p><p>My personal wishlist for new smartwatch features in 2025 is very niche: I'd love to see more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">rucking sports modes</a> that let you input your pack's weight and take it into account for training load, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-leaks-im-hoping-for-two-major-changes">leaked Garmin Instinct 3</a> might do just that. I want customizable Google Maps courses you can download to Wear OS watches for offline turn-by-turn navigation during hikes and workouts. And I want all watch brands to continue to improve their heart rate algorithms and sensors so they're not all so mid-tier when it comes to anaerobic track workouts, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">I don't need to wear a chest strap</a>.</p><p>What are your hopes and predictions for smartwatches, smart rings, and smart glasses in 2025? I hope whatever they are, they come true in the new year.</p>

<p>When it came time to reflect on my first full year as Wearables lead for Android Central, I thought about how I've been run ragged (literally) trying to test and review one smartwatch after another, but also how I didn't mind because, by and large, most of the watches I assessed were so darn good.</p><p>I reviewed (or will finish reviews for) watches from Apple, COROS, Garmin, Google, OnePlus, Polar, Samsung, Suunto, and Withings, plus my first-ever smart ring. And unlike my freelance days reviewing TVs, smart home tech, earbuds, and other hit-and-miss gadgets that I used and forgot about, there weren't any smartwatch "duds" where I had to find the silver lining amid the mediocrity.</p>
<p>None of my smartwatches were perfect, and several were good rather than great. Sometimes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-has-underwhelmed-me-despite-how-great-it-is">they underwhelmed me</a> despite <em>being</em> great. But all the brands I'd tested before improved in marked ways, and they all have a level of reliability that you can trust their sleep stats, heart rate zones during runs, GPS tracking, recovery time estimates, and other data that would've been erratic guesswork just a few years ago.</p><p>Basically, anyone short of a pro athlete can count on the health, fitness, and sleep data being <em>good enough</em> — and several options are trending toward true consistency. That's easy to take for granted! But for me to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">run a 20-miler wearing four watches</a> and have all four watches' results be so similar is pretty amazing, showing that the core data can be trusted if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">choose the right watch</a>.</p><p>And outside of fitness, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">Wear OS watches are better than ever</a>, while Apple continues to dominate the sales charts, keeping its fans happy by tweaking its familiar design to be thinner and improving its health analysis.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM" name="Wear-OS-watches-hero" alt="A pile of Wear OS watches: The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, 6, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro; the Google Pixel Watch 3 and 2; and the OnePlus Watch 2R." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmdcQ593Sbg8a3GbAEY6hM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Some of the smartwatches I've reviewed over the last couple of years </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, it's easy for <em>me</em> to feel happy about the state of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> in 2024; these smartwatch brands catered to my needs <em>and</em> made me look prescient with their newest features.</p><p>At the end of last year, I argued that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-and-fitness-watches-tried-stealing-each-others-tricks-in-2023">traditional smartwatches and fitness watches were trying to morph into each other</a>, with Apple and Samsung focusing more heavily on fitness and brands like Garmin trying to make their platform more accessible to mainstream people.</p><p>This year, you had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> lean fully into running coaching, cardio load, and other running perks that sure made me happy, if not my gym-loving colleagues. The same goes for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>'s dual-band GPS and extra HR LEDs for better running data, or the Apple Watch Series and Ultra watches adding training load. They played right into my expectations and made fitness the centerpiece of their marketing.</p><p>I argued that most fitness watch brands would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitness-watches-mip-to-amoled-transition-long-overdue">stop using MIP displays and transition to AMOLED</a> at lower price points. And just like that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">COROS PACE Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> all used AMOLED, abandoning MIP tech that was great for outdoor use but annoyingly low-res and dim indoors. It's obvious that these brands see better visual accessibility as the future.</p><p>In January, I also argued that Garmin needed to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">indoor workout coaching</a> on par with its Garmin Coach for running and cycling. Wouldn't you know it, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> added a strength coach with auto-generated multi-month training plans, and the tool has since come to more affordable models like the Forerunners. Now, I have a useful way to get cross-training guidance using at-home weights.</p>

<p>Not every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatches-wearables-wishlist-2024">prediction and hope for wearables in 2024</a> came true; Google ignored my pleas for a "Fitbit renaissance" and effectively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">canceled Fitbit watches for good</a>. But it certainly was the "year of the smart ring," with total sales literally doubling from 880,000 to 1,769,000, according to numbers IDC shared with Android Central.</p><p>We've only just begun to see the uptick of "AI on your wrist," as analysts assured me would happen, but Samsung's Energy Score, Wellness Tips, and auto-suggested replies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> certainly qualify! And I'm confident that 2025 will be the year Gemini and Apple Intelligence make it onto smartwatches in some form.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Garmin-Fenix-8-run-activities" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, both showing Run activity start screens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2024, companies sold 154.1 million smartwatches and 36.6 million fitness bands, per data shared by IDC. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-wearable-band-market-q3-2024">Canalys</a> shows that fitness bands have bounced back slightly from 17 to 20% market share thanks to popularity in Latin America and EMEA. However, they've massively declined from their 50% share in 2020, falling short of smartwatches <em>and</em> basic watches.</p><p>Economically, companies like the bigger profit margins of smartwatches and have largely abandoned fitness trackers to Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei. Generally, people prefer the <em>look</em> of smartwatches more than cheap fitness bands, and the stats show they'll pay for style.</p><p>But beyond that, I think the growing smartwatch sales numbers — and higher sales of premium "Ultra" watches — is the result of smartwatches being marketed so effectively as being <em>life-saving</em>. They signal 911 if you fall, notice if your pulse is erratic, tell you how long you need to rest after a run to avoid serious injury, and catch if you have sleep apnea or (for some brands) a fever.</p><p>It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-challenge-of-using-smartwatches-and-smart-rings">not fun when your watch tells you something's wrong</a>. But even if ignorance is bliss, I'd rather know about a problem ahead of time than have it blindside me when the problem gets worse. And I think consumers would rather pay $300 for a watch that's 90% accurate than a $50 band with hit-or-miss stats.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm excited to see what new tricks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> pull off in 2025. Some of them will undoubtedly be gimmicky, and not everything will work well. But the core experience is better than ever, and I'm happy that I'm privileged enough to keep testing those features and sharing my thoughts, guesses, and rants about wearables with you.</p><p>It's easy for tech categories to fall into ruts, and just a few years back, it felt like most smartwatches were these squircle clones of one another with little innovation. But now, a bunch of different brands are playing to their strengths and giving consumers a wealth of options.</p><p>Since my job is often about nitpicking or complaining about smartwatch features, it's nice to reflect once in a while that things are, on the whole, good.</p>

With this new update, we're starting to get a better idea of what to expect from the next major update.</p><p>There are plenty of under-the-hood changes to help improve app startup, support for adaptive refresh rate, and haptics. There are also updates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> with support for more data types and APIs for sharing health records. The cloud photo picker is getting a search function, and there are new APIs for predictive back animations and behaviors.</p><p>Of course, as is usual with developer previews, there are tons of features under the hood that Google is working on, but it's likely not all will make it to beta or stable. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get a good look at the user-facing features, as the Android 16 beta is expected to arrive in January.</p>

This is due to a patent dispute between the companies that found Lenovo infringing on Ericsson's 5G patents.</p><p>The phones in question? The Moto G, Edge, and Razr lineups, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-finds-lenovo-smartphones-infringe-ericsson-patents-2024-12-17/">Reuters</a>. Those are the company's primary smartphone families, with the Moto G lineup performing strongly among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>, while the Edge and Razr lineups have been popular enough in the U.S. and globally that the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-stealing-away-iphone-users">set to double its business by 2026</a>. As such, the prospects of a ban in the U.S. would be pretty catastrophic for the company and the market, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">the loss of LG years ago</a>.</p><p>Ericsson has won preliminary rulings against Motorola before and is also involved in patent disputes in other regions, but Lenovo has so far managed to stave off a ban in South America. Hopefully, Lenovo can do the same for the U.S., and the two companies can come to some sort of agreement.</p>

It's mostly bug fixes aimed at addressing issues that cropped up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">first One UI 7 beta</a> released just a couple of weeks ago. This includes faster transitions, improved GPS, Quick Panel fixes, and much more. However, per the changelog, one known issue that's been pointed out is that the Tool panel sometimes does not appear in the Edge Panels.</p><p>If you're new to the One UI 7 beta, the update may come in at around 4GB, while those updating from the first beta may have only a 1GB download. For now, the beta remains exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series in select countries.</p><p>We recently published our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">first impressions of the One UI 7 beta</a>, highlighting the new UI elements (a vertical app drawer!), new features, and more.

According to OnePlus, the 13R will feature a massive 6,000mAh battery, which is larger than the 5,500mAh battery on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. It will also apparently feature a new Gorilla Glass 7i, a thickness of 8mm, and a flat display.</p><p>There's still a lot we don't know about the 13R, such as the chipset, charging speed, and price. It will likely sport a lesser chip than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that will be featured in the OnePlus 13 and likely less RAM than its flagship sibling's 24GB max.</p><p>Both phones will launch globally on January 7, 2025.</p>

It sounds a lot like what Google is promising with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>, which aims to use AI to see and remember things for the user that can be brought up later.</p><p>Additionally, live translate will automatically translate speech to English, supporting Spanish, French, or Italian, and it will either be played through the built-in speakers or appear as transcripts on your phone.</p><p>These new live features are available via Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/early-access-program/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam">Early Access Program</a>, which is available in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Lastly, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are gaining support for Shazam in the U.S. and Canada, meaning you can ask it about a song that's playing, and it will use Shazam to identify it for you. One less reason to pull out your phone.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for headphones that include Bluetooth, USB-C, and 3.5mm connectivity; you want high-quality audio that isn't overwhelmingly bass-heavy;</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need wireless headphones with active noise cancellation; you'd rather upgrade to the Beats Studio Pro headphones; you need wireless Hi-Res audio support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review" target="_blank">Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones</a> were released earlier this year, offering a very clean audio experience with mechanical buttons, up to 50 hours of battery life, and multiple audio connectivity options. Our review lays out how great they are as a pair of entry-level wireless headphones, offering audio quality that's more crisp and straightforward than past releases from Beats—which have naturally been louder in the low-end.</p><p>While the drivers aren't as inherently bassy as past headphone releases from Beats, the Solo 4s do still include the ability to EQ using the mobile app, so you can customize them to be this way if you want to.</p><p>Interestingly, these don't include active noise cancellation (ANC), so if that's a dealbreaker, you'll want to consider other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>. Additionally, they don't support wireless Hi-Res formats like aptX Lossless or LDAC, which might be a need for some. Beyond that, however, it's hard to beat this level of audio quality from a name-brand for under $100, so it might be worth trying them out.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">our glowing 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold takes everything that&apos;s great about Pixel phones and packs it into a sleek, foldable phone package. You get the super-efficient Tensor G4 processor straight out of the box, plus two vibrant 120Hz displays, seven years of guaranteed OS/security updates, and all of the useful Gemini AI software features you could ever need. As a Pixel device, you can also expect some pretty amazing camera software and battery life. </p><p>If Google would simply allow stylus support, the 9 Pro Fold could easily stand toe-to-toe against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Handsfree-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D198N6Y6"><strong>also discounted for Christmas, by the way</strong></a>). </p><p>Of course, if you just can&apos;t bear the thought of spending 1,500 bucks on a phone (understandable), it&apos;s worth mentioning that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HV2PC9"><strong>Amazon is also carving 19% off the base model Pixel 9</strong></a>.

<hr>
<p>Google has introduced Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, an experimental AI model that lays out how it tackles tough problems in order to let you peek into its thought process and make it easier to see how it works.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> Flash Thinking blends Flash tech’s speed with the reasoning chops of OpenAI’s o1 model. The difference is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> spells out its thought process, while o1 keeps things behind the curtain. That clear breakdown makes it a win for anyone needing to follow complex reasoning and dodge surprise AI slip-ups.</p><p>This unique approach helps it outshine the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> on tougher challenges.</p><p>Logan Kilpatrick, head of product for AI Studio, calls this model a big first step in Google’s push for smarter AI reasoning (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Unlike most AI systems, these reasoning models can self-check their work, reducing common errors. The trade-off is that it takes a bit longer to get answers—sometimes seconds or even minutes.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just when you thought it was over... we’re introducing Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, a new experimental model that unlocks stronger reasoning capabilities and shows its thoughts.The model plans (with thoughts visible), can solve complex problems with Flash speeds, and more 🧵<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1869789820308074837">December 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google DeepMind’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, showed off on X some capabilities of Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to see Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking in action? Check out this demo where the model solves a physics problem and explains its reasoning. pic.twitter.com/Nl0hYj7ZFS<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1869790032296579169">December 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The demo featured the AI solving tough physics problems by breaking them into smaller steps, showcasing its knack for methodical problem-solving and delivering solid, reliable results.</p><p>In another demo from Kilpatrick, the model shows off its impressive reasoning skills by combining visual and text data to solve a problem. It highlights how well the model can process and blend info from different sources.</p><p>While early demos have shown some missteps or missed details, it’s important to remember that this model is still in its early stages. Even so, these first impressions highlight the impressive potential of the DeepMind AI architecture.</p><p>The new model is free for everyone to try on Google’s AI Studio platform. That said, it has a 32,767-token limit, so it’s a bit capped compared to other versions. Still, it’s impressive how quickly it handles tricky problems that usually leave regular AI models scratching their heads.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there's such a thing as a tech hoarder, I'm sure I qualify. I have over 350 phones in the house, over a hundred earbuds, a ridiculous number of chargers, cables, power banks, and so on. I had a decent system to organize all the tech in the house, but the last two years have been particularly busy, and I let the clutter pile up to such an extent that I don't really know where things are any longer.</p><p>Recently, I embarked on a decluttering project to organize my tech better, and while it was labor-intensive, the upside is that I can now reliably locate products I need without wasting 30 minutes, and I consider that a win. So here's what worked for me and how you can get started.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-declutter-cables-and-accessories"><span>How to declutter cables and accessories</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JAdNqNg66s6C82tctk28Go" name="Decluttering tech" alt="Storage draw containing cables and chargers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAdNqNg66s6C82tctk28Go.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Cables contribute to clutter in a big way. I have hundreds of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> in the house, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/five-years-later-the-kindle-oasis-is-still-the-best-e-reader-ive-used-and-thats-a-problem">Kindle Oasis</a> is the only device that I regularly use that still needs Micro-USB, I somehow have a few dozen of those cables lying around that I didn't throw out.</p><p>I still need Lightning cables because of older iPhones and iPads, USB-A, Mini USB, and USB-B cables that I use with various synths and other music production gear, and USB Micro-B cables to use with old external hard drives. Similarly, I have over a hundred wired earbuds, and while they don't take up much room, there's no good way to organize them, particularly with IEMs.</p><p>That's just the start of the cable clutter; I have dozens of Ethernet cables of varying lengths, HDMI and DisplayPort cables, and a boggling number of RCA audio cables. While I had a good system to categorize cables in the past, things have gotten out of hand in the last two years, and nowadays, it's a bigger chore to dig through the cables than just buying new ones.</p>
<p>My solution? I use cable ties, and I started getting storage boxes where I can easily categorize cables based on need or utility. I bought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ZHSMYUP-Management-Compartments-Electronic-Accessories/dp/B0CGPJ75YB">these storage boxes</a> to store USB cables, and there are larger variants if you need to house Ethernet or HDMI cables. These storage boxes are just as great with earbuds and chargers as well.</p><p>You can also get retractable cables; I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0C858GPF9">this Baseus cable</a> over the last 12 months, and it's just so much more convenient. I just got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rollingsquare.com/products/incharge%C2%AE-xs-240w-4in1-keyring-cable">inCharge XS</a>, and this tiny cable has USB-C, USB-A, and Lightning connectors, and it is able to charge devices up to 240W. With these multi-connector cables and retractable options, you don't have to deal with as much clutter, and they're just easier to manage.</p><p>The best thing you can do is give away cables you don't need. This is what I did recently; I put a few dozen old chargers and cables in a bag and handed it away, and it felt great. I'd recommend holding on to three of each cable variety with older cables because you don't ultimately need to have a lot of those lying around.</p><p>Another thing that made a big difference is labeling things. The only reason I'm able to find anything at all is because I finally started labeling all accessories and cables, and I use this 10-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/LABELWORKS-LW-PX300-Industrial-Label-Maker/dp/B08JQMFZ6F">Epson label maker</a> that's still going strong — the same cannot be said of my Epson printer.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FAphrdAR94JDkQSi7CZKEo" name="Decluttering tech" alt="GaN charger with cables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAphrdAR94JDkQSi7CZKEo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been testing phones for over a decade now, and I amassed quite a collection of phones, including the latest flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a>, and everything in between. I have a charging routine at the start of every quarter where I make sure all of these devices are charged to 50% (what do you do on a Sunday?), and once that's done, they go back into their boxes.</p><p>I tried several techniques for storing phones, and nowadays, I just have a dozen of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sockerbit-box-with-lid-white-80316067/" target="_blank">these IKEA storage boxes</a>, with phones arranged by manufacturer (Xiaomi alone takes up four boxes). I store chargers in individual boxes, and charging cables are now sorted into four categories: USB-C PD cables that deliver at least 100W, USB-C to USB-A cables, manufacturer-bundled cables, and regular USB-C cables to transfer data.</p><p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Antistatic-Shielding-Anti-Static-Motherboard-Electronic/dp/B0B6G3H6DK">anti-static bags</a> with hard drives, DRAM modules, and motherboards, but the rest of the general tech products — routers, NAS servers, tablets, keyboards, mice, headsets, and docking stations — go into individual shelves. The biggest issue in this area is finding the cable associated with the product, so these days, I just put power cables in sealable bags and label them accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have old phones sitting in a drawer, I'd suggest charging the devices at least every six months to ensure the battery doesn't balloon or degrade. You can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-how-i-reuse-old-phones">reuse older phones</a>, and they hold up pretty well for a lot of tasks. For example, you obviously can't use something like the LG G4 as a daily driver; the phone doubles up as a media player, and the built-in DAC is brilliant in its own right. One of my best use cases for old phones is as a security camera — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://alfred.camera/">Alfred</a> is a great utility.</p><p>Another solution is to just sell, give away, or donate older tech. I'm particularly bad at this, and while I don't like giving away phones, I do a good job handing out devices to family members and friends. Selling older tech is another option, but you don't get much — a better choice is to see if your carrier has a trade-in offer toward a newer device. Barring that, my recommendation is to use a service like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://swappa.com/">Swappa</a> to sell old phones, notebooks, and any unwanted tech that's just sitting around. Regardless of how you give away old phones or notebooks, you will need to make sure you securely erase your data. <br><br>If you've got decades-old products that don't have any material value, you should consider recycling them. Best Buy has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025">good recycling program</a>, and most counties offer a recycling service in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-15.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Organizing digital media can be a daunting task. I did this exercise at the start of 2024 when I was setting up a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">100TB home server</a>, and I realized I have the same data in at least three different locations. If you have a local media collection, I'd recommend going through the data and using a tool like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a> to better organize your content. With music in particular, I suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a>; I used it quite a bit in the past.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> is a terrific utility in this regard, and it takes care of all the organization and metadata. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://roon.app/en/">Roon</a> is similarly great for organizing your music library, and while it has unique features, it is quite costly at $15 a month. When it comes to photos, a utility like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digikam.org/about/" target="_blank">digiKam</a> is handy for organizing and adding tags, and if you need a self-hosted solution, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://immich.app/" target="_blank">Immich</a> is the best around.</p>
<p>As for storing photos, I use a NAS to store all photos and videos going back a decade, and it automatically backs up any new photos taken from my phone. I then back up this data to another NAS and use an external SSD as a third storage medium. Photo organization is handled by the NAS, and it sorts photos into custom folders categorized by year. If you're looking to get started, I'd suggest getting something like the DiskStation DS224 Plus — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-2-Bay-DiskStation-DS224-Diskless/dp/B0C6927XPX">costs $297</a> and is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QyLFGuapk3FsVNj94smSta" name="plex-media-server.jpg" alt="Plex Media Server logo against RGB lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QyLFGuapk3FsVNj94smSta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it doesn't have to do with digital media, I'd recommend backing up all Google data every two years; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> is a great utility as it bundles all Gmail emails, Drive data, and photos and videos stored in Google Photos in one go. You get to choose which service's data you want to download; I just selected everything, and the size of the download came out to 828GB this year.</p><p>If you're running out of storage in Google Drive and iCloud, both services offer tools to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/quota">see what data is using up storage</a>, and you can delete data accordingly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ultimately, the biggest issue with decluttering is getting started. I had a good handle on my digital media and online activity, but I realized I let physical products pile up, and it was a sizeable undertaking to get them organized and accessible. The best recommendation I can give is to start slow; if you've got a massive photo library or mailbox that needs sorting out, start by doing 20 to 30 photos at a time, and that will allow you to build momentum.</p><p>The same goes for organizing your folders, online accounts, and any digital media. The key is to be consistent, and while I know that may sound hard to do now, it becomes routine — if not enjoyable — once you get a handle on things.</p>

<p>Auditing the way you use the internet is a pain in the butt. But it's worth it for a lot of people; you might be surprised to see all the things you've forgotten about.</p><p>Some important reasons are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/your-online-security-and-privacy-depend-on-more-than-just-googles-work">better privacy and online security</a>, less stress, and maybe even becoming more productive. Less online presence means fewer potential targets for people trying to hijack your identity or get your money, and it reduces the amount of information about you that's online for anyone to see.</p><p>A clutter-free digital life will probably be less stressful and provide fewer distractions, making you a bit more productive overall. You can still have fun, but all the digital trash is gone — it's just like hauling the junk you don't need anymore to the dumpster or recycle bin.</p>
<p>This is something I do every year. I can't say how effective it is at making my life better, but it certainly hasn't caused any issues for me. Here's how I do it.</p><p><strong>Audit your social media. </strong>Have any inactive accounts at places you no longer visit? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-delete-your-twitter-account">Delete them</a>; there's a reason you don't use them, and you aren't going to miss out on anything. For the accounts you use, review your privacy settings, delete any postings you think should be deleted, and purge your friends/following list of anyone who isn't adding value to your life.

<p><strong>Organize your inbox.</strong> Unsubscribe from all the junk mailing lists you've ended up being on, and add a label for the ones you want to keep. Create folders for all the things that are worth reading and read them; never let them sit unread forever. Delete old emails that you'll never need to free up space, and take the time to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-forward-email-your-main-gmail-account-so-google-now-sees-it">create filters</a> to sort out everything as it arrives so you don't have to do it manually every 5,000 messages.</p><p><strong>Secure your accounts.</strong> Go through and change all your passwords and use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">password manager</a> because you're never going to remember them all. Enable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">two-factor authentication</a> for everything that will let you use it — this is the single best thing you can do to keep people out of your digital stuff. While you're at it, try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gmail-spammers-are-winning-the-war-on-your-inbox">learn to be suspicious</a> of any message that asks for any of these passwords or logins. Bank of America isn't going to text you and ask you to fill out a Google form with your account details, but someone who wants to see what's in your bank account might.</p>
<p><strong>Review your privacy settings.</strong> If an app or service has settings under the Privacy or Security label, go through them all and make sure they are set to your liking. This goes for companies like Apple and Google, as well as the company that made your phone or computer. They want to know everything they can about you, so make sure you're only sharing what you <em>want</em> to be sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to limit your digital footprint.</strong> Be cautious about sharing your information, making sure it's worth it for you. You can Google yourself to see what's out there and find examples of why this can matter, and you can always request to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/how-to-remove-your-personal-information-from-results-on-google">have your personal information removed from search results</a>. Something nobody thinks about is product reviews, but they should. Nobody needs to know what brand of underwear you bought from Walmart.com, and you're not getting anything in return for writing a review. Feel free to ignore the emails that beg you to do it.</p>

It plans to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> several months in advance — the current timeline suggests a stable build sometime in Q2 2025, and there will be a second Android release, albeit a minor one. <br><br>The move is in line with Google's efforts to deliver timely features faster, and it is a positive change. Of course, it remains to be seen how other manufacturers adapt; most companies struggle to roll out one update on time (looking at you, Xiaomi and Motorola), so with an accelerated timeline and two releases in 2025, there's no shortage of things to talk about. With Android 16 taking center stage, here's what I want to see in the next version of the OS and predictions for the broader Android ecosystem in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="updates-all-the-time-2">Updates all the time</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C7zTvtoXoCMSCMi5d4u3n3" name="android-15-22.jpg" alt="Android 15 Easter egg on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7zTvtoXoCMSCMi5d4u3n3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">developer preview of Android 16</a> is already available, but it doesn't have any notable new additions yet — that will come with the public betas, which are slated to hit in Q1 2025. Google is moving up the Android release timeline to give other brands the ability to deliver the update to a wider range of devices. With the Pixel launch now pushed to August, it's likely Google wanted the stable build to be available well before that so that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> can have it pre-installed. <br><br>Google says the Android 16 release will have all the major features, and the second release scheduled to be available in Q4 will include stability tweaks and optimizations. Given the wording, I think it's entirely likely we'll go back to point releases, and the second build could be dubbed Android 16.1. <br><br>Now, the big question around the new update timeline is when you'll see it on other devices. Xiaomi doesn't even have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> schedule ready, and while other manufacturers are thankfully doing a better job, it will be until Q1 2025 when most phones released in 2024 switch over to Android 15, including those from Samsung.<br><br>There's no telling when Android 16 will go out to devices other than Pixels, but the manufacturers I talked to said they're setting up the groundwork to have the build rolled out relatively soon after release.</p>
<h2 id="key-interface-changes-again-2">Key interface changes (again)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2aaWbVWSSAFVAmLknuX2y8" name="android-15-volume-panel.jpg" alt="Android 15 volume panel on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aaWbVWSSAFVAmLknuX2y8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I like the oversized tiles that Google introduced with its Material You overhaul in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, not everyone is a fan of the design. In fact, most brands eschewed this design and continued offering regular-sized tiles, with ColorOS meeting Google halfway by using a split scheme that works rather well. With Android 16, Google is once again going back to smaller-sized tiles, and that should be welcome news if you're using a Pixel. <br><br>Foldables are no longer a niche, and Google rolled out meaningful changes in Android 15 aimed at these devices. That said, I want Google to offer better multitasking in Android 16. OnePlus is the best at this, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">Open foldable</a> has a freeform multitasking mode that's a delight to use. Google needs to roll out something similar in Android 16.</p>
<h2 id="ai-everywhere-2">AI everywhere</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dspAcxjMLyPU3aUAne7MWW" name="google-pixel-9-pixel-weather-app-03.jpg" alt="Exploring the new Pixel Weather app on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL including AI summary and the new widget view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dspAcxjMLyPU3aUAne7MWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't really see the point of AI, but I will admit that Google does a great job rolling out AI features that are actually useful. The best part is that the brand is collaborating with other manufacturers to make these features accessible on a wider range of phones, and that's a good thing. <br><br>As such, it will be interesting to see how Honor and Samsung integrate Google's suite of AI tools into their devices in 2025. Both brands are leaning heavily into AI to differentiate their software, and with the Magic 7 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> slated to launch soon, we don't need to wait long to see what new AI features are onboard.</p>
<h2 id="android-and-chromeos-together-2">Android and ChromeOS together</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-26.jpg" alt="Black Myth Wukong via NVIDIA GeForce Now on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm yet to use a Chromebook, and while I'm not the target audience for these devices — I use a custom Windows machine with an RTX 4090 — there's clearly a sizeable demand, and it is interesting to see Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report">slowly merging ChromeOS into Android</a>. I think this is a positive move as it allows for tighter integration between the two platforms.</p>
<h2 id="android-xr-2">Android XR</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hhYsUHQUEi6pmBmLM9hunL" name="Android-XR-Graphic" alt="An Android XR graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhYsUHQUEi6pmBmLM9hunL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is teaming up with Samsung and Qualcomm to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR</a>, a new OS built for extended reality headsets and glasses. We'll get an initial taste of the hardware in 2025 by way of Samsung's Project Moohan, but other brands should start rolling out their own products later in the year. <br><br>Android XR brings YouTube, Google TV, Google Maps, Google Photos, Gemini, and Chrome to XR devices, and a consistent interface is the inflection point needed to take these devices mainstream. Having used a few headsets in the past, the limiting factor continues to be the software, and if Google is able to deliver a fluid interface with access to its best utilities, we could see this category flourishing in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A jury sided with Qualcomm in a key legal battle over the company's custom Oryon CPU cores, which power Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite.</li><li>Arm said in a statement that it plans to seek a retrial following the jury's deadlocked verdict.</li><li>The decision means that Qualcomm can continue to sell products with processors designed using Nuvia tech.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Arm's lawsuit against Qualcomm over the chipmaker's custom CPU cores ended in a mistrial Friday, Dec. 20, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-jury-deadlocked-arm-trial-193123626.html" target="_blank">Reuters</a> first reported. The mistrial verdict leaves some uncertainty around Arm's grievances with Qualcomm, and Arm said in a statement it planned to seek a retrial. However, a jury decided that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> had a valid license for its Nuvia cores — a central issue of the dispute between the two companies.</p><p>The trial ended in a mistrial because the jury couldn't unanimously agree on whether or not Nuvia breached its agreement with Arm. However, the judge presiding over the case cautioned the two companies about seeking a retrial.</p><p>"I don't think either side had a clear victory or would have had a clear victory if this case is tried again," said U.S. Judge Maryellen Noreika in the courtroom, as reported by Reuters.</p><p>The judge encouraged the two companies to resolve their dispute privately rather than seek another lawsuit, as Judge Noreika seemed convinced that a new trial would lead to the same uncertain result. However, in a statement to Android Central, Arm said it plans to seek a retrial.</p><p>“We are disappointed that the jury was unable to reach consensus across the claims. We intend to seek a retrial due to the jury’s deadlock," an Arm spokesperson told Android Central in an email. "From the outset, our top priority has been to protect Arm’s IP and the unparalleled ecosystem we have built with our valued partners over more than 30 years. As always, we are committed to fostering innovation in our rapidly evolving market and serving our partners while advancing the future of computing.”</p><p>Qualcomm, for one, is satisfied by the jury's decision and the trial's conclusion.</p><p>“We are pleased with today’s decision. The jury has vindicated Qualcomm’s right to innovate and affirmed that all the Qualcomm products at issue in the case are protected by Qualcomm’s contract with Arm," said Ann Chaplin, Qualcomm's general counsel, in a statement emailed to Android Central. "We will continue to develop performance-leading, world class products that benefit consumers worldwide, with our incredible Oryon ARM-compliant custom CPUs.”</p><p>Arm sued Qualcomm two years ago when the two companies disagreed about what royalties were owed to Arm for Qualcomm's use of custom CPU designs. Things were complicated by Qualcomm's purchase of startup chip designer Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021. The issue concerned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-pulling-the-plug-on-qualcomms-chip-design-license">whether Qualcomm had valid licenses to the Arm designs originally licensed to Nuvia</a> before the acquisition. These designs led to the creation of Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, which powered Snapdragon X Elite, and later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>Matters became more serious over the summer, when Arm said it wanted all Snapdragon X laptops "destroyed." <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/arm-is-giving-qualcomm-the-wake-up-call-it-needs">Money and royalties were at the heart of the disagreement</a>, since court documents viewed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/arm-qualcomm-trial-set-begin-over-chip-contract-dispute-2024-12-16/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> revealed that Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia could've cost Arm $50 million in lost revenue.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung kicked off a test today (Dec 20) via the "Display Assistant beta" app through its Galaxy Lab test environment.</li><li>The app delivers several display options that let users take complete control of its adaptive brightness, refresh rate, and more.</li><li>Samsung gave its testers a jolly second One UI 7 beta, which delivered a host of fixes for errors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As Samsung works on its next major OS, a new app test grants users more control of their Galaxy phone's display.</p><p>Known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1869983923079655911?s=31">Ice Universe</a> noticed a new app wrapped in Samsung's Galaxy Labs test environment called "Display Assistant beta" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-display-assistant-app-control-display-settings-per-app/">SamMobile</a>). At first glance, it seems the app will give users total control of their device's display to dictate its behavior for every app. The test brings several features users can experiment with, like "brightness limit profile."</p><p>This gives users two choices: standard and light. When selected, the former will cut down your brightness when your device reaches higher temperatures. The latter will keep your brightness as is; however, your Galaxy device will cool down slower.</p><p>There's also a "standard refresh rate" option. According to the publication, any apps placed in there will be restricted to "60Hz per second to save power."</p><p>The tipster on X highlighted several more key features of the Display Assistant beta, such as "Curtain mode," "One click screen on for 30 minutes," and the ability to control the adaptive brightness of your Galaxy device. The in-app description states adaptive brightness will alter the display based on the user's surroundings.</p><p>However, with it set at 2x speed, users can slide the bubble along the slider down to 1x or double it to 4x.</p>

<p>In short, several of these features can affect your Galaxy phone's power as altering its brightness or limiting the refresh rate can take the stress off its battery. Samsung just launched this Display Assistant beta via Galaxy Labs; however, it is limited to One UI 7 (specifically v7.0.12). Those in the OS beta can likely grab this and start experimenting.</p><p>Speaking of One UI 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-2-galaxy-s24-rollout">the second beta</a> just kicked off for enrolled testers in the program. We spotted the beta rolling onto the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which involves the other S24 devices in the series. Enrolled testers will find a 1GB download packed with bug fixes for several One UI errors and malfunctions. The Now Bar was among the areas of One UI getting fixed as users reported a "continuous" display error.</p><p>Additionally, the Korean OEM detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">what to expect</a> with One UI 7 once it launches. Samsung intends for its Now Bar to be a useful, curated app assistant right on your lock screen. The upcoming software is also working on a "Personal Data Engine," which should help users utilize its on-device AI with better privacy and security.</p>
