<ul><li>Google's July update for Gemini is packed with a brand new model and an expansion to its access.</li><li>Gemini's 1.5 Flash model, previously teased during I/O 2024 brings swifter responses and the ability for it to understand more complex questions.</li><li>Gemini in Messages expands to more countries while Google prepares to introduce the world of AI to teen users in August.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With July winding down, Google is highlighting an update to Gemini that quickens its response time and extends it to more places.</p><p>As noted in a press release, Gemini&apos;s latest updates kick off with the debut of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">1.5 Flash model</a>. Google states this version of Gemini has been "optimized for speed and efficiency" as the AI can respond to your queries faster. The model has also been granted a 4x large context window, which helps Gemini understand, process, and answer your complex questions more easily.</p><p>The 1.5 Flash model is picking up a Gemini Advanced feature, which lets users upload files to the AI via their Drive or from their devices.</p><p>Gemini&apos;s fastest model is rolling out on the web and Android today (July 25). Users can find the AI available in 40 languages across 230 places.</p>

<p>Google also announced that Gemini is on the way to more places and people following today&apos;s updates. To start, the AI model is making its debut in Messages in the European Economic Area (EEA), the U.K., and Switzerland. New languages are also receiving support, with Google stating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-text-gemini-in-google-messages">Gemini in Messages</a> now supports French, Polish, and Spanish.</p><p>The main Gemini Android app is also rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/14579026?visit_id=638574456988887950-2640642685&p=gemini_app_location&rd=1">in more countries</a>. The other side of this is Google&apos;s expansion of its model to teen users. Those who meet the minimum age requirement (13) can begin accessing Gemini for help regarding homework, paper writing, and more.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-for-students-educator-features-detailed">recently previewed this expansion</a>, stating Gemini would also enter the school system to aid teachers and students alike. Google stated that it had implored guardrails to ensure that young users aren&apos;t exposed to inappropriate content when asking questions. Gemini for teens is set to arrive "in the coming week" in August.</p>

<p>Lastly, Google is bolstering the ability for users to fact-check Gemini. Arriving for English prompts first, Gemini chats will now display an arrow icon beside certain responses. The post adds that clicking or tapping on this chip will expand the response, showcasing where Gemini got its (hyperlinked) information from.</p><p>These links will display the website&apos;s icon (if available), the title of the article, and the website&apos;s URL. Moreover, if Gemini pulls any information from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=how%20to%20control-,Gemini%20Extensions,-to%20other%20Google">your connected extensions</a>, you&apos;ll see those listed alongside any relevant links.</p><p>Users will be familiar with this style of fact-checking as Google Search&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">AI Overviews</a> feature them. During a response, Search will display its collected assortment of information relevant to your question. However, expanding the box will showcase any relevant links to the source material.</p><p>This final update is rolling out today on Gemini.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon detailed several changes on the way for Prime Video viewers in "the coming weeks."</li><li>Prime Video is set to pick up a navigation bar with pre-made options, a new "Prime" choice, and add-on subscriptions from other services for easier access.</li><li>Amazon is also revamping how recommended content is understood and displayed for users browsing different categories and topics.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amazon has prepared a host of updates for its Prime Video service, one of which is a UI upgrade that users will immediately notice.</p><p>The company detailed what&apos;s next for Prime Video in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience">a blog post</a>, starting with a "content-forward" navigation bar. The bar is placed at the top of your display and features the following pre-made options: Home, Movies, TV Shows, Sports, and Live TV. Amazon states users will notice a "Prime" option, which is packed with content available to you "at no extra cost."</p><p>Active add-on subscriptions to other services like Crunchyroll or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a> will appear beside the Prime option for easier access. As such, what you were previously watching or what&apos;s recommended will appear as the hero image below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:711px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.84%;"><img id="8THgpxDoYH4pMZ5WuQfe9j" name="amazon-prime-video-new-ui-add-on-content.jpg" alt="Amazon's Prime Video UI updates displays add-on subscriptions in the top nav bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8THgpxDoYH4pMZ5WuQfe9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="711" height="397" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recommendations viewers will see have been given a heavier personal touch based on your interests and history. Amazon states that it now takes advantage of Generative AI to help users find "content that&apos;s relevant." Users browsing the "Made for You" section for movies and shows will notice simplification as Prime Video categorizes content based on your interests.</p><p>Additionally, users can find new content with the "Top 10 in the U.S." and "Trending Shows" categories in Prime Video. Movie and show descriptions have also become more concise due to Amazon leveraging LLMs (large language models).</p><p>Some smaller refinements to Prime Video enter by way of smoother animations. TVs are preparing to receive an auto-playing hero rotator. Amazon states this is designed to give users an "immersive experience" when trying to pick a show or movie to watch. Hopping into Live TV will play recommended 24/7 stations until users pick a station or leave the tab.</p><p>Amazon adds that these updates have considered its older streaming devices alongside the latest models to ensure a seamless experience. The post informs users that the updated UI will begin appearing "in the coming weeks."</p><p>The updates to Amazon Prime Video come a couple of months after the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-prime-video-interactive-ads">introduced interactive ads</a>. The goal is to aid users in shopping while watching shows as the ads will appear as 15 to 30-second breaks. Moreover, these interact ads will appear whenever a viewer pauses their content with details about the brand to help shoppers make an informed decision.</p>

<p>After teaming up with NBCUniversal for the Olympic Games in Paris, Google is bringing its AI smarts to the 2024 Olympics, introducing fresh ways for fans to connect with the action.</p><p>Google recently partnered with Team USA as the "Official Search AI Partner," which is a huge deal.

<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly ramping up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> production as early market signals show the smart ring is surpassing expectations.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4920" target="_blank">The Elec</a>, Samsung originally planned to produce 400,000 Galaxy Rings. However, due to unexpected demand, it has increased that number by 600,000 units.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s July Unpacked event was a big deal, packed with game-changing innovations. Among other devices launched during the show, the Galaxy Ring stole the limelight, catching everyone&apos;s eye since its debut. Even though it was teased earlier this year, Samsung kept the specs and launch date a secret until the much-awaited July reveal.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring blew past all expectations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-cant-ship-the-galaxy-ring-fast-enough-shows-how-theyre-an-in-thing">selling out in the preorder phase</a>. It&apos;s clear that demand for Samsung&apos;s new wearable technology is way higher than initially thought.</p><p>Now, industry insiders say Samsung has told suppliers to boost Galaxy Ring production by 150% due to huge consumer interest. If true, the South Korean tech giant could ship over a million units by year-end, as per The Elec.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finnish wearable company Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405006108/en/On-the-Heels-of-1-Million-Rings-Sold-Oura-Now-Valued-at-2.55-Billion" target="_blank">surpassed 2.5 million units for its smart ring in 2022</a>. While impressive, it took the company seven years to reach its first million.</p><p>Oura pioneered the smart ring category nearly a decade ago, keeping it a niche market. But with Samsung now entering the scene, this technology could go mainstream.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring stands out from other smart rings by offering no subscription fees, a battery life of up to a week, and personalized recommendations and insights powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>Priced at $399, the smart ring is now available in the U.S. But with stock running low and delivery dates pushing into late August, buyers should act fast to secure their size.</p><p>Despite Samsung&apos;s push to speed up production and meet the high demand for the Galaxy Ring, consumers might still face stock shortages in the short term as the company tries to restock.</p>

I&apos;ve now worn all four generations of these watches, and this is my third year reviewing the "regular" version of the Galaxy Watch du jour, which means it’s another year of playing Spot the Difference on expert mode.</p><p>On a spec sheet or a listing page, it&apos;s hard to see what justifies the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>&apos;s existence outside Samsung needing its upgrade. Even while taking the watch out and setting it up, it feels like a re-run, but wear it for a week, and you&apos;ll notice something wonderful. Or rather, you&apos;ll <em>not</em> notice something wonderful. </p><p>What you&apos;ll notice instead is a combination of gimmicky AI-powered health metrics and new gesture controls that aren&apos;t actually new but are nonetheless fun.

<p>Samsung released the Galaxy Watch 7 on July 24, 2024 in two sizes: a $300 40mm model that comes in Cream (white gold) and Green (somewhere between Hunter Green and Moss Green) and a $330 44mm model available in Green and Silver. LTE models of the Galaxy Watch 7 are available for $350 (40mm) and $380 (44mm).</p><p>All sizes come with the Sport band that matches the color of the watch&apos;s housing, with a small blue accent on the left side and orange on the right. The 40mm comes with a S/M by default and the 44mm comes with a M/L by default, but if you buy the watch through Samsung, you have the option to customize it to a different band size/color.</p>

That's the curse of watch bands sculpted to perfectly mesh with the watch's main housing. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 uses the exact same 1.3 and 1.5-inch 2,000-nit touchscreens as the Galaxy Watch 6, and it&apos;s just as bright, crisp, and perfectly easy to read in direct sunlight. After three years of wearing 40mm Galaxy Watches, the 44mm&apos;s screen has been a welcome little upgrade. It won&apos;t display more elements, but they become much easier to glance at, even the thin complications on a watch face, and the $30 upgrade to 44mm seems much more justifiable if it fits your wrist. </p><p>Sadly, my wrist is smaller than the lug-to-lug span of the 44mm Watch 7, so I needed watch bands that could immediately bend back to keep the watch securely in place on my arm. This made me unable to test the sculpted-at-the-lugs Sport band of the watch fully, but it&apos;s grippy without being sticky, and the notches help the band avoid slipping around your sweaty wrist in this miserable summer heat. </p>

<p>The blue-orange accents pop without being tacky, though I wish they were different colors for each colorway — and that the Watch 7&apos;s home button had a different rim color. The orange stands out better against the Watch 7&apos;s colorways compared to the red seen on previous watches, but orange doesn&apos;t go with everything as well as Samsung thinks. </p><p>Outside the new band styles, the only exterior difference to the Galaxy Watch 7 is the new BIA health sensor array. The dome of the array curves higher, making the watch sit higher on lanky wrists like mine, but for thicker wrists, you shouldn&apos;t notice much of a difference. We&apos;ll get into the improvements of the new sensors in a bit, but I do very much like the look of the dome and the new HR sensors. Not that you&apos;ll be looking at the bottom of your watch all that often, but the eight dots white feel cleaner than the grey, partially-clipped ring on previous generations.</p>

Most of the changes Wear OS 5 is bringing are under-the-hood, require updates from app developers, or both, but the most important feature on the Watch 7 isn&apos;t exclusive to the new OS; it&apos;s the expansion and surfacing of the Accessibility-based gesture controls with double-pinch and knock-knock shortcuts.</p><p>Double-pinch gestures are built into many apps and system tools, allowing you to quickly silence timers, turn off alarms, play/pause music, pause/restart workouts, and dismiss notifications. When two watch functions that can use double-pinch are open at the same time, it pops up a window to choose which one you wanted, but that takes away the point of doing it one-handed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6upDrr4Qwzx77v3JaPGHBa" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-pinch-gesture-popup.jpg" alt="A pop-up menu on the Galaxy Watch 7 when double pinch has two available commands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6upDrr4Qwzx77v3JaPGHBa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The knock-on shortcut hasn&apos;t gotten the play that the "zOMG, they copied the Apple Watch" pinch gestures, and it can admittedly do fewer things. It&apos;s just a shortcut, be it to your favorite app, workout style, or the flashlight. Yeah, I forget these watches have a flashlight, too, half the time, but boy, howdy does it come in handy. Granted, you have to twist your wrist up like some Power Ranger or Ben 10 wannabe to have it shine in front of you rather than to the side or straight up, but it&apos;s a hands-free flashlight without any verbal commands. The screen has to already be on, but that&apos;s what tilt-to-wake is for.</p><p>It&apos;s been great when it works, but admittedly it misses my pinches and knocks about 30% of the time. Whether that&apos;s a failure in the detection software, an issue stemming from how bony and thin my wrist is, or user error remains to be seen, but at most, I can suffer 3-5 seconds of pinching at midair like a shadow puppeteer to shut my watch up while I&apos;m carrying something or typing away like a madwoman.</p><p>Samsung proclaimed the Exynos W1000 as almost 3x faster than the Galaxy Watch 6, but I&apos;m not seeing it. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is the zippiest smartwatch I&apos;ve ever used, but it&apos;s not magnitudes faster, at least during everyday activities. That extra speed likely comes in handy more during offline GPS-tracked workouts and other intensive workout styles, but in the day-to-day, it&apos;s faster, but not noticeably.  </p>

<p>A new generation of Galaxy Watch means new watch faces, and Samsung&apos;s new Ultra Info Board watch face allows us a peek into the future of Wear OS 5&apos;s Flavors. Flavors allow developers to make presets within their watch faces with different styles and even different preset complications. Among the various flavors of the Ultra Info Board, we have swimming, hiking, and running alongside the overall health version. I&apos;m hoping Samsung will allow us to save personally edited Flavors among the presets one day, but it&apos;s a useful little expansion with huge implications for watch face developers. </p><p>The other two new watch faces are… okay? Simple Digital is a little too simple, in my opinion, and while Spatial Number is definitely distinctive, it feels awkward to have a balloon-ish numeral for the hour, analog hands for hours and minutes, and then a background gradient sweeper for seconds. Pick a lane, Samsung.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-heart-rate-range.jpg" alt="Daily rate rate ranges on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWnsNiFHb4PY4SbwxWeqEa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The highlight of the Watch 7&apos;s hardware upgrades its new health sensor array, multiplying the LEDs that track heart rate and blood oxygen to help improve tracking accuracy during high-intensity workouts. The readings feel more responsive than previous generations, but I&apos;ve had fewer workouts so far than previous watches because the same day my Watch 7 arrived, COVID symptoms began to flood my sinuses and suck out my energy like a cartoon vampire.</p><p>The beauty of being exhausted from the moment you wake up is you get to really work out the sleep tracking and the new Galaxy AI-powered Energy score. The sleep coaching has been very hands-off this time around, but the tracking itself has been quite good. Blood oxygen readings have way fewer holes in them than on my Watch 6, and both the temperature and heart rate charts are less prone to sudden dropouts or spikes. </p><p>Sleep tracking on the Watch 7 includes your average respiratory rate, even if you don&apos;t have the fancy sleep apnea testing running from Samsung Health Monitor. Yes, the sleep apnea tracking is exclusive to Samsung Galaxy phones, just like the electrocardiogram ECG readings have been since the Galaxy Watch 4 days. Yes, I&apos;m still mad about it; if you pay $300 for a watch that advertises sleep apnea tracking or irregular heartbeat detection, you shouldn&apos;t have to spend another $300-$1300 on a Galaxy phone to actually use it. </p>

<p>Although it&apos;s not specific to the watch, I&apos;m grateful for Samsung&apos;s Medications minder. You can scan the bottles to put each type in the list rather than having to type out the name — though most of my prescription meds were easy enough to find via autocomplete — set reminders for meds at certain times of day, and even look at possible drug interactions you might not have known about. </p><p>Look forward to more in this space as I finish my COVID recovery and fully put the workout tracking — and the new dual-band GPS — of the Watch 7 through its paces. So far, though, it and Samsung Health work quite well without always throwing themselves in my face like some other watches do. And Samsung remains one of the only smart watches that doesn&apos;t eventually need a fitness subscription.</p>

<p>Battery life varies widely on a smartwatch — especially once you take it outside or undertake any lengthy workouts — so here were my testing factors. This is my first 44mm Galaxy Watch — my 4, 5, and 6 were all 40mm to better fit my small wrist — and I switched off between two watch faces: the new Ultra Info Board watch face with a static background) and Photos with animated gif backgrounds. Google Assistant was turned on but hotword detection was not enabled.</p><p>While the performance upgrade of the Exynos W1000 seemed negligible, its improved efficiency helps the batter shine despite being the same size as its predecessor. With AOD (always-on display) disabled, continuous HR tracking, and overnight sleep tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 lasted two days on my wrist before needing a charger on days I did not work out. On outdoor-heavy days and when I could manage a light workout, the battery life dropped to 33-36 hours.</p><p>Overall, battery life is a bit better, but the charging experience suffers from the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s only design change. The new heart rate sensor and curvature of the health sensor array push the charging coils just a few millimeters further away when it sits on a flat charging pad — namely, a Galaxy S smartphone with reverse wireless charging like the Galaxy S24 Ultra — breaking the best backup charger a smartwatch could ask for. </p>

<p>Samsung calls it Wireless PowerShare; you&apos;d turn it on, set your phone down face-down, and set your Galaxy Watch on top of it face-up. Provided your watch band wasn&apos;t too inflexibly curved, the watch could then recharge itself off your phone&apos;s battery, giving you enough juice to last a few more hours until you get home. This is no longer an option, meaning that if you lose or break your charger, you&apos;ll have to go buy another charging puck. This isn&apos;t the end of the world by any means, but it&apos;s a small bummer worth mentioning for the forgetful folks out there who might&apos;ve relied on this feature.</p><p>Also, if you have a cutesy little stand that your current Galaxy Watch charger is settled into, it might not quite sit properly with the Galaxy Watch 7&apos;s charger and its deeper profile. (Farewell, sweet TPU camera stand; I&apos;ll miss you.) I have confirmed that the Watch 7 will charge on the Watch 6 charger, though, so at least you can keep your old one if you upgrade.</p><p>Although, if you own a Galaxy Watch 6, there&apos;s no real reason to do that.</p>

<p>The biggest obstacle for Samsung&apos;s newest watch isn&apos;t the hardware or the software: it&apos;s the utter lack of reason to upgrade to it. If you&apos;re still rocking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, then yes, your time has come — assuming your battery even held out this long — but even the jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> to 7 seems superfluous unless you&apos;ve had poor results with the ECG or heart rate sensor on it. Even then, the ECG readings are only marginally improved, at least for my fingers and heart or just have to have a 2,000 nit screen instead of a 2,000 mAh one. </p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, the only real change is the heart rate sensor, and that sensor array is a double-edged sword: it improves heart rate tracking, especially during workouts, but it also makes the watch thicker, sitting slightly higher on your wrist. Wear OS 5 should be arriving on the Galaxy Watch 6 in weeks, so just sit tight, save your money, and maybe buy a new watch band instead to make it feel new.</p><p>There&apos;s also the $200 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-vs-galaxy-watch-fe">Galaxy Watch FE</a> if you&apos;re looking for almost the same features for two-thirds of the price. However, you&apos;ll still be stuck with the older processor and chunkier bezels on the screen. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-bay-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFx9dLkFoZVkqNrNZqeuz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 at $300/$330 and this high build quality and software consistency help it easily hold its own against most current Wear OS watches on the market. Granted, the Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> still looks slightly prettier with the recessed bands and the rounded design, but those bands are proprietary, it&apos;s more expensive, and after six months, you&apos;ll need to pay for Fitbit Premium for a number of the fitness metrics. </p><p>I&apos;ll need time to fully test the workout and GPS tracking with the Watch 7 before claiming it a Garmin-killer, but Samsung&apos;s more focused on smarts while Garmin&apos;s 100% focused on fitness, so that decision is going to come down to how well you can live without Samsung or Google&apos;s apps and services on your watch.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-should-you-buy-one"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 review: Should you buy one?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy the Galaxy Watch 7 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are new to smartwatches and want the most consistent experience without being forced into a subscription.</li><li>You've had issues with past Galaxy Watches not tracking you properly and are ready to give it another try.</li><li>You're already invested in Google and/or Samsung's ecosystem and want a watch that integrates with them.</li><li>You want a smartwatch that doesn't require a subscription.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Galaxy Watch 7 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You already own a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 or 6.</li><li>You absolutely, positively have to have all the bells and whistles of the latest model. (If you do, you'll want to go look at the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.)</li><li>You prefer a more flashy or weighty watch on your wrist.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung&apos;s insistence on Galaxy AI&apos;s greatness and trendy features hides the core tracking and performance boost given by Wear OS 5, a new processor, and the upgraded health sensors. And I&apos;m okay with Samsung focusing on the tangible here, especially when the proof of these upgrades is not having lag or tracking inaccuracies. After all, if Samsung&apos;s done its job right, you&apos;ll think Samsung hasn&apos;t done anything at all and that the Galaxy Watch has always been this smooth and stable.</p><p>When this mix of flashy and understated adds up to a snappy smartwatch with a bright screen, the decked-out feature toolbox of One UI 6 Watch, and almost 2 days of battery life, it&apos;s easy to recommend the Galaxy Watch 7 to new smartwatch buyers and older ones looking to get back in the game. We may not have the fancy new watch band system or overhauled design that the Galaxy Watch Ultra does, but it&apos;s half the price and half the weight. (And it still uses standard 20mm bands, so you&apos;re not stuck with expensive, proprietary watch bands.)</p><p>I&apos;d heavily suggest trading in an old smartwatch to knock the price for however long Samsung is offering "any smartwatch, any condition" $100 trade-in, which makes this a $200 watch and a no-brainer upgrade for anyone who can dig that old LG Watch or Pebble out of your junk drawer. But even if you have to buy at list price, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 earns its keep better than any other sub-$500 watch on the Android stage. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="how-many-software-updates-will-the-oneplus-nord-4-receive-2">How many software updates will the OnePlus Nord 4 receive?</h2>
<p>OnePlus has confirmed that it will deliver four guaranteed Android OS updates and six years of security updates to the Nord 4. As the device launched with Android 14, it will be eligible to be upgraded to Android 18 once it becomes available in 2028. Additionally, with six years of software updates, the phone will receive security patches until 2030 — making it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phone</a> currently available in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="the-nord-4-will-get-more-software-updates-than-any-other-oneplus-phone-2">The Nord 4 will get more software updates than any other OnePlus phone</h2>
<p>OnePlus is switching up its strategy with the Nord 4, with the device getting six years of security updates. That&apos;s longer than the five-year guarantee of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, and it&apos;s interesting that the manufacturer is announcing the change on a mid-range phone instead of a flagship.</p><p>What this means is that the Nord 4 will get software updates until July 2030, and that&apos;s incredible. It allows OnePlus to go up squarely against the likes of the Galaxy A55 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> in this segment, and while Google&apos;s mid-ranger is still in the lead as it will get seven Android updates, this is a terrific starting point.</p><p>My only quibble with OnePlus is that the company doesn&apos;t roll out updates on time; sure, platform updates for flagships show up within a few months, but Nord devices haven&apos;t gotten the same level of attention in the past, and that needs to change. Thankfully, that might be the case with the Nord 4, and I will update this post with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> availability as and when the next version rolls out to the device.</p><p>Otherwise, the software situation on the Nord 4 is identical to that of the OnePlus 12 — both phones have the same UI and feature-set. It is just as fluidic in daily use, and while it doesn&apos;t quite handle demanding games as well, it comes close.</p><p>Overall, the fact that OnePlus will deliver four guaranteed Android updates alongside six years of security patches gives the Nord 4 a distinct edge over most phones in the mid-range segment.</p>

<ul><li>Meta AI is starting to roll out a new feature that plays off a user's selfie called "Imagine Me."</li><li>The feature requires three selfies of a user (from various angles) to then recreate them as a gladiator, on the moon, or as a flying space ranger.</li><li>Meta teased in a blog post that an "Edit with AI" button is on the way to bring users more creative agency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta has a fun feature on the way for its array of platforms that&apos;ll transform users into new versions of themselves thanks to AI.</p><p>Meta AI continues to advance and the company&apos;s CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xxBFYyF2X/?igsh=bGt0aG13MDF4YjJz">took to Instagram</a> to show off "Imagine Me." When messaging Meta AI on the platform, users can turn themselves into whatever they want by starting their prompt with "Imagine me" followed by a gladiator, football player, or whatever.</p><p>The short video shows that users can initiate an "Imagine Me" session but the AI will prompt them to take a few selfies. Users need to take three: one straight on, one from the right, and one from the left.</p><p>After, they can re-ask the AI to imagine them as a fictional or non-fictional person and see what it returns.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/meta-ai-is-now-multilingual-more-creative-and-smarter/">a blog post</a>, Meta explained that users will have some creative agency when asking the AI to imagine them as a DJ. The company states that if something isn&apos;t right after delivering a prompt, users can type "change" followed by the object or items they&apos;d like to be different.</p><p>Meta states that "next month," users will gain an "Edit with AI" button when texting with its software. The post doesn&apos;t explain what all the edit section will entail, but hopefully, filters, cropping, and more will be involved.</p>

<p>Users eager to get their hands on "Imagine Me" can begin doing so this week as Meta starts rolling it out. The company adds that folks can create an image of themselves directly in their feed, stories, comments, and Messages found on Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger.</p><p>It was first discovered that WhatsApp would be receiving this feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves">earlier this month</a>, with the ability to pull up the feature in other chats. The app&apos;s code highlighted the user&apos;s ability to type "@Meta imagine me" in another chat with a fellow user to show yourself off walking on the moon thanks to AI. What&apos;s more, it seems that more companies are getting in on the idea of reimagination <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/another-ai-packed-feature-could-be-on-the-way-for-youtube-shorts">such as YouTube</a>.</p><p>It seems Google is experimenting with an AI feature for YouTube Shorts that would let users simulate an AI-based green screen behind them while recording. "Dream Screen" would enable creators to make it seem like they&apos;re on top of a mountain or in the depths of the most beautiful ocean.</p>

<p>The wait is over: Samsung&apos;s newest lineup of foldable phones has landed and I&apos;ve done the work of gathering all of the best Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals so you don&apos;t have to. Whether you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity, straight discount, or you simply have a question about the innovative foldable, everything you need to know about buying the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 can be found in this guide.</p><p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">our recently-published initial review</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 boasts the power of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, two gorgeous 120Hz displays, and one of the best folding hinges ever built into a smartphone. The problem is that the phone also starts at a whopping $1,899.99 for the 256GB version, which is why the following deals are so important. </p><p>A lot of these offers are holdovers from the Z Fold 6&apos;s preorder period, so we don&apos;t know how long they&apos;re going to last. In other words, don&apos;t wait too long if a deal catches your eye or you might end up paying full price on a super price-y smartphone. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">What are the specs of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a refinement of nearly everything that made its predecessor such a groundbreaking device. The foldable phone is thinner, lighter, and, well, more foldable than the Z Fold 5, thanks to its newly-designed "dual rail" hinge structure. You also get a performance boost thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (the same chipset that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-and-availability">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>), a brighter display, and seven years of OS updates straight out of the box. </p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cost?</h2>
<p>The biggest issue that we have with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its price. With a starting price of $1,899.99, the upcoming foldable is $100 more expensive than the already-very-expensive Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, and you&apos;re not even getting new camera technology or improved battery life out of the deal. So considering the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs the Z Fold 5, is the new phone worth the upgrade? </p><p>That&apos;s ultimately your call, but hopefully the preorder deals above can soften any financial blow if you decide to buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>The supposed design for the upcoming Pixel Buds Pro 2 has leaked, which teases slight changes for the buds.</p><p>It seems phone accessory/case maker Spigen jumped the gun as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixelbuds/comments/1eaz8zt/pixel_buds_pro_2_design_leak/">a user on Reddit</a> discovered an ad for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). The Amazon ad a brief look at the Buds themselves, which appear to be slightly bigger than the O.G. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Buds Pro</a>. The device keeps its smooth surface for user touch controls, however, that top portion looks taller while the buds seem closer together in the case.</p><p>Another slight change is with the grills that the Pro edition features. Both instances of it are now colored the same as the Buds instead of retaining a black hue like before.</p><p>The slightly taller Buds make one wonder if there&apos;s a hardware reason behind it, like audio/battery upgrades.</p><p>The early glimpse gives us a look at a curious addition to the bottom of the Buds Pro 2 case — a new cutout. This appears quite important as Spigen&apos;s ad highlights "cutouts for easy pairing and sharing." The publication theorizes it could be a small speaker for users trying to relocate the device using Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">Find My Device network</a>.</p><p>For now, its purpose remains unclear. The case doesn&apos;t appear radically different from the previous generation as it still sports an egg-like shape in all white.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, more information is surfacing regarding Google&apos;s next earbuds following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-summer-vibe-colors-leak">recent color leak</a>. The Buds in Spigen&apos;s ad feature a "Raspberry" hue, which was rumored alongside Porcelain, Haze, and a summer-vibe Mojito. There&apos;s a chance that some of these color choices are done to match the Pixel 9 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">which we&apos;ve also seen</a> previously.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Buds Pro 2 was reportedly spotted snagging its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-spotted">battery certification</a> for the case. The listing showcased the case&apos;s 650mAh battery, which is a 30mAh increase over what the original iteration offers. But luckily we&apos;re not too far from knowing all the details as Google is preparing for an earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-event-2024-date-announced">hardware event</a> on August 13.</p>
