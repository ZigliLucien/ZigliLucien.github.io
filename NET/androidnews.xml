But the trend-setters continue to be the ones at the top; the ones that set benchmarks for how we interpret just how good such a feature could be.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds fit that mold, even if they first came to market in 2023. If dampening background noise is a big deal for you, these are worth serious consideration as the best in the business.</p>

<p>Bose <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-headphones-earbuds-launch">launched</a> the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in September 2023 and they should be easy to find in retail or online. It&apos;s unlikely Bose will release a succeeding pair to these until more time has passed, so expect these to be the company&apos;s flagship earbuds for a while yet. They start out at $299, but look for the odd discount when it happens, rare as it may be. They&apos;re available in Black or White Smoke.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-what-s-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-wearing.jpg" alt="Side view wearing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XbngowG9aYbGAoEhg4yueL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From a design standpoint, the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-ii-review">QuietComfort Earbuds II</a> clearly influence what this pair looks like. They won&apos;t be the smallest you&apos;ll find but improved comfort and stability mean they&apos;re not likely to fall out, either. I&apos;m pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up while riding my bike, and Bose helps by finding the best fit for your ears when going through the test in the Bose Music app.</p><p>A tighter seal is crucial to getting the best noise-cancelation and sound quality, so it may take a little trial and error to figure out what&apos;s best for you. Mind you, these have the same 9.3mm drivers as the QuietComfort Earbuds II, though in going through the app&apos;s hearing test, Bose&apos;s CustomTune software adjusts the sound and noise-canceling to work best with your ear canals.</p><p>You don&apos;t have to go through the hearing test but you also can&apos;t opt out of CustomTune. It works either way doing its best to tune things, and another reason for that is to manage spatial audio, or Immersive Audio, as Bose calls it. Much of the rest of the internal components otherwise change from before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-1.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize fit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjHjacg2hAFD9zwoftDXJL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, Bose gives some attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> codecs, making the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feel more like the premium buds they&apos;re supposed to be. They support Snapdragon Sound, which includes aptX Adaptive to play hi-res tracks from sources offering them. That, plus Bluetooth 5.3, enable lower-latency playback as well, making these easier to trust when watching a show or movie.</p><p>AptX Adaptive isn&apos;t quite as good as aptX Lossless but you won&apos;t notice anyway unless you always prefer to listen to tunes at the highest bit rates. Despite that, I&apos;ll give Bose credit for a solid default sound signature. Fully expecting to have to go to the EQ in the Bose Music app and redo it all, I only made minor tweaks before I was satisfied. Not that Bose gives you too many options. A 3-band EQ isn&apos;t good enough for expensive earbuds, and the existing presets largely swing things toward bass or treble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds screenshots that help personalize sound." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHbFRZkqRKLh5EtqpiQvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, if you&apos;re looking for bass, you&apos;ll find it here. There&apos;s enough of a rumble off the bat but cranking it up with Bass Boost in the EQ really turns it up. Truly, though, these earbuds are at their best when you level things, especially because the mids bring out more detail.</p><p>I also like the spatial effect of Immersive Audio for live recordings. Listening to concert albums or even high-quality stuff from YouTube brings out the crowd noise and atmosphere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-close-up.jpg" alt="Close-up view of Bose QuietComfort Ultra left earbud." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6w7FKSMjEbJKwpE6tfcdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without a doubt, the signature feature is the ANC. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds cancel out noise with the kind of regularity and reliability few others can handle. Wearing them on multiple flights, commutes, and bike rides, I&apos;m impressed at how well they dampen most noise in varying conditions. It&apos;s a mark of excellent noise-canceling earbuds that you don&apos;t have to raise the volume much at all to hear your content clearly. That was the case with these just about every time.</p><p>Sure, the odd fire truck siren or construction site jackhammer seep in, but they never feel like they&apos;ll break through entirely. By muffling them to a large degree, I didn&apos;t have to adjust anything along the way.</p><p>When I did want to hear my surroundings — a must while riding a bike in a big city — I could easily switch to Aware mode by holding down the left earbud. There&apos;s plenty of detailed clarity, which is great, except my one bone of contention is how the onboard mics filter in voices. I had to take off an earbud more than once to clarify something someone said. Maybe I&apos;m losing my hearing but I haven&apos;t experienced that with a couple of other comparable earbuds or headphones, so there&apos;s room for improvement there.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-in-hand.jpg" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds loose in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGvRnWMMYENL8gxgsyN8LN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Touch controls are sometimes hit or miss on earbuds. Not so much on these. They&apos;re responsive and accurate just about every time. Tap once to play/pause, twice to skip a track, and three times to repeat one. Swiping up or down controls volume, which the earbuds can sometimes mistake as pausing playback, but that&apos;s the only real issue you might encounter controlling the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>Tap-and-hold cycles between ANC and Aware, though you can choose a different option, like waking your voice assistant or switching between paired Bluetooth devices. Initially, Bose didn&apos;t give the QC Ultra Earbuds multipoint connectivity — the ability to stay connected to two devices simultaneously — but adding that feature in a subsequent firmware update covered a key omission.</p><p>Bose didn&apos;t really boost battery life here, so you get the same 6-hour estimate (with ANC on) that the previous QC Earbuds II have. Since noise cancelation is so effective, you don&apos;t have to raise the volume as much, which actually does the most to preserve battery each time. The case gives you three extra charges. Just keep a USB-C cable handy when it&apos;s time to recharge the whole package because there&apos;s no wireless charging here.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: What's not good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-earbuds-open-hand.jpg" alt="Open case showing the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/smFZweZqnNy4ERGNLQ8h6M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can pay an extra $49 to get a wireless charging cover and enable that feature but that feels cheap for earbuds of this caliber. Don&apos;t force people to make that choice when competitors already include it without the markup.</p><p>I&apos;m also surprised the QC Ultra Earbuds aren&apos;t better for phone calls. In spite of outstanding noise-cancelation and audio quality, call quality doesn&apos;t seem to match overall audio quality. People I spoke with weren&apos;t impressed, suggesting other earbuds I&apos;ve tested made my voice sound clearer. That&apos;s regardless of whether it was a quiet room or a bustling street. To me, it kind of feels like an extension of the Aware mode&apos;s muddier performance with voices.</p><p>IPX4 protection is also pretty barebones for earbuds, in my view, so I can&apos;t recommend these for regular workouts given what they cost. I was fine wearing them for bike rides and made sure to clean them afterward, especially since there&apos;s no dust resistance. Light runs or workouts should be fine — as well as a splash of rain — but I doubt these will last a regular, sweaty routine.</p>

<p>Bose and Sony have been jabbing each other back and forth for years over who has the best combination of comfort, sound quality, and noise-cancelation. No surprise you&apos;ll find them both at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds for Android</a>. It&apos;s usually the last one of those features that really puts them so close together, which is why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> are such a compelling alternative. It&apos;s a toss up on whether they block out more noise, but they&apos;re also a very different design and offer more personalized features than the QC Ultra Earbuds.</p><p>While they may not match Bose or Sony for world-class noise-cancelation, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-10-gen-2-review">Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2</a> earbuds are superb and offer some conveniences those others don&apos;t have. Phone calls sound great, and LE Audio means you can use the case as a way to bridge wireless audio from sources only offering a headphone jack (think of an airplane&apos;s entertainment system).</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want good sound with outstanding ANC.</li>
  <li>You want spatial audio.</li>
  <li>You want a design with stems.</li>
  <li>You travel a lot.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want wireless charging.</li>
  <li>You want a more customizable EQ.</li>
  <li>You want the best phone call quality.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Wireless earbuds are so ubiquitous today that you can choose a pair that&apos;s really good at key features you want. For the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they&apos;d have to be the combination of ANC and sound quality. Especially the noise cancelation because that&apos;s where these shine brightest against all others. You won&apos;t be disappointed in how they drown out what&apos;s happening around you.</p><p>They&apos;re a pricey proposition considering what&apos;s missing here, which is why you have to weigh what you want to prioritize most above everything else. There&apos;s room for improvement but there&apos;s no doubt Bose took a step forward with these buds.</p>

<ul><li>Google Keep already has handwriting mode for users to draw notes; an advanced version appears in the works.</li><li>The latest APK findings of the Google Keep app reveal a new handwritten notes feature, amongst other nifty improvements.</li><li>They include new backgrounds in handwriting notes mode, so you can soon see some color.</li><li>The image support in the Google Keep app should also include new tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Keep will likely add new productivity tools in the coming updates, as the latest findings of the notes app indicate new features, particularly for handwritten notes.</p><p>As noted by the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-keep-notetaking-tools-3492984/">Android Authority</a> and with their APK Insights of the latest Google Keep app bearing version <strong>5.24.422.02.90</strong>, we should see a new handwritten notes feature. The notes app already offers a handwriting mode alongside plain text, checkbox list, and image-based notes. </p><p>However, the latest handwritten notes feature looks like it is aimed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with a stylus, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, for example. It even works for users who use their fingers to draw in the aforementioned modes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3" name="google-keep-new-handwritten-notes-feature.jpg" alt="New handwritten notes feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZUCHT2cnSXA5mhrwJQed3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that the new handwritten notes will be separate from the drawing notes feature that the Google Keep app currently features. The one visible change to differentiate between two handwritten notes is the older handwriting note will have its title at the bottom, whereas the new one is believed to be shown at the top. </p><p>The latter also gains the ability to be shared as PDF files—a feature already available in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-note-taking-apps-android">note-taking apps</a> like Samsung Notes, for instance. The previous handwriting notes were only shared as image files, not PDFs, which appears to be a neat addition. </p><p>Furthermore, the new handwritten notes also mention a new "Text to sketch" feature, which will likely incorporate AI-based sketches in future updates of the Google Keep app. </p><p>Besides, the latest feature isn&apos;t just limited to Android phones for now; it has also been spotted on the web client file Keep — which is, however, uneditable at the moment and visible only as PDF, notes Android Authority.</p>

<p>Aside from the new handwritten notes, the app findings also indicate some nifty new features coming to the notes app. The handwriting mode previously had illustrations like lines and dots to choose from for the background for handwritten notes. Now, users will be able to add some color to it, as shown in the demo video. </p><p>Notes incorporating images can be moved around, resized, and cropped according to requirements. These new capabilities were seen working on the Google Keep app&apos;s tablet interface.</p><p>These findings promise valuable features for the Google Keep app, which is constantly getting neat new features like the most requested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-to-gain-window-resize-feature-soon">window resize feature</a>. The app also gained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-gains-multi-account-using-support-in-split-mode-on-foldables">a new capability recently</a> that allows people to use multiple accounts when put in split mode for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The future of Snapdragon chips is now up in the air after Arm decided to revoke Qualcomm’s license. These chips power some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android phones</a> on the market, and the ongoing clash between the two companies leaves their production in question.</p><p>Arm has given Qualcomm a 60-day notice to end their architectural license, cutting off Qualcomm's access to Arm’s chip design IP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/arm-to-cancel-qualcomm-chip-design-license-in-escalation-of-feud" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports. This marks a major escalation in their ongoing feud, which started in 2022 after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-buying-nuvia-bigger-deal-than-you-think">Qualcomm bought Nuvia</a> without renewing the licensing deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qualcomm denied Arm’s claim that it needs to end the licensing agreement. Speaking to Bloomberg, a Qualcomm representative accused Arm of trying to interfere with the legal process, calling the termination baseless. Qualcomm remains confident in its legal standing and believes its rights under the deal will be upheld.</p><p>However, if the dispute isn’t settled after the 60-day notice, Qualcomm might have to stop selling its products or face serious legal consequences, including hefty damage claims.</p><p>Arm and Qualcomm have been in a legal fight since 2022, with Qualcomm having since filed a countersuit. The dispute revolves around Qualcomm’s acquisition of Nuvia, which led to the creation of Oryon CPUs. These custom CPUs are set to roll out in mobile chips, following their first release in Windows laptops. Unlike Arm’s Cortex cores, Oryon CPUs are Qualcomm’s own unique design.</p><p>When Qualcomm acquired Nuvia, Arm argued that Nuvia’s intellectual property, developed under an Arm license, couldn’t be transferred to Qualcomm without permission or a new agreement. Arm even demanded that the designs be scrapped altogether.</p><p>Qualcomm, on the other hand, argues that its current licensing agreement already covers Nuvia’s operations, the chip-design startup it bought.</p><p>The dispute could impact SoCs with Oryon CPUs, like the Snapdragon X Elite (already in various PCs) and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. However, earlier models, such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, are expected to be unaffected.</p><p>Up to now, Qualcomm and Arm have been negotiating the use of Arm's processor architecture for designs like the Snapdragon X Elite, which powers Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs and other Windows laptops running on Arm.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/report-arm-is-sensationally-canceling-qualcomms-chip-license-oct-2024" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> points out that traditional x86 processors are losing traction due to energy concerns, pushing Microsoft to develop Windows for Arm devices. The Surface Pro 11 highlights this effort, but the current dispute could threaten the entire program.</p><p>While Copilot+ PCs are still emerging, the licensing conflict might significantly affect the global smartphone market, as Qualcomm chips are commonly found in Android phones.</p>

After nearly a decade of semi-custom designs, Qualcomm is once again leveraging a fully custom architecture, and that is immensely exciting. </p><p>As you can imagine, Qualcomm is touting heady gains across the board with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and with a node shift to 3nm, the chipset may just be one of the best we&apos;ve gotten in recent years. Here&apos;s everything you need to know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and how it compares to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Qualcomm is changing how it uses cores in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the platform featuring eight performance cores as standard. You don&apos;t get the usual efficiency cores that do a bulk of the mundane tasks, with Qualcomm emulating MediaTek in this regard. If you want to know more about why Qualcomm ditched efficiency cores with this generation, my colleague Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">talked to Qualcomm engineers</a> about why it&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>Let&apos;s take a look at how the Snapdragon 8 Elite compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek&apos;s Dimensity 9400:</p>

<p>Qualcomm significantly boosted the clocks of its cores, with the main cores now going up to 4.32GHz — nearly 1GHz more than that of the 8 Gen 3. This is because of the node shift to 3nm; Qualcomm is finally using TSMC&apos;s 3nm node, and that allows the manufacturer to deliver increased frequencies while still maintaining stable thermals. </p><p>Qualcomm is also touting heady gains on the gaming side of things, along with a new neural engine, and AI-assisted tweaks to its imaging platform. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Infographic" alt="The final Qualcomm infographic for the Snapdragon 8 Elite showing its overall performance gains compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKraGbCAKS28pn8yUhumyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm has been switching up the core configuration of its chipsets, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite comes with the biggest shift in this regard in nearly a decade. Because of the use of second-gen Oryon cores, Qualcomm is able to deliver incredible gains, with the brand touting a massive 45% gain in performance over the 8 Gen 3 in single-core and multi-core workloads.</p><p>What&apos;s also interesting is that the 8 Elite is 44% more efficient while performing the same workloads as the 8 Gen 3, and that&apos;s more than a generational increase. Qualcomm used semi-custom design in recent years, where it would basically license Arm cores and add a few custom features, while retaining Kryo branding.</p><p>However, with the Oryon cores, Qualcomm is using Arm&apos;s architectural license; it takes the instruction set from Arm and then builds the core from the ground up, allowing it much better flexibility. The return to custom cores gives the Snapdragon 8 Elite a sizeable advantage, and close the gap to Apple&apos;s silicon.</p><p>In fact, this is similar to Apple&apos;s approach with its A series chipsets, and although Qualcomm used to do the same in the past, we haven&apos;t seen fully custom cores from the chip vendor following the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm is once again able to deliver custom designs thanks to its acquisition of Nuvia back in 2021.</p><p>What does the switch to the custom architecture entail? Well, Qualcomm is touting incredible gains in performance over the 8 Gen 3, and that should make a difference in real-world use. Qualcomm is just using two core clusters this time, and that allows the brand to tailor tasks with better efficiency — we got four clusters last year.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the 4.32GHz frequency on the main cores; this is considerably more than previous years, and while the cores only go up to the maximum frequency in very short bursts, it should still make a difference.</p>

<p>Coming to the gaming side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Elite switches up the naming convention once again, with Qualcomm just going with Adreno branding without any model numbers. Again, we get heady figures, with Qualcomm touting a 40% increase in performance. What is much more interesting is that the GPU is 40% more efficient at the same tasks as the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>The GPU also includes increased video memory, and there&apos;s a 35% uptick in ray tracing along with the ability to use Unreal Engine 5’s Nanite engine. All of these features are undoubtedly great, but what I&apos;m interested in knowing is how phones with the platform handle sustained gaming; this has been an issue on the 8 Gen 3, and while there was no shortage of power, it led to overheating and thermal constraints.</p><p>It remains to be seen if those issues have been mitigated with this generation, and if we actually get usable titles that have ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>You can&apos;t go two minutes in the tech industry without a mention of AI, and Qualcomm is rolling out several upgrades in this area as well. The Hexagon NPU has a 45% increase in AI performance, along with 45% better efficiency per watt. It integrates multimodal AI engines, including Gemini Nano.</p><p>While I don&apos;t see the point of mobile AI just yet, what is interesting is how Qualcomm is leveraging machine learning into its imaging platform. The Spectra AI ISP now includes limitless real-time semantic segmentation, and that should deliver better portrait shots. You get to see these benefits in videos as well, and that&apos;s just great.</p>

<ul><li>The floating bottom bar in Google Chat now has a pill shape instead of a circular design, along with a bit of extra width.</li><li>The color scheme has been upgraded with Dynamic Color, enhancing contrast and overall look in Google Chat.</li><li>Plus, the last icon switched from the @ symbol to three dots.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing a floating bottom navigation bar to Google Chat around a year ago, Google is now sprucing it up to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/material-you">Material You</a> vibe.</p><p>The floating bottom bar, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-new-navigation-bar">debuted about a year ago as part of a bigger Google redesign</a>, just got a fresh new look. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/21/google-chat-floating-bottom-bar-material-you/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this refresh makes everything feel more cohesive and visually appealing in the app.</p><p>Prior to this update, the floating bottom bar had a circular shape that helped you spot the active feed. It featured four icons and a button to start a new message. Now, it’s been reshaped into a pill-like design and widened a bit.</p><p>While this change might take up a little more screen space, this refresh gives it a style that jives better with how other Google apps work.</p><p>The fresh design <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-ai-gemini-summaries-update">debuted along with Gemini summaries</a>, which are now popping up in Google Chat's Home view. Just long-press a thread on your phone, and Gemini summaries will help you get up to speed on any missed conversations. The AI assistant will provide three bullet points summarizing the key points.</p><p>For those using Google Chat on desktop, a 'Summarize' button shows up when you hover over a conversation thread. Clicking it works like the long-press on mobile, giving you a quick summary of the chat.</p><p>Another upgrade is the new color scheme. The background of the floating bottom bar now uses Dynamic Color, letting it blend in nicely with your device's color palette.</p><p>This change boosts its contrast with the rest of the Chat interface, making everything look nicer together. Also, the last icon has swapped out the @ symbol for three dots. All these tweaks come together to create a more stylish and unified user interface in the app.</p><p>Right now, though, the floating bottom bar design is unique to Google Chat, but at least the recent updates have made it look good enough to hang out with the other Google apps.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out a bunch of new security features for its Messages app that use on-device AI to fend off spam, shady links, and other digital junk.</p><p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">top messaging app</a> picked up some upgraded scam detection, zeroing in on catching fake delivery and job offer scams.</p><p>If it detects a potential scam, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> will either toss it into the spam folder or alert you with a warning. It uses on-device machine learning to catch these tricks while keeping your chats private, according to the search giant's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This update is currently being tested by beta users who have activated the spam protection feature.</p><p>Next up, Google is rolling out smart alerts for potentially risky links. These malicious URLs can cause serious trouble, from installing harmful software to sending users to fake phishing sites.</p><p>The messaging app will alert users when they get links from unknown sources and filter out messages with such links. Currently, Google is testing this feature with users in India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, with plans to roll it out globally later this year.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that while many scam texts come from abroad, they’re not all international. Google has revealed that users will soon be able to automatically hide messages from international senders not in their contacts. Those messages will go straight to the "Spam & blocked" folder. This feature is currently being tested in Singapore and will roll out to more countries soon.</p><p>The latest safety upgrades also bring smart alerts that automatically blur nudity in images. If users try to share explicit content, they'll get a warning about the potential risks. This feature will be enabled by default for users under 18, while adults will have to opt in via the Android settings.  This update is expected to roll out in the coming months for Android devices running version 9 or later.</p><p>Scammers don’t only rely on international numbers; they often impersonate real businesses or even friends. To combat these tricks, the Messages app is launching a contact verification system that uses each contact's public key to confirm their identity, checking sender credentials via a QR code or registered phone number.</p><p>Let’s hope Google speeds up the rollout of these new features. After all, over a billion people are counting on Google Messages to keep their daily chats flowing, as per the company.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">Pixel 7 Pro</a> blew us away when it was unveiled a few years ago, and it still impresses in 2024 with efficient Tensor G2 performance, some fun camera features, and OS updates through October 2025. It may not be the newest kid on the block any more, but if you want a smartphone for under 500 bucks, this deal on the Pixel 7 Pro is an awesome choice. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQVFQHD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="729fcdbc-7457-448c-8b51-79cb7d03a35a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>That&apos;s a truly remarkable discount on a device that we considered to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> that money can buy back in 2022. While the Pixel 7 Pro has since been replaced by newer models, it&apos;s got a larger AMOLED display than the similarly-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, plus awesome cameras, the still-capable Tensor G2 chipset, and software support through October 2025, at least.</p><p>The only issue with buying the Pixel 7 Pro in 2024 is that you won&apos;t get as many OS and security updates as you would with a newer phone, and that curved screen that Google later abandoned may not be for everyone. It&apos;s also worth noting that this discount is coming from a third-party seller at Amazon, so I can see it disappearing shortly after I hit that Publish button.</p><p>Still, the Pixel 7 Pro has stood the test of time and will likely go down in the smartphone history books as one of the best phones that Google ever produced. Getting your hands on one of these devices for under $500 seems like a no-brainer, and it isn&apos;t even Black Friday yet.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="which-retailer-has-the-best-black-friday-samsung-deals-2">Which retailer has the best Black Friday Samsung deals?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you&apos;re looking for! Pretty much every retailer under the sun will be launching holiday sales as we approach Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, so you&apos;ll want to be vigilant and look around before committing to one retailer (or you could simply bookmark Androidcentral.com for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">comprehensive deal coverage</a>). </p><p>That being said, if you are hoping to buy unlocked Samsung devices, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart will probably be your best bet. If you&apos;re willing to make a trade-in or update your wireless service, consider checking with your phone carrier or Samsung itself to see what offers are available. </p>
<h2 id="should-i-shop-on-black-friday-or-cyber-monday-xa0-2">Should I shop on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? </h2>
<p>The biggest discounts on devices such as smartphones, TVs, and video game consoles usually go live on Black Friday, while Cyber Monday is typically a better time to purchase smaller items like accessories and smart home tech. With that being said, some devices will sell out before Monday hits, so don&apos;t wait to buy if something catches your eye. </p>

<h2 id="when-will-black-friday-sales-start-2">When will Black Friday sales start?</h2>
<p>Although no retailers are naming it as such, the Black Friday sales have pretty much already begun. In the coming days, you&apos;ll see retailers across the web launching sales to get shoppers ready for the holiday season — the big question is whether these offers will improve as we near November 29th. Needless to say, if you&apos;re looking for a Samsung deal this holiday season, bookmark this page: I&apos;ll keep updating this guide with new offers as they go live. </p>
<h2 id="what-samsung-deals-can-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung deals can I expect during Black Friday?</h2>
<p>If Amazon&apos;s recent Prime Day sale (aka Big Deal Days) is any indication, you can expect the return of record-breaking discounts on the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6, and the latest lineup of Samsung smartwatches. Samsung smart TVs are also likely to receive some major discounts, and if we&apos;re lucky, we might see the first batch of price drops on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and Galaxy Tab S10 series of tablets. </p>

<ul><li>Google Translate has an Instant Translate feature that converts text from one language to another as you type.</li><li>Currently, if you use Instant Translate, you don't have access to some Google Translate tools.</li><li>A future update may bring the full slate of Google Translate features to Instant Translate mode, providing a more straightforward experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Translation apps, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-adds-110-new-languages">Google Translate</a>, are getting reliable enough that you can use them as a real-time translator. Part of that is due to features like Live Translate, which translates speech across languages, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Instant Translate</a>, which converts text from one language to another. </p><p>However, if you use Instant Translate, you'll lose out on a few major Google Translate features. With an upcoming software update, Instant Translate could gain full feature parity with the regular Google Translate mode.</p><p>The feature was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-translate-richer-seamless-instant-translate-apk-teardown-3492801/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, who demonstrated the new Instant Translate functionality in the YouTube video below.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPqJFw9bEL0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The changes were picked up in Android Authority's teardown of the APK for <strong>v8.20.71.687383449.1</strong> of the Google Translate app. While there's no guarantee that this functionality will be released to the public, it's clear that Google is testing big changes to Instant Translate. After the team at Android Authority managed to activate the feature, they saw all the Google Translate UI elements in Instant Translate mode. </p><p>When you use the default Google Translate mode in the mobile app, you have a lot of features at your fingertips. You can translate text, of course, but the user interface packs many more tools. For starters, the output can be spoken and copied. There will also be definitions and grammar suggestions that will help you understand the way words and phrases differ across languages.</p><p>The unfortunate part of using Instant Translate is that all these tools go away when this mode is activated. It'll convert text from one language to another as you type in real-time, but the above actions — from speaking to copying — are unavailable until you exit Instant Translate. That is, for now. The upcoming version of the Google Translate app could bring all the above functionality to Instant Translate mode, making it one of the best ways to use the app. </p><p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes to Instant Translate are available to users of the Google Translate app soon. In addition to the new functionality for Instant Translate, the report notes that Google Translate may add the ability to recover a recently deleted translation. </p>

<p>Whether or not you have any interest in owning or riding in a self-driving car, Qualcomm says that its automaker clients want to pack their cars with more AI technology. With its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite, the company is promising ambitious, futuristic AI capabilities that hover between exciting and science-fiction.</p><p>Available starting in 2025, the 2nd-gen Cockpit Elite uses the same Oryon CPU tech found in its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> CPUs—which were announced yesterday at the Qualcomm Summit—with 3X the CPU performance of the last Snapdragon Cockpit. It also sports a Hexagon NPU with 12X-boosted AI and an Adreno GPU capable of supporting an absurd 16 4K displays simultaneously in one car, as well as "real-time ray tracing" and "immersive 3D experiences" for "critical visual information."</p><p>I asked the Qualcomm team why any car would need that much graphical power; they explained that this allows your car's infotainment display to span the entire front dashboard while still leaving processing power for TVs on seatbacks for passengers and graphical augmentations on your side mirrors.</p><p>Presumably, non-autonomous vehicles wouldn't need as many distracting screens, but luxury automakers would have that option.</p>

<p>The boosted CPU supports simultaneous tasks like navigation, music, calling, and gaming simultaneously. But the flashy star of Cockpit Elite, unsurprisingly, is the AI tech.</p><p>Qualcomm says its Hexagon NPU is "built to handle Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters." Each car's specific hands-free assistant would be trained on the car's manual so you could, for example, ask what a warning light means.</p><p>Snapdragon Cockpit Elite would also "learn and adapt to your preferences," Qualcomm claims, and even "take actions automatically." This part of the presentation felt looser on hard details; I asked what exact preferences the AI could learn, and heard examples like your car routing you home without your input if you usually do so at that time. It could also recognize which backup route you like to take during heavy traffic, or guide another driver (like your spouse) towards your usual parking spot.</p><p>In addition, Snapdragon Elite would recognize the number of passengers and change its usual patterns accordingly, like preventing phone notifications if someone else could hear them or using "zonal audio" to localize relevant audio to the driver while focusing on music for the passengers.</p>

<p>Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon Ride Elite, which essentially pairs with Cockpit Elite as a single SoC for self-driving cars.</p><p>Ride Elite supports up to 40 sensors, including multiple 16MP cameras with 360º FoV and passenger-facing infrared cameras. It's meant to capture signs, lanes, and objects clearly, as well as recognize passenger gestures.</p><p>It simultaneously supports radar/lidar point-cloud processing, automotive security when parked, and other behavioral AI tricks like auto-rerouting around accidents, self-guided parking, and opening your sunroof depending on the weather.</p>

<p>All combined, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite seem to promise smarts that are good enough to power the talking AI car from Knight Rider. We'll have to see how much a powerful SoC like this costs, both for automakers and for consumers, and whether the ambitious AI promises actually lead to helpful automation for drivers.</p>
