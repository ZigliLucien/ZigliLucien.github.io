<ul><li>Threads has pushed a change to its desktop UI that wastes a lot of space in the app's view.</li><li>The feed is still centered, however, users can only change the type of feed in a drop-down menu nestled above it.</li><li>The remainder of Threads' UI is thrown off to the left side, mirroring the likes of Instagram on computers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Threads has pushed an update to its user interface on the desktop and is giving us Instagram vibes.</p><p>Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich spotted the change earlier this morning (May 31) and made note of the sheer Instagram callbacks. For one, Threads on PCs now looks like it&apos;s designed purely for the vertical screen, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>. Sutrich noted the increased amount of wasted space surrounding the Threads feed, which can be changed from "For You" to "Following" and more.</p><p>Users can quickly rediscover content they&apos;ve "liked" or "saved" through that drop-down menu.</p><p>The feed is still centered, however, those feed settings are now the only piece of UI remaining at the top in a drop-down menu. Other options, like Home, Search, Activity, and your profile are now off to the far left side vertically.</p><p>The new post button is nestled on the bottom right of the screen.</p><p>Threads has also implemented some slight color alterations, with the primary feed becoming a little lighter than the background in light and dark mode.</p>

<p>Instagram has looked like this for a while now on desktop, with its primary feed centered, stories on top, and other UI elements tossed to the left side. While Instagram&apos;s version offers a lot of space, it&apos;s taken down a bit due to its written-out feature names and a box of suggested profiles on the right.</p><p>The old Threads view was much more confined, featuring everything one would need in the center of their screen on a PC.</p><p>Additionally, there&apos;s a chance Threads is trying to appease <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> and other tablet UI devices with this change. How Instagram&apos;s desktop UI functions for such devices fits perfectly, so maybe we should&apos;ve seen this coming. Threads&apos; new UI for computers seems widely available now.</p><p>In other news, Threads rolled out a feature that allowed users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/threads-allows-users-to-limit-quote-posts-on-the-app-and-web">limit who could quote</a> their posts on the platform earlier in May. After posting, the owner can select a few options: Anyone, Profiles you follow, and Mentioned Only. What&apos;s more, X (formerly Twitter) users will recognize this.</p><p>Instagram&apos;s head, Adam Mosseri, stated the change is designed to let users "restrict others who look to demean or troll them, a safe space to share thoughts..."</p>

Fortunately, the Big Three carrier has just launched a Samsung Galaxy S23 deal that lacks <em>most </em>of that pesky fine print: add a line with an eligible data plan and you&apos;ll score enough promo credits to make the phone 100% free. No kidding. </p><p>All of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon&apos;s current Unlimited plans</a> will get you the free phone, but if you choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you could choose to get a FREE Amazon 65-inch Omni Series Fire TV instead. That&apos;s a $799.99 value, the only catch is that you&apos;ll have to pay full price for the phone to get the TV. </p>

<p>The compact <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> may be last year's flagship, but it's still a sweet Android phone, coming complete with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, a lovely 6.1-inch AMOLED display, and years of software support guaranteed. You even get to enjoy all of those fancy Galaxy AI features that the OEM has been talking about.  Buy the phone and add an eligible line to your Verizon service and you'll get $699.99 in promo credits over 36 months. That makes the S23 completely free. </p>
<p>That being said, if you don't mind paying for the phone, you can choose the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan and get a FREE 65-inch smart TV out of the deal, because why not? <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s23/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8b668dca-1628-4ee3-92cf-3feef5bc87ed" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB: $699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Of course, if money isn&apos;t an object, you&apos;ll be better off going straight to the newer Samsung Galaxy S24 — but when you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-s23">Galaxy S23 vs S24</a>, you&apos;ll see that the two phones aren&apos;t actually <em>that </em>different. Sure, the Galaxy S23 has an older processor and a slightly smaller display, but you won&apos;t notice any real difference with day to day use. So if you&apos;re a Verizon user or you&apos;re looking to switch, why not take advantage of this offer and get one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released last year?  </p>

It can withstand the pressure 50 meters of water can create, but that doesn't mean you can submerge it in 50 meters (164 feet) of water.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-to-keep-in-mind-when-using-your-fitbit-ace-lte-near-water-2">What to keep in mind when using your Fitbit Ace LTE near water</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-launch">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>&apos;s 5ATM basic rating means atmospheres and is not waterproof enough to go to the pool&apos;s deep end for long periods. Instead, the kid&apos;s wearable is water-resistant. This means kids can wear it without worrying about water damage when splashing around in the bathtub, playing in the rain, or helping mom and dad with the dishes.</p><p>ATM represents atmosphere, which is the international standard for how much pressure the wearable can withstand. So, the Fitbit Ace LTE can withstand 50 meters of pressure for 10 minutes. If you see a 3ATM rating, that means that the watch can only withstand 30 meters of water pressure. The lowest rating you&apos;ll see is 1ATM, and the highest is 20ATM.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">These smartwatches</a> are tested in a lab with fresh water sources, not salt or highly chlorinated pool water. To be safe, it is a very good idea to take the smartwatch off before diving into the pool.</p><p>What&apos;s the difference between waterproof and water-resistant? When something is waterproof, it&apos;s impervious and entirely sealed from any damage water can cause. When a device is water-resistant, it can resist the perforation of water up to a certain point. When the Fitbit Ace LTE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kid&apos;s smartwatch</a> leaves the factory, it comes with a rating of 5ATM under ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard 22810:2010. Still, that rating can degrade over time due to drops, normal wear and tear, disassembly, or damage. So, it&apos;s a good idea to put the Fitbit Ace LTE in a waterproof pouch to keep it safe.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE kid&apos;s wearable is designed for use in shallow water and does not involve activities with water at high velocity or temperature. If you get some water on the wearable, Fitbit recommends drying the watch and the band for proper care. The smartwatch is not dustproof, so extra care is a must in dusty areas, which will help prolong the device&apos;s use for a while.</p><p>You won&apos;t find an IP rating on the Fitbit Ace LTE, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t tell the amount of water it can be exposed to, thanks to the 5ATM rating. What&apos;s the difference between an IP and ATM rating? The IP rating indicates the protection a device has against water and dust. The highest IP rating available is the IP69K.</p><p>As noted before, an ATM rating measures the water pressure a device can withstand before suffering water damage, and is more common in wearables. A 20ATM rating is suitable for pressure equal to a depth of 200 meters and can be used in high-speed water sports, snorkeling, diving, and everyday activities such as showering and getting caught in the rain.</p><p>The bottom line: It&apos;s best to put the smartwatch aside when going to the water park to keep it safe.

<ul><li>Google Home brings a new ability to control volume on multiple speakers. </li><li>Users can control the volume via the Google Home app or can use their voice through Google Assistant. </li><li>The ability to Group Volume Control from the Android lock screen is also promised.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Home has been adding nifty, highly requested updates to its devices, with the most recent on that went out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-for-web-getting-camera-history-and-clip-editor-in-new-update">March</a>. The feature addition continues as the Google Nest community announced new controls for the Google Home app for Android devices.</p><p>Starting this month, the Google Home app has regained the ability to control volume on multiple speakers or devices at once, the team has announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Controlling-volume-for-multiple-speakers-in-the-Google-Home-app/ba-p/623411">blog post</a>. Users can also control the volume with their voice through Google Assistant.</p><p>The other forthcoming addition will also let users access Group Volume controls directly on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>&apos;s lock screen through smart displays like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Google Nest hub</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fQwbaxdYo82QwAow6DAMc" name="google-home-new-volume-controls.jpg" alt="New volume controls for Google Home app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQwbaxdYo82QwAow6DAMc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The team also shared a how-to guide that helps users enable the updates: opening the app, starting a playback session, and tapping on the mini-player. Users can then tap on the output selector, which allows them to either add or remove the speakers dynamically or select from the existing set of speaker groups. They can then adjust the volume slide bar per their listening preference.</p><p>Additionally, those who prefer controlling their speakers through voice commands can do so through Google Assistant. Just like asking the Assistant to play music, they can command it for their entire speaker group by saying, “Hey Google, turn it up,” which makes the volume increase by 10 percent, or they can also command, “Hey Google, set volume to 40%.”</p>
<p>The full list of compatible hubs for Google Home devices can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7174267">found here</a>, which includes devices like Google Nest Mini, Google Home, Chromecast with Google TV, and more.</p><p>The latest volume-controlling ability follows the addition of camera history and clip editor via a new update rolled out to Google Home for the web in March. It was rolled out to users who opted for Public Preview to test the new features first.</p>

<ul><li>Google News began experiencing a worldwide outage on May 31, 2024, around 8 AM ET.</li><li>Some other Google services, like Google Drive, have also displayed errors while trying to edit and create new documents.</li><li>Users across the world have been reporting problems accessing these Google services, meaning it's not just a regional problem.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Friday might be a bit of a slow news day if you&apos;re a free Google News service user. As of 8 AM ET on Friday, May 31, 2024, users around the world began reporting issues accessing the Google News service, which aggregates news Google deems important to them.</p><p>The website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/google/">Downdetector</a> confirms the outage, which Android Central and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/mobile-apps/google-news-goes-down-for-millions-of-users-worldwide-in-mysterious-outage">Tom&apos;s Guide</a> first noticed this morning. Visiting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/">Google News page</a> will display upside down ice cream cones with a rather generic error of "Uh-oh, something went wrong. Please try again."</p>

<p>Outages like this happen from time to time but services as large and prolific as Google&apos;s often cause a larger wake than others may. It&apos;s not just Google News that&apos;s down— creating new documents in Google Drive has been throwing up errors, too, this morning, and our staff hasn&apos;t been able to get some two-factor authentication dialogs to appear on my phone, which also relies on Google services.</p><p>At the moment, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://status.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud services</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://status.search.google.com/">Google Search services</a> health dashboards don&apos;t show any problems, which is rather strange given the number of users having issues with Google services.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the outage but they did not get back to us in time for publication. We will update the article once we have more information.</p>

<p>Spotify is giving its Android app a facelift by ditching the border around its icon, going back to its classic look from five years ago.</p><p>Before this, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-premium-music-video-beta-launch">Spotify</a> icon had a green logo on a black background. Now, thanks to Will Sattelberg of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/spotify-refreshed-android-app-icon/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, we know the new icon is just the green Spotify logo with no black background.</p><p>Originally, the Spotify Android app featured a simple circle with the Spotify logo, just like the desktop version. But in 2019, the company added a black border to support adaptive icons that could change shape.</p><p>For devices with circular icons, the new design fills the entire space with the Spotify logo. It works with both unthemed and themed icons, although the themed ones don’t blend as well with other icons.</p><p>Interestingly, this change only affects devices with circular icons. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung Galaxy</a> or another device with differently shaped icons, the black border will come back.</p>

<p>Android Police points out that on phones supporting icon shape changes, the change just zooms in on the icon, resulting in some ugly black outlines on non-circular shapes. Samsung phones, in particular, get an extra-thick border.</p><p>This isn’t a huge deal, but it’s definitely a curious change. The black background was distinctive and helped the app stand out. The new borderless version looks a bit strange, especially on phones without circular icons.</p><p>The updated Spotify icon comes with app version 8.9.44.368 and is currently only available on Android, with no changes for the iOS app icon yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Like other Chinese accessory makers, Baseus has branched out into a lot of new segments in recent months, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/baseus-eli-sport-1-review">Eli Sport 1 earbuds</a> in particular stand out for their open-ear profile. But charging tech is where Baseus is at its best, and the brand&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-blade-100w-review">Blade 100W power bank</a> continues to be one of the best around.</p><p>With the Blade 2, Baseus is taking a slightly different route. The focus is now on an even sleeker design, and at a thickness of just 10mm, it is just as svelte as a phone. The Blade 2 has a smaller 12000mah battery — instead of the 20000mAh on the Blade — and as such, the power bank weighs just 328g. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Control-12000mAh-Portable/dp/B0CQT9XLH3">retails for $89 on Amazon</a>, but Baseus is running an enticing deal right now that discounts the Blade 2 by 30%, bringing the effective cost down to just $63.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLqez9LPxVQz3DFoeb2S78" name="baseus-blade-2-10.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLqez9LPxVQz3DFoeb2S78.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other differences; the Blade 2 only goes up to 65W, so it isn&apos;t as versatile at charging notebooks. It is also available in interesting color choices, and while that isn&apos;t a consideration when choosing a power bank, the Blade 2 looks a lot better than the standard black option of the Blade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nAYM5ePkdL2ym4qxK58Vi7" name="baseus-blade-2-9.jpg" alt="Side view of Baseus Blade 2 next to 100W Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAYM5ePkdL2ym4qxK58Vi7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the design of the Blade 2 is much more refined, and it conveys a sense of style that wasn&apos;t evident on the original Blade. The power bank retains Baseus&apos;s custom design, so you get a rectangular chassis with rounded edges that&apos;s thinner and wider than most power banks. It doesn&apos;t look like a power bank at an initial glance, and the ultra-thin design makes it easily portable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sNhsAqWeKig34KS5z5j7B5" name="baseus-blade-2-1.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 power bank against blue background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNhsAqWeKig34KS5z5j7B5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m using the blue color variant of the Blade 2, and the power bank is also available in silver and orange colors. Baseus bundles a 100W USB-C to USB-C cable in the box as well as a carrying pouch, and the lighter design combined with new colors gives the Blade 2 a much better presence. While I like the design quite a bit, the glossy plastic coat means the power bank is a smudge magnet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s5SoyM999Xpo27ZYFKHcP8" name="baseus-blade-2-11.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 ports next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5SoyM999Xpo27ZYFKHcP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I&apos;m not as enthused about is the port selection; because of the thinner design, Baseus had to ditch the USB-A port, so you only get two USB-C ports on the Blade 2. That again limits the number of devices that can be used with the power bank; I routinely plug in accessories like smartwatches, and they still rely on a USB-A connector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdkohnM4QCMnVwbbTE2wA6" name="baseus-blade-2-2.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 has a built-in panel that shows charging information" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdkohnM4QCMnVwbbTE2wA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like its predecessor, the Blade 2 has a built-in screen that shows battery life and charging info. It is brighter and easier to read, and the only issue I have with it is that the battery level is showcased in the center, with the real-time charging details tucked away in the corner — it should have been the other way around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zhd5Qu5SCnVz8fNvi45Gi6" name="baseus-blade-2-6.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 has two USB-C ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhd5Qu5SCnVz8fNvi45Gi6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the same USB PD 3.0 charging tech, but it only goes up to 65W. This isn&apos;t an issue with the Blade 2 as it&apos;s evident that the power bank is designed to be used with phones, and the 12000mAh battery isn&apos;t large enough to charge notebooks anyway. You can still top up a MacBook and have enough charge left over for a phone, but if you need to do that consistently, you&apos;re much better off with the original Blade.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Pho6X3qnzCfb96hhLByyJ7" name="baseus-blade-2-8.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to 100W Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pho6X3qnzCfb96hhLByyJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Blade 2 wins out is the portability; the thinner design and lighter weight makes it the ideal choice in daily use. The dual USB-C ports are great for charging two phones at once, and you get the 65W power budget split into 45W and 20W across both ports. On that note, here&apos;s a rundown of the charging profiles that you get with the power bank:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 Output (65W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 Input (60W Max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3A (60W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 (65W Max):</strong> 45W + 20W</li></ul>
<p>I used the power bank with several devices — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a> — and didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. It delivered a consistent charge, and was able to fully charge two devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JTVX4U3GVcwkDgXV2akj79" name="baseus-blade-2-14.jpg" alt="Baseus Blade 2 next to Blade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTVX4U3GVcwkDgXV2akj79.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the biggest limitation is the 12000mAh battery; while it is still a decent option for charging phones, it doesn&apos;t measure up if you want to use it with notebooks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> feature a 20000mAh battery and 65W charging — Baseus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-Baseus-20000mAh-Charging/dp/B08THCNNCS">makes one that&apos;s just $45</a> — and you get a USB-A port. Yes, these power banks have a "traditional" design and aren&apos;t as sleek as the Blade 2, but they have much better utility, and are a better value.</p><p>Ultimately, the Blade 2 is aimed at a niche; if you want a lightweight power bank and only intend to use it with your phone, it is a decent enough choice. Otherwise, you should just get the standard Blade.</p>

<hr>
<p>Folks might remember when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the virtual stage in 2021 and debuted the Metaverse. During the unveiling, one of the keystone examples was a vision of at-home workouts with real coaches that can be virtually placed in your home, lending the authenticity and personability these platforms currently lack.</p><p>Surprisingly, Meta isn&apos;t going to be the company that actually invents this, despite ushering in the vision. Instead, that honor will go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alomoves.com/">Alo Moves</a>, an online on-demand "movement and mindfulness" platform that&apos;s currently creating a new high-tech mixed reality app for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> that&apos;s co-developed with the Oscar-winning visual effects studio, Magnopus.</p><p>The Alo Moves Quest 3 app will give at-home yoga fans to virtually see a life-sized instructor in their own home, recreated in lifelike three-dimensional space thanks to a unique volumetric capture method. This will allow players to not only move around the coach as they might in real life but also to use the power of mixed reality and "shrink" the coach so they can be placed anywhere in the room for easy reference during movement and mindfulness sessions.</p><p>The concept of this is very similar to what we saw in Zuckerberg&apos;s initial unveiling of Metaverse concepts, which would provide the tools for people to experience virtual activities in a way that feels more like an in-person event.</p><p>Alo Moves will deliver regular five to twenty-four minute classes with real instructors similar to Supernatural, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/5">best Meta Quest 3 exercise apps</a>, but the key difference is that the coach will be in your home rather than in a virtual environment. That ensures that folks feel comfortable and safe since they can see their surroundings while still being able to focus on the workout.</p><p>Alo Moves XR is currently listed as coming soon and can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5379012005560059">wishlisted on the Meta Horizon store</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The mixed reality wars are heating up, and the latest partnership announcement between Google and Magic Leap further proves it. Magic Leap announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/newsroom/magic-leap-and-google-partnership">on the company&apos;s blog</a> that it would enter a new, multi-faceted strategic technology partnership with Google to "expand the long-standing relationship between the two companies."</p><p>Magic Leap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-2">currently makes</a> augmented reality glasses that are used in commercial and enterprise spaces for things like virtual training, manufacturing, and demonstrations, among other things. While the announcement doesn&apos;t specifically announce new hardware, the company says that "Magic Leap’s leadership in optics and manufacturing" will be combined with Google&apos;s technology platforms to "foster the future of the XR ecosystem with unique and innovative product offerings."</p><p>At Google I/O 2024, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">quickly demonstrated</a> a new pair of AR glasses that use the new Project Astra AI platform. The demonstration was short but impressive, showing how AI could be used on a pair of mixed-reality glasses to help people solve problems and even remember where they left things like car keys and glasses. It&apos;s not known if these glasses are just internal prototypes at Google or something to have to do with this Magic Leap partnership.</p><p>Android Central has contacted Google to obtain additional information about this partnership, but they did not respond in time for publication. We will update the article once we hear back.</p><p>Google is already an investor in Magic Leap, so the partnership makes sense given Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">renewed sense of interest</a> in XR after the debut of the Apple Vision Pro. Magic Leap has been making AR glasses for years, so it makes sense for Google to partner with a company that already has experience in the space in order for it to build out its expected upcoming Android XR platform.</p><p>Google is already in another partnership with Samsung to deliver the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung XR headset</a>, expected to debut later this year. Meanwhile, Quest 3 maker Meta recently announced that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">would partner with companies</a> like Xbox, Lenovo, and Asus ROG to create new headsets using its own Horizon OS.</p>

<hr>
<p>One of Samsung&apos;s apps has supposedly spilled some juicy details about its smart ring&apos;s rediscoverability if it was misplaced.</p><p>According to an APK deep dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-lost-mode-3447019/">Android Authority</a>, the Samsung Find app seemingly contains information about a "Lost Mode" for the Galaxy Ring. Strings in the code suggest the Galaxy Ring will feature a light on its body, which will blink so users find it. A few string examples include "Tap start to make the light on your ring blink" and "Ring light is blinking."</p><p>Another string will appear if your phone can&apos;t reach the Galaxy Ring. The example reads, "couldn&apos;t connect to Ring to start blinking."</p><p>The publication&apos;s APK findings show that users must first enable "Lost Mode" through the Samsung Find app. There also appears to be a security feature on the way that locks a user&apos;s Samsung account in the app so mischievous individuals can&apos;t grab your ring data.</p><p>Similarly, there&apos;s another security measure for the ring embedded in the code: "this ring will be locked to your Samsung account. No one else will be able to use it."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:562px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.76%;"><img id="3pU5wvccEpz5fzBZotitkA" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-lost-mode-light.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Ring might feature a "Lost Mode" that produces a light from the ring's body for relocation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3pU5wvccEpz5fzBZotitkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="562" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What&apos;s curious about the ring&apos;s secure lock to a user&apos;s Samsung account is that it seems useful for data protection (presumably) without compromise. The publication reiterates that the Oura ring features "data protection" to an extent, as the device will lock itself down in "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025592293-Transfer-Your-Oura-Data-to-a-New-Phone">Restricted Mode</a>." This activates if the device, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Gen 3 Ring</a>, is trying to connect to another phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Oura&apos;s method of safeguarding your ring&apos;s data involves a full data wipe (factory reset) if it senses a new device pair attempt.</p><p>With this discovery coming from the Find app, it seems Samsung is continuing to prepare for the Galaxy Ring&apos;s launch later this year. We&apos;ve also heard of a "Lost Mode" before, as Samsung highlighted it during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Galaxy SmartTag</a> launch in October. The mode is also used to relocate a handful of other Galaxy devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring made its expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-fcc-listing-cradle-specs-confirmed">debut at the FCC</a> for certification purposes two days ago, and with it came some important details. From its listing, the device was confirmed to arrive in nine different variants (ring size), and the battery capacities for each size were detailed. Additionally, the FCC&apos;s database offered a look at the device&apos;s charging "cradle." Not much else about it was learned through the lackluster mock-up.</p><p>Samsung is preparing for its summer Unpacked event, rumored to take place on July 10 in Paris, France.</p>
