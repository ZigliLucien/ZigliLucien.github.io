<p>When deciding which tablet to buy, comparing the two most probable candidates is essential. This OnePlus Pad 2 vs. Google Pixel Tablet face-off will hopefully give you enough information about which one has the specs you need in a tablet.</p><p>One tablet does have a more powerful processor, but which tablet you go with will depend on what specs are most important to you and your budget. Which one is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablet</a> for you?</p>

<p>If you have a weakness for bigger tablets, you might like the OnePlus Pad 2 more. It&apos;s a bigger tablet with 2.68.7 x 195.1 x 6.5mm and a glass front aluminum frame and back. It&apos;s also heavier, 584 grams. Unfortunately, the tablet doesn&apos;t have an IP rating, meaning the users must be cautious when using it in dusty areas and where there are bodies of water around. </p><p>When you hold the tablet in landscape mode, the camera module is in the top center. Hopefully, you like the color gray, as Nimbus gray is the only color option for the tablet.</p><p>On the other hand, the Google Pixel tablet is a smaller tablet that measures 258 x 169 x 8.1mm, weighs 493 grams, has a glass front, and has an aluminum back and frame. It also does not have an IP rating, meaning you&apos;ll need to be as careful around dusty areas and water as its competitor. The camera on the Pixel Tablet is located at the top left in landscape mode and is smaller. The color options aren&apos;t plentiful with the Pixel tablet either since it&apos;s limited to Hazel and Porcelain colors.</p>

<p>There is a clear winner regarding the display in this OnePlus Pad 2 vs. Google Pixel Tablet comparison. The OnePlus Pad 2 has a larger 12.2-inch LCD with a higher 2,120 x 3,000 resolution display. The tablet also has a faster 144Hz refresh rate, 303 PPI, 900 nits peak brightness, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision.</p><p>The Google Pixel tablet has a 10.95-inch IPS LCD 1,600 x 2,560 resolution display with a 276 PPI density, offering a less sharper image on the tablet. The refresh rate does not match the OnePlus Pad 2 since it only reaches 90Hz, and the peak brightness also falls short of the Pad 2 since it only reaches 500 nits brightness.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 comes out on top with a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor with up to 3.3GHz clock speed. It also has 12GB of RAM, six speakers for high-resolution audio, and a 13MP rear-facing camera. You can use the 8MP selfie camera for video calls in full HD, but it has no 4K option. There&apos;s a 9,510mAh battery that supports 67W SuperVOOC fast charging to get the power you need to keep going.</p><p>You&apos;ll also find a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port, but the power button does not have a fingerprint sensor, nor is there an alert slider present like on many popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>. The 256GB of storage allows you to download several apps, but you can&apos;t expand it using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a>. You can also choose from 128GB and 512 GB storage options and either 8GB or 12GB RAM with UFS 3.1. The tablet has a Qualcomm Adreno GPU, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, and Bluetooth 5.4, but you won&apos;t find a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>The Google Pixel tablet has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Google Tensor G2</a> chip, two Cortex X 1 cores, four Cortex A55 cores, two Cortex A78 cores, and 8GB of RAM. Storage options include 128GB or 256GB UFS 3.1. The selfie camera features an 8MP f/2.0 aperture, and the rear-facing camera has an 8MP f/2.0 aperture. Regarding the video, you can record video using both cameras at 1080p and 30fps.</p><p>You can also count on USB Type-C 3.2; the four built-in speakers will play your favorite songs. However, the Wi-Fi 6 is a generation behind, but it also packs various sensors such as a Gyroscope, Ambient light sensor, Hall Sensor, Accelerometer, and Magnetometer. There is no monumental difference in the Bluetooth 5.2 features, and it should be suitable for basic use. Like its competitor, you won&apos;t find a headphone jack on the Pixel tablet.</p>

<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 comes with Oxygen 14.1 on top of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, but OnePlus promises three years of OS updates and four security updates. So you should be good at least until Android 17 rolls out. You get easily customizable tiles and can easily access split-screen multitasking by swiping with two fingers from the top of the display when using an app. Another good thing about the tablet is that it keeps bloatware to a minimum.</p><p>The Google Pixel Tablet launched with Android 13 but is upgradable to Android 14. Google has optimized many of its apps for the large displays on both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-hands-on">Pixel Fold</a> and Pixel Tablet. You&apos;ll find some useful features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, but you&apos;ll miss out on some other features that are available on Pixel phones.</p><p>You can also use Hub mode, which allows you to dock the tablet and treat it like a smart home hub, complete with controls for your smart devices. With Quick Share, you can easily share your videos, contacts, and images with family and friends. The Pixel Tablet will also get three years of software and five security updates.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for a more powerful tablet, the OnePlus Pad 2 is the one for you. However, if you love the Google ecosystem and love getting features before anyone else, Google is the way to go, as it sort of doubles as a smart home hub. The OnePlus Pad 2 is also the newer model, so it will be more expensive than the Pixel Tablet.</p><p>The Google Pixel Tablet costs $349 on Amazon, while the OnePlus Pad 2 sells for $550. So, the tablet you go with will depend on your budget and the specs you need. With the Pixel tablet, you get one more year of software updates than the Pad 2.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed that it's preparing to bring Gemini to Meet with a feature called "Take notes for me."</li><li>During a meeting, users will see a pencil icon, and clicking it will display the generated notes so far and a summary of what's transpired.</li><li>"Take notes for me" is similar to Google's previously rolled out Duet AI feature that could take notes, join meetings on your behalf, and capture video clips.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google alerted Workspace users to a new AI feature that&apos;ll help collect relevant information from a meeting for a recap.</p><p>As detailed in a Workspace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/take-notes-for-me-google-meet-admin-setting.html">blog post</a>, Google announced "Take notes for me," an AI-backed feature that automatically jots down the highlights. The company&apos;s AI model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, is responsible for the functionality. Additionally, after the talking is done, the AI&apos;s notes will be stored in the meeting owner&apos;s Drive or an "existing document in Calendar."</p><p>From there, the owner can likely dispatch the notes to all who were in the meeting or who may have missed it. The document owner can edit or delete anything Gemini captured and wrote down in its notes if needed, as well.</p><p>The feature isn&apos;t here yet; however, Google states admins can decide whether or not they will allow their users to utilize this AI feature. This can be done by hopping into <strong>Apps > Google Workspace > Google Meet > Gemini Settings.</strong></p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/14754931?hl=en">a subsequent post</a>, Google adds that users will find their AI-generated notes by hitting the starred pencil icon at the top of a meeting. The feature will show a quick blurb under "Summary so far," with a "latest update" divider to ensure users are caught up.</p><p>Google adds that despite the admin configuration option appearing now, those team leads can wait if they&apos;d like <em>everyone </em>to gain access simultaneously. The rollout of the AI-generated notes is set to begin on August 13 and be completed (hopefully) by August 21 for Workspace Labs users.</p><p>English-based Workspace customers with Gemini Enterprise Add-on, Education Premium add-on, or AI Meetings & Messaging add-on license are eligible for this feature.</p>

<p>What&apos;s interesting about this feature is that Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-duet-ai-for-meet">Duet AI in Meet</a> in late August last year. The Workspace app AI assistant could join meetings on behalf of the user to take notes or to convey messages you would&apos;ve said if you were there. After receiving a meeting invite, users could hit "attend for me," which would send the AI on its way.</p><p>After that, Duet AI would generate a text-based recap and capture video clips for participants. With the inclusion of Gemini in "Take notes for me," perhaps Google is giving it an alternative to Duet AI as the feature runs continuously for those who couldn&apos;t be there or who joined late.</p><p>More importantly, Google&apos;s listed start date is the same as the next hardware event on August 13. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-event-2024-live-blog-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-3-gemini-and-everything-else-we-expect-to-see">live blog is up and ready</a> as we expect the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel Watch 3, and much more regarding its AI Gemini.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Xiaomi's Smart Band 9 might come in colors like blue, silver, black, and pink, and will have various official accessories, including different strap styles.</li><li>The new straps use Xiaomi’s proprietary technology for a more secure fit, moving away from the old slot-over design.</li><li>The global version should have the same specs as the Chinese model, featuring a 1.62-inch AMOLED display, 233mAh battery (up to 21 days of use), and similar performance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Xiaomi rolled out the Smart Band 9 last month alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4 and Mix Flip smartphones in China</a>. Now, there&apos;s buzz about its global release coming soon.</p><p>Tipster Arsene Lupin stirred up talk on X (formerly Twitter) about the Xiaomi Smart Band 9 going global any day now.</p>

<p>The idea of a wider release is exciting, but Lupin didn&apos;t drop any details on when it&apos;s happening, so fans are left hanging for now.</p><p>According to the tip, the Smart Band 9 might launch globally in several colors, including blue, silver, black, and pink.</p>

<p>Along with color options, Lupin also shared images of the Smart Band 9 with a variety of official accessories. These include a dual-tone leather strap, two chain strap styles, a metal strap, a braided strap, and a classic single-color leather strap.</p><p>It&apos;s important to mention that these straps move away from the old slot-over design. Xiaomi&apos;s new proprietary band technology for the Smart Band 9 promises a more secure and integrated fit.</p><p>From the leaked specs on dimensions, display, sensors, and other features, it looks like the global version of the Smart Band 9 will be identical to the Chinese model.</p><p>Xiaomi&apos;s contender for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">top fitness trackers</a> this year features a 1.62-inch AMOLED display that can hit 1200 nits of peak brightness, making it highly readable in different lighting conditions. With a resolution of 192 x 490 pixels and a pixel density of 326 ppi, the screen delivers crisp and clear visuals.</p><p>The Smart Band 9 also packs a 233mAh battery, promising up to 21 days of use with the Always-On Display turned off. Otherwise, you can expect about nine days of battery life.</p><p>Originally launched in China for 249 yuan (around $35), the Smart Band 9 offers great value. Xiaomi has also introduced an NFC version and a premium ceramic special edition.</p><p>However, the leaked details notably lack any mention of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-next-evolution-of-nfc-will-let-you-do-more-with-a-single-tap">NFC connectivity</a>, a feature Xiaomi usually offers as an optional upgrade, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Leaker-reveals-state-of-Xiaomi-Smart-Band-9-global-release-with-specs-and-accessories-shown-but-no-NFC-model.873886.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>. Given this and the fact that the previous Smart Band 8 didn&apos;t include an NFC variant globally, it’s likely Xiaomi might leave out this feature from the global release of the Smart Band 9 as well.</p>

<ul><li>While we wait on One UI 6.1.1, it was discovered that Samsung improved its app mirroring capabilities on Android.</li><li>Samsung simplifies the experience by removing the constant need for approval before Link to Windows can mirror an app to a computer.</li><li>Only Samsung's recent foldables have One UI 6.1.1 as the rest of its cast awaits the major AI update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Windows and Android have had a comfortable app streaming relationship for a while, but it seems Samsung is improving that foundation.</p><p>According to a deep dive conducted by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-6-1-1-streaming-apps-windows-3469490/">Android Authority</a>), Samsung&apos;s One UI 6.1.1 software takes app streaming to a new level. A user must give permission to Link to Windows and the Phone Link to stream an app on their computer. Rahman&apos;s findings show that Samsung has "migrated" those necessary services into Android&apos;s purpose-built implementation.</p><p>This creates the opportunity for a streamlined experience when streaming an app to Windows since that permission page only appears once. Rahman showed that users are given the approval screen when initially attempting to stream an app. Your device will produce "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Link to Windows</a>" permission page for phone information (your apps) followed by the mirroring page.</p><p>It&apos;s there that users can set whether or not they should allow mirroring "always," "only this time," or "don&apos;t allow."</p><p>Tapping "always allow" will remove that constant permissions acceptance prompt from appearing. However, it&apos;s required that your Android device remain on and not off (locked).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1052px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.03%;"><img id="gqtjgqEjZ2TXB5XAc4Ea9e" name="samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-windows-link-change.jpg" alt="Samsung's One UI 6.1.1 software improves the Link to Windows experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqtjgqEjZ2TXB5XAc4Ea9e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1052" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before, users were required to constantly approve an app to be streamed from their Android device to their computer. It was unnecessarily monotonous, but this small migration should alleviate that. Rahman adds that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a> have this capability, considering those are the only devices with the next iteration of the software.</p><p>Microsoft detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-phone-link-announcement">a huge revamp for Phone Link</a> that switched the app&apos;s name from "Your Phone." Users were given a much cleaner look at <em>everything </em>involving their phone on their computer, like their messages and other notifications. Minimizing the new sidebar offers an intuitive experience when receiving new notifications. That announcement arrived a few months after Windows 11  launched, which brought even more UI changes for those users.</p><p>With only Samsung&apos;s recent foldables having access to One UI 6.1.1, the rest of its Galaxy portfolio <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-devices-confirmed">is still waiting on it</a>. Speculation guessed it would arrive before the summer, but now we&apos;re nearly midway through August and there&apos;s still no word. The software is expected to bring loads of AI improvements across the board.</p><p>Samsung confirmed as much on its community forum, stating users can expect new AI-backed camera features like Portrait Studio and Sketch to Image. Additionally, the weight of One UI 6.1.1 has reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delay-one-ui-6-1-1-ai">delayed the arrival of One UI 7</a> (Android 15) in its beta and stable capacities.</p>

Below, we’ll break down all the most important leaks and things we hope to see. Then, during the main event, we’ll chime in with our thoughts on everything Google has revealed about its 2024 Pixels!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-live-stream"><span>Live stream</span></h3>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_y2tP9of8A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Long-time Pixel users might be excited by this blast from the past: Google reportedly plans to bring back “XL” devices! After the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review-one-month-later"><u>Pixel 4 XL</u></a> — which Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda had a “love-hate relationship” with in 2019 — you’ve been stuck with whatever size Google chose.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl-leaked-hands-on-video"><u>leaked on TikTok</u></a>, and even before that, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-pixel-9-leak-ruins-the-suspense-ahead-of-googles-big-event"><u>Google promo leak</u></a> suggested that the Pixel 9 Pro would ship in 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch sizes. Phones aside, Google allegedly wants to sell a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-xl-renders"><u>Pixel Watch 3 XL</u></a>, so you can choose between 1.2- and 1.4-inch displays.</p><p>We hope this rumor ends up being true at the Made by Google event; fans of smaller phones will appreciate having all the bells and whistles, with extra display space as optional. The small size of the Pixel Watch 2 was one of our only complaints about the Android watch, as well.</p>
<p>We at Android Central don’t endorse turning Made by Google into a drinking game (it’s five o’clock somewhere but definitely not in Mountain View). But if you took a shot every time they say  “Gemini” tomorrow, you’d probably die.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMVpP-Zam1A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google introduced the Pixel 9 Pro in the promo video above, but a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini"><u>Gemini</u></a> generative AI demo takes center stage, and the glimpse of the Pixel 9 Pro’s new camera bar is surrounded by an “Oh hi, AI” quote. It’s clear Google will try to stand out from iPhones and Galaxy phones by going all-in on Gemini, for better or worse.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-to-have-nifty-freebies"><u>recent leak</u></a> suggested Google will give a free year of Google One AI Premium ($20/month) for all Pixel 9 buyers, plus Fitbit Premium and YouTube Premium trial runs. But will new AI tricks tempt Pixel 8 Pro buyers to upgrade? </p>
<p>Our biggest question with the new Pixel 9 series is the Tensor G4 CPU. Google’s Samsung LSI-made chips have always prioritized AI and camera performance compared to Snapdragon’s raw power, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review"><u>Pixel 8 Pro</u></a> and older models frequently overheating.</p><p>An alleged Google insider claimed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-minimalistic-upgrade-report"><u>Tensor G4 will have middling Cortex cores</u></a> and a new layout designed to improve cooling performance. While it could have a new modem with satellite connectivity, the GPU would remain unchanged.</p><p>While this rumor has some Android Central staffers planning to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors"><u>wait for the Pixel 10</u></a>, we assume that Google’s <em>NPU</em> for AI tricks and camera processing will be industry-leading. So even though the Tensor G4 benchmarks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-tensor-g4-benchmark-test-scores-details"><u>only give a “slight boost” over the G3</u></a>, some Pixel 8 owners may still want to upgrade.</p>
<p>That same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-massive-pixel-9-leak-ruins-the-suspense-ahead-of-googles-big-event"><u>Pixel 9 Pro leak</u></a> suggests it’ll have a 42MP selfie camera and a triple rear camera array: a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP telephoto lens. At first glance, all three rear sensors are the same as the Pixel 8 Pro’s, but Google could easily upgrade in other areas like exposure, zoom, or AI tricks. </p><p>Still, if you’re a fan of selfies, that might be the main reason to get excited about the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>One other 8 Pro to 9 Pro upgrade: You’ll allegedly have the chance to pay extra for 16GB, 4GB more than previous flagships. That could make stomaching another year of average Tensor speeds a little more bearable.</p>
<p>What about the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review"><u>Pixel Fold</u></a>, you ask? Our staff is chock-full of foldable nerds excited to see what Google has in store, especially after Google showed us a glimpse of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in another Gemini-infused promo video last month.</p><p>Why call it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-confirms-the-pixel-9-pro-fold-is-real-in-official-tease"><u>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</u></a> instead of the Pixel Fold 2? It’s mostly a marketing choice, we’d guess; it makes it easier to group all the phones into one family on billboards or in commercials. Plus, it allegedly has the same 6.3-inch cover display you get with the standard Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>At first glance, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold switched its camera bar for a square with two tiers of camera sensors, and the unfolded display looks a bit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-square-shape-display-rumors"><u>more square-shaped</u></a> than its predecessor.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC_A3EHFKF4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Curious what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-color-variants-leak"><u>Pixel 9 colors</u></a> you can expect this year? Leaks suggest that all Pixel models and sizes will ship in Obsidian or Porcelain. Specifically, the 9 Pro could come in Rose and Hazel finishes, while the base Pixel 9 supposedly has similar (but distinct) Pink and Green colors. The Pro Fold will only have Obsidian and Porcelain, supposedly; Google must think foldable fans hate anything colorful.</p><p>As far as we know, the Pixel 9 Pro XL will have the same color options, though interestingly, the TikTok leak suggests the XL will have a glossier finish, while the standard 9 and Pro will look more matte.</p>
<p>We haven’t talked much yet about the standard Pixel 9, but that might actually sport the most exciting upgrades for more frugal shoppers.</p><p>According to that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-google-pixel-9-series-promo-material-design-specs-ai-features/"><u>91Mobiles</u></a> leak, it’ll jump to 12GB of RAM, with a 50MP main camera, 10.5MP selfie cam, and 48MP ultrawide cam. That’s 4GB extra memory and 4X the UW resolution compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review"><u>Pixel 8</u></a>, though the other cameras might remain unchanged, and you’re still not getting a telephoto lens.</p><p>Plus, of course, you’re getting a 6.3-inch display, the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review"><u>Pixel 7</u></a> before Google shrunk it last year. And it’ll have all the same Tensor chip and Gemini AI tricks for a few hundred less than the Pro.</p>
<p>Enough about phones! Let’s talk the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3"><u>Pixel Watch 3</u></a>: Google hasn’t revealed it early like the Pixel 9 series, but we’re all but certain it’ll make an appearance after so many leaks about it and the new XL version.</p><p>Google’s choice to move Made by Google up two months makes the Pixel Watch series more compelling. Up until now, Galaxy Watches got new Wear OS upgrades months before Pixel Watches, even though Google makes the software. Now, even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review"><u>Galaxy Watch 7</u></a> got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5"><u>Wear OS 5</u></a> first, the Pixel Watch 3 won’t be so far behind.</p><p>Back in May, Google announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces"><u>Wear OS 5 fitness features</u></a> like running form analysis and better battery efficiency during workouts. They also promised new watch faces with different “Flavors” to let you put your own colorful spin on them. Aside from this, we don’t know what other software tricks the Pixel Watch 3 will bring, though that Gemini buzzword is a good guess.</p>
<p>According to leaks, the Pixel Watch 3 will have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-performance-display-rumored-details"><u>same CPU, MCU, and RAM</u></a> as the Pixel Watch 2. We don’t think Qualcomm has made a new Snapdragon W5 chip yet, and it’s still on the cutting-edge in terms of performance speed for Android watches.</p><p>The main downside is that we’ll probably see similar battery life as the Pixel Watch 2 last year: 24 hours with always-on display active. That’s not <em>terrible</em> compared to, say, an Apple Watch, but plenty of watches like the OnePlus Watch 2R and TicWatch Pro 5 can last three days per charge now, and the Galaxy Watch 7 is closer to two days (without AOD).</p>
<p>The leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-leaks-again-in-promo-video"><u>Pixel Watch 3 XL</u></a> is going to grab the most attention. Like Google’s XL phones, its only difference is its display size; it’ll have the same specs otherwise. We <em>love</em> the Pixel Watch 2’s edge-to-edge design, but did find the small display and large bezel somewhat limiting. Now it appears both Watch 3’s will have a smaller display border, plus doubled brightness and a faster refresh rate.</p>
<p>Need some new wireless earbuds? We’re pretty darn certain the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-leaked-ad-design"><u>leaked Pixel Buds Pro 2</u></a> will make an egg-shaped appearance. </p><p>We really liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review"><u>Pixel Buds Pro</u></a>, so we hope the Pro 2 continues in that vein. We don’t know much about them, except that they’re likely to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-gemini-capabilities-spotted"><u>hands-free Gemini conversations</u></a>, the case could have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-2-charging-case-spotted"><u>slight battery capacity increase</u></a>, and you’ll see some florid new colors like Raspberry, Haze, and Mojito.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing we haven’t talked much about: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15"><u>Android 15</u></a>. It’s been in public beta since April and reached platform stability this summer; it’ll launch alongside the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>Google <em>might</em> talk about some of its useful tricks, like Notification Cooldown, partial screen recording, better multitasking and a persistent taskbar on foldables, and a laundry list of other features that are more functional than snazzy. But we expect Google will breeze by these to focus more on Gemini, as it did at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements"><u>Google I/O 2024</u></a>. </p><p>It’s honestly a bit of a shame that Google hasn’t treated Android as an exciting OS on its own merits since Android 12 (aside from AI stuff).</p>
<p>What does Google have in store for us with Gemini? We’ll no doubt see some new Gemini extensions connecting to other Google products, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-home-extensions-spotted"><u>Google Home</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-inner-workings-code"><u>Spotify</u></a>. </p><p>We could also see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-app-beta-gemini-lock-screen-ai-detailed"><u>Gemini Live Background mode</u></a>, which will show useful information on your Pixel 9 Pro lock screen like Flights, Hotels, or YouTube info without having to unlock your phone.</p>

<p><strong>G. asks:</strong></p><p><em><strong>I&apos;ve never used a Chromebook before but I think I&apos;m interested in changing that. I&apos;m looking for something affordable (under $800), durable, travel-friendly, with great battery life.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I like to draw, binge-watch series, and stream movies. I also do lots of sporadic web browsing so I may have multiple browser tabs open (usually a dozen or fewer). One of the main reasons I mention battery life is that I travel a lot. I&apos;m not much of a gamer but I do play light or moderate games sometimes.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just want something that can handle all this (and hopefully more). I&apos;ve read reviews and seen videos and even asked people online and in person, and what I gather is that one of the newer Acer models would work for me. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I&apos;m still not sure. Why is this so hard?!</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi there, G.! I paraphrased your question a bit, so it&apos;s better formatted for the web, but I am <em>so</em> glad you wrote in and asked. This is hard. It&apos;s good, but it&apos;s hard because there is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">so much stuff out there to choose from</a>.</p><p>I like to give a quick answer for anyone searching before I talk more about anything, so here&apos;s what I think might work best for you:</p>
<p>You mentioned the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2023-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-chromebook-spin-714-review">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</a> (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJH9LGK8">older model</a> with its own stylus that doesn&apos;t use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/13/game_raptor_intel/">flawed Intel CPU</a>) and it&apos;s the Chromebook that leaps to my mind based on everything you&apos;re looking for. It has a great screen, excellent stylus support, plenty of ports, and good battery life. No Chromebook is great at gaming, but a model with an Intel core CPU can play some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/play-steam-games-chromebook">light Steam games</a>. For what you mention you need it fits the bill while still coming in under your price point.</p><p>But I also have to ask if you&apos;ve considered a tablet. An iPad Air or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9</a> is going to be better than a Chromebook when it comes to drawing, portability, and battery life. Of course, you don&apos;t have access to a desktop web browser like you would in a Chromebook and you&apos;re limited to mobile games. Either will also meet your set budget.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="HjSE9hHHy9vdAZVrycrBqX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-s-pen-angled.jpg" alt="Writing on Galaxy Tab S9 FE with S Pen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjSE9hHHy9vdAZVrycrBqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The point is that it&apos;s incredibly difficult to find a single device that can meet all of our needs, but there are usually choices out there that can come really close. In your case, you&apos;re not looking for something to use for office work or school work, prioritize usability over specs, and aren&apos;t trying to find some sort of tech unicorn that can do crazy things.</p><p>You want something good at the normal things a lot of us want out of our devices. Your needs are a lot like my own — I need to be able to work using the web browser, I want my battery to last, I love to kick back and stream a show or a movie, and I like to draw once in a while. I&apos;m still using an ancient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook-3-months-later" target="_blank">Google Pixelbook,</a> and whenever I think about upgrading, I notice I&apos;m flooded with good choices. Then I give up because I&apos;m worried I&apos;ll make the wrong choice and complain that my Pixelbook battery isn&apos;t up to snuff.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you have to decide what&apos;s right for you and live with how you spend your money. I gave you a few quick, easy choices, but that&apos;s a lot more to consider: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-chips-are-going-make-chromebooks-even-better">ARM Chromebooks</a> have better app compatibility (important for gaming and drawing) and battery life, and tablets suck to type on and have a far worse web browser but are better than Chromebooks in some areas important to you, etc., etc.</p><p>One thing I think you absolutely should do is take the time to see these devices in person. Visit a store like Best Buy and see what&apos;s on display that you can play with for a bit to see if there is something you <strong>don&apos;t</strong> like.</p>
<p>In the end, I think you would be happy with either the Acer Spin 714 or the iPad Air/Galaxy Tab S9. If you want to stop trying to choose and start having fun, either is the way to go.</p><p>If you want to keep looking so you know you made the very best choice you could make, you&apos;re not alone. Having so many things to choose from makes this a really hard decision.</p>

This economy-level tablet features 64GB of storage and a microSD slot for those who need more. It also comes with a headphone jack, a 10.4-inch LCD screen, and a lightweight, simple design.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't call the S6 Lite one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a>, but it's enough to get the job done for most casual users. With an extra $110 off, Amazon has made this cheap tablet even more appealing to those who want a deal and don't need peak performance. The major selling points for the S6 Lite include its impressively long battery life, the inclusion of the Samsung S Pen, and its lightweight, minimal design.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-geek-squad-certified-refurbished-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-10-4-64gb-oxford-gray/6500284.p?skuId=6500284" target="_blank">Best Buy - $229.99</a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-S6-Lite-2020-10-4-Tablet-64GB-Wi-Fi-S-Pen-Included-Oxford-Gray/769699649" target="_blank">Walmart - $209.98</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Included-Expandable-Exclusive/dp/B0CWS8MNW1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="71abcffc-5c93-4d6a-9c50-2403e8e53cdc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 64GB: $329.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 64GB: $329.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>battery life is a major selling point for you; you want a good deal on a tablet that also comes with the Samsung S Pen; you&apos;re looking for something with at least 64GB of storage and the option to expand that.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you think you may be better off just going with an iPad; you require a tablet with industry-leading performance.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-review">Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite</a> features the same size battery as the company&apos;s regular Galaxy Tab S6, but the lower-resolution display and other less power-intensive hardware give the S6 Lite superb battery life. This model comes with 64GB of storage on its own, as well as expandable storage of up to 512GB with the use of the microSD slot. The included S Pen also magnetically attaches to the side of the tablet, which is just plain old fun.</p><p>To be sure, the S6 Lite isn&apos;t a premium-level tablet, as evidenced by the general latency you&apos;ll experience when switching from one app to the next or trying to run games. Still, if you&apos;re a casual tablet user and you&apos;re just looking for something cheap, this deal might not be a bad option for you.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube has a new feature for Premium users in the testing phase.</li><li>Dubbed Sleep Timer, it works similarly to what we have seen on the YouTube Music app.</li><li>It allows users to pause the playback after a certain period of time, ranging from 10 minutes to one hour.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A sleep timer in an app is a lifesaver, especially for media apps. While plenty of music apps already have this handy feature, Google is now experimenting with it for YouTube.</p><p>The feature is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">currently available</a> for YouTube Premium subscribers and works similarly to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> app. Users can select any random video on YouTube, hit play, and head to the little settings icon where they can find the new "Sleep timer" option.</p>

<p>Digging in further gives them a few options, like the ability to select several minutes ranging from 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. You can also sync it up with the video&apos;s run time.</p><p>This new feature is especially handy for those who love to watch videos or stream playlists before bed—it’s perfect if you tend to doze off mid-play. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/09/youtube-is-now-testing-a-built-in-sleep-timer-but-only-with-premium-subscribers/">9to5Google notes</a>, the best part is that it won’t mess up your watch history or mess with future recommendations from the platform.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the feature is currently experimental, and YouTube allows Premium subscribers to test it out until September 2.</p><p>You can find this feature on both the mobile and web versions of the platform. If the feedback is good—and it probably will be, given how useful this feature is—it’s likely to roll out for everyone soon.</p><p>YouTube has been testing several new features lately, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-tests-less-disruptive-mid-roll-ads">most recent one</a> being intended to help creators serve up less disruptive ads. The service is experimenting with picture-in-picture (PiP) mid-roll ads, where the content shrinks into PiP mode while the ad takes over most of the screen—or possibly the reverse. You can spot this new option under "Monetization" in the Live Control Room.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung reportedly delayed its One UI 7 beta rollout last month, and now, the delays are set to impact the upgrade's official rollout.</li><li>The new reports say that the rollout has been "delayed indefinitely" and there isn't even a concrete beta testing schedule for the Android 15-based One UI 7.</li><li>The news comes following an earlier report that Google is likely to ship the Pixel 9 series with Android 14, not Android 15.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung typically releases new One UI updates, which are based on the latest version of Android, in the fall for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a>. However, if the reports are any indication, Samsung&apos;s development and testing of One UI 7 haven&apos;t gone according to plan. We expected to see official information, and perhaps a beta, for One UI 7 at the end of last month. Instead, we got nothing, and now the situation appears to be getting worse.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/07/samsung-android-15-update-delay/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, two reliable Android tipsters are now saying that One UI 7 is delayed, and the public rollout could be affected. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1820356963714335226" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a> said "there are still no plans to launch it in the near future." By comparison, the One UI 6 beta rolled out to the Galaxy S23 series in the U.S. and a few other regions around this time last year.</p>

When we first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-has-allegedly-put-the-brakes-on-the-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">reported on the apparent One UI 7 beta delay in late July</a>, it was thought that Samsung was prioritizing One UI 6.1.1 development ahead of One UI 7. Or, that instability issues with One UI 7 were holding things up. Now, it&apos;s unclear what exactly is the cause for Samsung&apos;s delay.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Has been delayed indefinitely last week<a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1820488203679445482">August 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The good news for Samsung is that it isn&apos;t the only company delaying the release of Android 15. Google&apos;s Pixel and earlier Nexus brands have typically ushered in new versions of Android. However, that might be changing this year. Reports indicate that the four new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> series phones launching at the Made by Google event this week will ship with Android 14, not Android 15. That big update will come later in a shocking move, if the leaks are correct.</p><p>Of course, the delay somewhat makes sense for Google. Although the Android 15 beta is nearing the platform stability stage of development, we have to remember that the Pixel 9 series is launching a whole two months earlier than usual. That would explain why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> isn&apos;t ready for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. </p><p>Still, this sets up a situation where both Google and Samsung are releasing their software updates on an abnormal timetable, and it&apos;s going to affect consumers and the market in a real way.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-from-google-and-samsung-apos-s-schedule-shifts-2">Key takeaways from Google and Samsung&apos;s schedule shifts</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2nvETLDpK7ckzSSrSsXF5" name="android-14-logo-samsung-4.jpg" alt="Android 14 logo on a Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2nvETLDpK7ckzSSrSsXF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google and Samsung both promised seven years of software updates with the Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24 series, respectively. Presumably, the companies will at least match that going forward. But what happens if Android 15 ships behind schedule? Google would need to give the Pixel 9 series <em>eight</em> full OS upgrades to match the support it gave the Pixel 8. There&apos;s no way calling the jump from Android 14 to Android 15 a month or two after the Pixel 9 releases as "a full OS upgrade" will fly well with buyers.</p><p>Samsung might not be affected by this predicament if it gets its One UI 7 development in order. One UI 6 debuted in October 2023, roughly three months before the Galaxy S24 series debuted in January of this year. As long as Samsung manages to get its Android 15-based update ready before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineup launches, it could avoid chaos. It looks like Google might be in for a sticky situation, though.</p><p>For Google, the rumored choice to ship the Pixel 9 lineup with Android 14 is a big shift in strategy. The company&apos;s own Android phones have always been the standard for "stock Android," sometimes to a fault. But it&apos;s leaving that behind. Pixels are far from stock Android nowadays, since they&apos;re full of Pixel-exclusive features and now Google AI tools. Google is treating the Pixel brand like any other Android brand, and the culmination of that is breaking up the ties between new Android releases and new Pixel releases. </p><p>For Samsung, the delays to One UI 7 development appear to continue for a rough few weeks for the company&apos;s mobile and wearable teams. The company faced criticism for its new Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Buds 3 releases, which were not-so-subtly inspired by Apple products. More importantly, there are quality control issues, delayed release dates, and product availability concerns that are still being worked out. A significant delay to One UI 7 would be another black mark on Samsung&apos;s record. </p><p>Finally, the delays to both Android and Google&apos;s Android 15 updates underscore the feebleness of Android updates in general. We see missed targets and long waits for software upgrades in the Android world all too often. Recently, Motorola took a full year to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">give the Razr+ (2023) an Android 14 update</a>. For some, the lack of consistency in Android updates is just another thing pushing them to the iPhone.</p>

<p>It looks like OnePlus might be dropping its highly anticipated flagship earbuds as soon as this week.</p><p>Tipster Yogesh Brar spilled the beans on the OnePlus Buds Pro 3&apos;s unveiling. We’ve seen the specs from earlier leaks, but Brar hints that the launch might happen later this week.</p><p>As for the price, the latest tip suggests that OnePlus&apos; next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">flagship wireless earbuds</a> might hit the Indian market for Rs 13,999, though the final price is expected to be similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">Buds Pro 2</a>.</p>

<p>Brar didn’t mention any pricing information for the Western markets, but earlier leaks suggested the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 could be around €199 in Europe, or about $217 USD. That’s a €20 bump from earlier models.</p><p>OnePlus seems to be shaking things up with its new flagship earbuds. Leaked images show they’ll have a sleek dual-tone look, keeping some style from the current model.</p><p>The OnePlus Buds Pro 3’s charging case is supposedly getting a stylish upgrade with a faux leather finish. Leaked images from Brar also reveal new left (L) and right (R) markings on the earbuds and a fresh white color option.</p>

<p>The Buds Pro 3 might also have an impressive battery life of up to 43 hours. Plus, with Bluetooth 5.4, you’ll get better connectivity and audio quality.</p><p>The earbuds will likely have the same driver setup as the previous model, with an 11mm woofer and a 6mm tweeter in each earbud. But don’t fret about audio upgrades—OnePlus might be working with Dynaudio to fine-tune the sound. Plus, noise cancellation is expected to get a boost, with up to 50dB of noise reduction.</p><p>The earbuds are said to upgrade to LHDC 5.0 codec technology, moving beyond the LHDC 4.0 found in the Buds Pro 2.</p><p>Earlier leaks also revealed that the Buds Pro 3 will boast an IP55 rating for water and dust resistance.</p>
