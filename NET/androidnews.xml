<ul><li>Google states it will start "gradually rolling out" 911 texting capabilities through RCS on Android later "this winter."</li><li>Users can soon text 911 emergency services and see when they begin responding while also sending images and videos to help them.</li><li>This feature will join the likes of Fall and Crash Detection on Android.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is bringing a useful emergency services feature to Messages that lets users contact the appropriate authorities through RCS.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/messages/google-messages-rcs-911-emergency/">press release</a>, Google has partnered with RapidSOS to bring 911 texting capabilities to Messages through RCS-enabled chats. Contacting data centers through this method will let users "confirm the delivery" of their emergency requests and see when authorities are actively responding to them. Google hopes this removes the guesswork when it comes to wondering if 911 received your text.</p><p>Moreover, RCS-enabled chats allow users to send high-quality images and videos to 911, which could help them understand your situation better. Lastly, location sharing becomes possible through Google&apos;s partnership with RapidSOS as SMS texts, the old way of texting authorities, didn&apos;t have this capability.</p><p>Data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shows that only 53% of 911 centers in the U.S. can accept text messages as communication.</p><p>Google announced today (June 6) that it will bring its RCS to 911 feature to "every 911 agency in the United States" for free. Companies involved are said to begin rolling out this new feature to call centers across the States later "this winter."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rapidsos.com/unite/">RapidSOS</a> recently debuted many new features designed to tackle public safety involving messaging, multimedia, and its HARMONY AI copilot for emergency response.</p><p>Brian Fontes, president of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) stated, "For too long we&apos;ve asked our first responders to manage millions of emergencies with little more than voice connection. I&apos;m excited to see the paradigm be transformed for 911 agencies across the United States."</p>

<p>On the other hand, Google adds that it will continue to hone its efforts to improve access to emergency centers through RCS. The company has hopes to make RCS the "standard for emergency services everywhere."</p><p>This new capability will arrive for Android devices later this year, with Google&apos;s eyes set on the winter season.</p><p>As most message users might be aware, RCS helps keep texts private between us and the other person. With this modern texting solution joining 911 centers for emergency communications, Google sees this as a way of building upon our security and personal safety. The company has already rolled out other features to connect Android users to the authorities, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-enable-fall-detection-pixel-watch">Fall Detection</a> on the Pixel Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-car-crash-detection-pixel-4">Crash Detection</a> on Pixels.</p>

<p>Google has revealed that Chrome is now 72% faster, achieving its highest score ever in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-google-microsoft-and-firefox-have-a-new-browser-benchmark-to-rule-them-all">latest Speedometer 3 browser benchmark</a>.</p><p>To measure how fast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> is, Google uses a mix of its own tests and industry-standard benchmarks. Speedometer 3 is a popular tool for comparing browser speeds because it closely mimics real-world usage. Google&apos;s blog post explains the recent improvements that have made Chrome faster than ever since Speedometer 3 debuted.</p><p>Google examined which functions in Speedometer were slowing down the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> the most and made specific tweaks to speed them up. For example, it improved the function that handles space-separated strings, making it faster by removing unnecessary checks. Google also made sure that duplicate stylesheets were only processed once, saving time and resources.</p><p>Other changes include optimizing memory usage when drawing shapes and reducing unnecessary processing when creating form elements. The team also identified commonly used selectors in "querySelector" and streamlined them for better performance.</p><p>Last year, Google made several changes to reach a Speedometer score of 390 in Chrome version 113. This included faster HTML parsing and updates to the DOM, benefiting not just Chrome but also Apple&apos;s WebKit browsers. Google extended some of these optimizations to improve other functions used by Speedometer 3.</p><p>Additionally, Google worked with the Harfbuzz maintainer to improve how Chrome renders fonts used by Apple macOS. This change speeds up text processing by quickly determining which glyphs need to be processed.</p><p>One key strategy for Google&apos;s performance improvements is code tiering, which involves selecting the right code to optimize further. Intel helped by contributing a method that remembers past optimization decisions so Chrome can apply them more quickly in the future.</p><p>While performance is important for a smooth web browsing experience, many users often complain about Chrome&apos;s high memory usage rather than its speed. Chrome&apos;s fast script running can take up a lot of memory, but this isn&apos;t entirely Chrome&apos;s fault as these scripts require significant resources to operate effectively.</p><p>In any case, these scores are expected to keep improving as Google continues to enhance its browser.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> makers have had a rough time of late, receiving backlash for their right-to-repair policies. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ifixit-breakup-highlights-google-efforts">Samsung came under fire</a> in late May for a leaked contract with independent repair shops that required them to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leaked-samsung-contract-user-data-device-disassembly">disassemble phones with aftermarket parts</a>. More recently, a clause in Google&apos;s <strong>Service & Repair Program Terms & Conditions</strong> added in July 2023 surfaced that may have been even more alarming. If you sent a phone to Google for repair with aftermarket parts, per the old rules, that phone might not get sent back to you. </p><p>Google has since adjusted its terms and conditions, but we saved a screenshot showing exactly what the old policy stated: </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f7HiRy2cAchLHdeRW67R7Y" name="Google-Repair-Terms-Old.jpg" alt="The old Google repair terms and condition." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7HiRy2cAchLHdeRW67R7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let&apos;s get this out of the way first: Google already removed this clause from the terms and conditions after the negative feedback from users and the press alike. However, based on the old rules, it was entirely possible for Google to confiscate a Pixel phone sent in for repair with aftermarket parts. It&apos;s one thing for the company to deny repair services to phones that have been tinkered with, but it&apos;s another to keep the phone altogether. Unsurprisingly, the discovery of this clause by right-to-repair advocate and YouTuber Louis Rossmann sparked outrage. </p><p>Even now that Google did the right thing and changed the terms and conditions, the situation brought an interesting conversation to light. How do aftermarket parts fit into right-to-repair, and should companies like Google have to support them? </p>
<h2 id="was-google-really-confiscating-pixel-phones-with-aftermarket-parts-2">Was Google really confiscating Pixel phones with aftermarket parts?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cXEB439oaon94xMb7dx2fS" name="android-15-dark-mode-pixel-8-pro-pixel-fold.jpg" alt="A Google Pixel 8 Pro and Google Pixel Fold using Android 15's dark mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cXEB439oaon94xMb7dx2fS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For starters, there&apos;s a difference between having a contract clause and acting on it. As far as we know, there aren&apos;t any customer reports of Google keeping a phone sent in for repair with aftermarket parts. For what it&apos;s worth, Google denies that it has ever kept Pixel phones with aftermarket parts.</p><p>"If a customer sends their Pixel to Google for repair, we would not keep it regardless of whether the phone has non-OEM parts. In certain situations, we won&apos;t be able to complete a repair, such as if there are safety concerns," Google explained in a statement to multiple media outlets on Tuesday, June 4. "In that case, we will either send the phone back to the customer or work with them to determine the next steps. Customers are also free to seek the repair options that work best for them. We are updating our Terms and Conditions to clarify this."</p><p>Another interesting tidbit is that Google&apos;s repair rules vary by country and region, which might not be that surprising. The U.S. is notably behind other regions, specifically the E.U., in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-right-to-repair-stance">right-to-repair laws and regulations</a>. While the company&apos;s terms and conditions authorized it to keep phones with aftermarket parts in the U.S.,  it did not say the same in E.U. countries. </p><p>Google moved rather swiftly to update its terms and conditions for repair services. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/device-repair/" target="_blank">updated document</a>, which says it is effective as of June 6, removes the controversial clause. Instead, the same subsection about aftermarket parts says the following: </p><p>"If you send a device containing non-Google-authorized parts for repair, in certain situations (e.g., safety), the service provider may not be able to repair your device. Service Provider will return Your Device except when health or safety requirements prevent us from doing so. If the service provider can’t return Your device, Google will work with you on the next steps."</p><p>This seems reasonable enough, but it still leaves Pixel users with unauthorized parts out in the cold. Is that really a problem, though?</p>
<h2 id="aftermarket-parts-are-crucial-to-keeping-old-products-alive-2">Aftermarket parts are crucial to keeping old products alive</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="hiMGTFU6QPj8YTjDAGaFc7" name="google-pixel-2-battery-life-screen.jpg" alt="Pixel 2 battery estimate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hiMGTFU6QPj8YTjDAGaFc7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a solid partnership with iFixit, and that will allow consumers to buy genuine parts for their Pixel for some time. Usually, this will match the devices&apos; software support, which is now seven years old. However, after OEM parts can no longer be purchased for a device, aftermarket parts become the only option for users to keep their products alive — especially for consumable parts, like batteries. Used, genuine screens can be used to repair broken ones, but a pre-owned battery won&apos;t do any good. </p><p>Aftermarket parts can also be more affordable than genuine ones, making independent repair more accessible to more people. They also help independent repair shops keep parts in stock and overcome purchase limits when they apply. Even manufacturers that are about right to repair may struggle to keep high-demand parts in stock at times, and aftermarket parts can serve as an alternative.</p><p>To sum up, aftermarket parts are an important part of the right-to-repair movement. If a very old Pixel phone needs a battery, for example, an aftermarket part may be the only option.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few giant problems with aftermarket parts. Google can&apos;t control what kinds of aftermarket parts are used, and to some degree, it doesn&apos;t know what problems they could cause after being installed in a Pixel phone. Google has everything to lose and nothing to gain by trying to repair a phone with unauthorized parts installed. Especially now that it sells genuine parts through iFixit, we can&apos;t fault it for not repairing Pixels with aftermarket parts. </p><p>The other problem is safety. When you buy an aftermarket battery, you really have no idea what kind of safety and quality control practices have been followed. At best, aftermarket batteries might have lower mAh capacities than expected, or deteriorate quicker than usual. At worst, a defective battery could start a fire and create a dangerous situation. Without proper validation, aftermarket parts can be dicey. </p><p>These problems need to be solved because aftermarket parts will be vital to the right-to-repair movement. Now that Google has amended its repair terms and conditions to return Pixels with aftermarket parts to users, it&apos;s doing its part. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Cryptic images and tweets from Nothing hint at a unique device, potentially featuring a screw mechanism for attaching accessories.</li><li>The device is potentially the first smartphone from Nothing's sub-brand, CMF, which is expected to include a 6.7-inch OLED display and MediaTek's Dimensity 7200 processor.</li><li>It's also rumored to retail for a base price of $249, with a potential launch in mid-July.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is known for its clever marketing, often getting people hyped up on social media with sneak peeks of upcoming products. In recent days, the company has been dropping hints about a new smartphone, which might be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-by-nothing-first-phone-rumors">first model from its sub-brand, CMF</a>.</p><p>On its official X account, Nothing posted a cryptic image of a device in development, featuring a conspicuous screw head on the back of a matte-finished device with a curved corner. The caption hints that a launch is taking place soon, but the unusual design in the image has everyone guessing what it could be.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3, 2, 1. pic.twitter.com/RKq6xSdnqT<a href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1797553590418264484">June 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Adding to the mystery, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1797597064232312860" target="_blank">follow-up X post</a> with phone and screw emojis suggests that this could actually be a new phone. Despite the speculation, Nothing remains tight-lipped about the details, fueling anticipation for the rumored CMF Phone 1. To date, CMF has released headphones, a smartwatch, and a charger.</p><p>Given the success of CMF&apos;s products, the launch of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-could-be-way-cheaper-than-nothings-budget-phones">new CMF smartphone seems plausible</a>.</p><p>A recent post on X offers further insights. According to user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/realMlgmXyysd/status/1797585279819403543" target="_blank">@realMlgmXyysd</a>, Nothing’s initial tweet references the “Nothing Lock,” a mechanism allowing users to attach various accessories to the phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/cmf-phone-1-leak-3448464/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Technerd_9/status/1797592952732368905" target="_blank">post</a> outlines potential specifications, including a 6.7-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 processor. Rumor has it the phone will come with a dual-camera setup featuring 50MP main and ultrawide lenses, plus a 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging.</p><p>The price is rumored to start at $249 for the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage model, with a potential launch in mid-July. However, until an official announcement is made, all details remain speculative.</p><p>It&apos;s unclear if these leaks and the teased image are real, but there&apos;s no denying the buzz around Nothing&apos;s cryptic hints. While a complex accessory system for a budget phone might seem improbable, Nothing has a knack for surprising us with its out-of-the-box thinking.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Elysian Acoustic Labs has a halo status in the enthusiast audio segment, and for good reason; the brand consistently delivers standout designs with exquisite sound quality. So when Elysian Acoustic Labs announced it was making IEMs that will retail for under $500, there was considerable interest. The brand&apos;s products cost five times as much, and its most affordable IEMs until now was the $1,699 Diva.</p><p>That&apos;s changing with the introduction of the Pilgrim. The IEMs retain Elysian Labs&apos; fanatical attention to detail and build quality, and they&apos;re easily one of the more distinctive IEMs you&apos;ll see in this segment. But what you&apos;ll like the most is the pricing; the Pilgrim is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hifigo.com/products/elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim">for $399 at audio retailers like HiFiGo</a>, and that is a terrific value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="78JexVhFAYrYP5j9ZRcD8a" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-4.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78JexVhFAYrYP5j9ZRcD8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design in particular is where the Pilgrim stands out considerably from the rest of the pack, so that&apos;s a good starting point. Most IEMs in this segment use resin-based shells, but the Pilgrim is made out of machined aluminum, and the sound nozzle is constructed out of stainless steel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CAKBMbGE9J3eLzhwE2nxoZ" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-3.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAKBMbGE9J3eLzhwE2nxoZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the choice of materials means the Pilgrim is built to last, and to the brand&apos;s credit, the IEMs look and feel like they should cost a lot more. A lot of that is down to the design of the faceplate; the reflective rings with the Elysian Labs logo nestled in the middle gives the IEMs plenty of design flair, and it definitely grabs attention. I didn&apos;t notice this in daily use, but the grooves in between the rings pick up a lot of dust — that was evident when taking photos of the product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4PNxRRUgjV4onGnS7Pstyb" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-10.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4PNxRRUgjV4onGnS7Pstyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I wasn&apos;t sure about the comfort of the IEMs given the metal chassis, but that isn&apos;t an issue in daily use. The sizing leans towards the larger side, but I didn&apos;t see any problems getting a snug fit, and the IEMs didn&apos;t cause any fatigue even with extended use. The rounded corners make a difference in this regard, and because of the way the sound nozzle is designed, you get really good isolation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RQfAi2xkBPF57iBwMZWbua" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-7.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQfAi2xkBPF57iBwMZWbua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there&apos;s the bundled cable. Elysian Labs includes a silver-plated copper cable with the Pilgrim, and it is excellent. It has a clear sheath covering the entire length of the cable — giving it better durability — and the only qualm I have with the cable is that it doesn&apos;t have a modular plug. You can choose a 3.5mm or 4.4mm connector when ordering the Pilgrim, but there&apos;s no way to change between the two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RZ4EmJSynSxDSJeMPktKvc" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-13.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RZ4EmJSynSxDSJeMPktKvc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the cable connects to the IEMs via Pentaconn plugs, and they jut out a bit. It would have been better to see a standard 2-pin system as that would have allowed the Pilgrim to be used with a wider selection of aftermarket cables, and the connector itself is fragile, so you&apos;ll need to be vigilant while plugging in the cable.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 1</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X73kAe3vvnhSb27YJnxSCZ" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-1.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X73kAe3vvnhSb27YJnxSCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Elysian Labs did a great job with the packaging as well, and you get a hard shell case to hold the Pilgrim when not in use. However, you just get three SpinFit silicone tips with the package, and that&apos;s not nearly adequate; I would have liked to see a greater selection of options given the asking price. That said, the bundled tips should provide a good fit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oMdywugYSgHcBkVgsS44La" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-5.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oMdywugYSgHcBkVgsS44La.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pilgrim uses a hybrid driver configuration that features a 9.2mm dynamic driver encased in a liquid silicone rubber shell that&apos;s designed to deliver better sub-bass, and it&apos;s joined by two sets of Sonion balanced armature drivers: the Sonion 2300 for the mids, and a pair of the brand&apos;s E50 drivers that handle the treble.</p>

<p>The sound tubes and acoustic chamber of the Pilgrim are crafted via 3D printing, and this allows the brand to deliver better consistency while manufacturing. With an impedance of just 9Ω and sensitivity of 101dB, the Pilgrim is incredibly easy to drive, and you don&apos;t need a powerful source to make the most out of the sound. I used it predominantly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">Fiio M23</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">M15S</a>, and you can use any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">dongle DAC</a> instead to drive the Pilgrim with your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PreXsoGmqxi6e6g9udgNdc" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-12.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PreXsoGmqxi6e6g9udgNdc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, what&apos;s immediately evident is the bass shelf; the Pilgrim has a distinct sub-bass boost, and you get a very noticeable rumble that&apos;s delightful. The IEMs pair very well with mainstream music, and if you&apos;re looking for a bass-heavy sound signature, it is one of the best in this segment. The exuberance doesn&apos;t extend as much to the mid-bass, but you still get excellent definition and clarity.</p><p>Thankfully, the bass extension doesn&apos;t influence the mids, and you get excellent clarity and detail retrieval. Vocals are clear and natural, but what&apos;s particularly great is just how good instruments sound — you can hear every nuance even in an ensemble setting.</p><p>The treble has good definition, and while it is a bit bright, there isn&apos;t noticeable sibilance. The soundstage is wide and inviting, and the Pilgrim nails the technical details; the tuning lends itself well to a lot of modern genres.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ExayjeYxNoQCecgGYvEZLd" name="elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-14.jpg" alt="Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExayjeYxNoQCecgGYvEZLd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, the Pilgrim looks and sounds like it should cost at least twice as much as its $399 retail price, and if you want high-quality IEMs with a distinctive bass-focused sound, it is a no-brainer. The minor quibbles — lack of a modular cable and limited accessories — ultimately don&apos;t make a difference, and the Pilgrim is now my go-to choice in the sub-$500 segment.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Digital audio players are a good choice if you want the versatility of Android and need something with easy portability. Obviously, a phone with a high-quality DAC and an audio jack — maybe even a 4.4mm port — would be ideal, and although Moondrop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moondrop-miad01-review">had the right idea with the MIAD01</a>, the software wasn&apos;t ideal, and as much as I enjoyed using that device, it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to a dedicated player.</p><p>So when Fiio said it was launching the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m11s-review">M11S</a>, I was interested. I have a lot of audio gear in the house, so I get the freedom to rotate between IEMs, headsets, and players pretty regularly. The M11S has been in constant use for the better part of a year, and the portability and sound quality made it the ideal device to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">stream Roon</a> when I&apos;m not at my desk.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6vRVNJhPCiSbH4kyW7MXEb" name="fiio-m23-5.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 runs vanilla Android 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6vRVNJhPCiSbH4kyW7MXEb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">K9 Pro</a> (and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>), the M11S was the Fiio product that got the most amount of use, and that mantle has now been taken over by the M23. At the outset, there isn&apos;t too much that&apos;s different; the M23 has the same glass-and-metal design as the M11S, and the controls are in the same location.</p><p>The key difference is the switch to AKM&apos;s AK4191EQ and AK4499EX DACs, and this allows the M23 to stand out a little. If that combination sounds familiar, it&apos;s because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q15-review">Q15 Bluetooth DAC</a> also uses the same AKM parts, along with a lot of the other audio hardware. Because of the upgrades, the M23 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-M23-Snapdragon-AK4191EQ-AK4499EX/dp/B0D14PGZV1">available for $699 on Amazon</a>, a $200 increase over the M11S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hEMyAv7228ivERSyQZ6qtb" name="fiio-m23-10.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 design has jagged lines" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEMyAv7228ivERSyQZ6qtb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, let&apos;s start with the design. Fiio didn&apos;t make too many changes in this area, and as such the M23 still has the same faceted edges and glass back. That said, the unit is noticeably larger thanks to a 5.5-inch panel and 5500mAh battery, and at 299g, it is 28g heavier than the M11S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CWZpspZADdv46aRz4P8d9Z" name="fiio-m23-16.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has 3.5mm and 4.4mm connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CWZpspZADdv46aRz4P8d9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there are several quality-of-life improvements. Fiio positioned the audio ports at the top, and it makes plugging in IEMs and headsets that much more convenient. There&apos;s no 2.5mm jack this time, with the M23 instead providing just the 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports, with each encircled by a ring, just like on the Q15.</p>

<p>The back is made out of glass, and it has a navy hue that looks rather nice and makes the M23 look very elegant. The unit is still a smudge magnet, and you will ideally need to use the bundled clear case to make the most of it. The playback controls are on the right, and they&apos;re joined by a Desktop Mode and Hold toggles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fUA3PgQd6qYeV2DMFxJMAa" name="fiio-m23-12.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has dual USB-C connectivity and a MicroSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fUA3PgQd6qYeV2DMFxJMAa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the bottom, you get the MicroSD slot, a USB-C port that allows you to connect the M23 to other sources, and a dedicated USB-C port for charging the device. This is nifty, as it allows you to use the standalone USB-C connection when charging the player.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cq7TwoDtzvmZHxXpFQDZwX" name="fiio-m23-11.jpg" alt="Side view of Fiio M23 showing the volume slider and power button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cq7TwoDtzvmZHxXpFQDZwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power button, volume slider, and multifunction button sit to the left, and Fiio switched out the usual volume buttons to a haptic option that&apos;s just not as good to use. It is very sensitive to minute changes, and inevitably triggers whenever I pick up the unit. Clearly, the brand knew about this issue, so it included the Hold toggle — which disables the volume slider. I don&apos;t see what was wrong with traditional volume buttons, and Fiio missed the brief in this regard.</p><p>Outside of that, the build quality is fantastic; the M23 is made out of aluminum — or steel, if you pick up that variant — and it is built to last. The M11S is still in pristine condition after a year of regular use, and the M23 has the same robust chassis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QvTekth8Exeunah2tuGrzc" name="fiio-m23-18.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 next to Fiio FA19" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QvTekth8Exeunah2tuGrzc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the panel, the M23 has a 5.5-inch 720p LCD screen with 60Hz refresh. It isn&apos;t anywhere close to the caliber of displays that you get on mid-range phones these days, but it is more than adequate in the context of a digital audio player. It has thin bezels, good colors, and I didn&apos;t have any issues in outdoor use, so it gets bright enough in auto mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z2J8onoUGw3zzuYFEDC8qY" name="fiio-m23-7.jpg" alt="All the usage modes available with the Fiio M23" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2J8onoUGw3zzuYFEDC8qY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, the interface doesn&apos;t have any customization and is fluid; Fiio took a vanilla Android build and added a lot of audio-focused features to it, while leaving the UI intact. You can choose between several modes — Android interface, a music mode that only enables Fiio Music, DAC mode, Bluetooth receiver, and so on. There&apos;s also the ability to adjust the gain between low, medium, and high, and you get Roon integration, another notable inclusion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YjFiJ74oZDDLYEaJCM5yUa" name="fiio-m23-15.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has controls on the right" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YjFiJ74oZDDLYEaJCM5yUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest addition this time is Desktop Mode; when enabled, the M23 relies solely on external power, so you can plug it into a desktop source and know that the built-in battery isn&apos;t going through the usual charge/discharge cycle. On that note, the 5500mAh battery lasts up to nine hours over the balanced port, and nearly 11 hours over the single-ended 3.5mm jack.</p>

<p>Charging the unit is easier as well, as it now uses the USB PD 30W standard. It takes just over an hour to get the battery up to 80%, but it takes another hour to hit the remaining 20%. That said, fast charging is a great addition, and I didn&apos;t see any issues with battery longevity.</p>

<p>My biggest quibble with the M23 is that it runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-10">Android 10</a> out of the box — that&apos;s just not good enough in 2024. I get that the unit doesn&apos;t have all the relevant phone bits, but it still comes with a full-fledged Android build and the Play Store, and it needs to be at least on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a>, if not switching to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> outright.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nZbADnvJr2Tyt3B7HgRbbc" name="fiio-m23-17.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 about page showing device info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nZbADnvJr2Tyt3B7HgRbbc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the hardware, the M23 uses the Snapdragon 660 and has 4GB of RAM along with 64GB of internal storage. You won&apos;t see anything as old as the Snapdragon 660 on a phone, but it works well enough on a digital audio player, and considering the effort Fiio put into optimizing the chipset, it&apos;s understandable that the manufacturer isn&apos;t willing to use Qualcomm&apos;s recent offerings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VAkPmoTEPqwWqTkXJ4qrdX" name="fiio-m23-3.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 next to Fiio FA19 and with music running" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VAkPmoTEPqwWqTkXJ4qrdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Fiio retained most of the same hardware, the sound characteristic of the M23 is noticeably different thanks to AKG&apos;s DACs and the use of THX AAA-78+ amps with a higher power output. The M23 hits 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and has DSD512 decoding, MQA, and a slate of audio codecs: SBC, AAC, AptX, AptX HD, LDAC, and LHDC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dPpiNCBT7eejf6SEbmQ2YY" name="fiio-m23-8.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 has adjustable gain" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPpiNCBT7eejf6SEbmQ2YY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It can deliver up to 1000mW of power over the balanced port at 32Ω, and that makes it a great choice to use with demanding planar headsets. I tested the M23 with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/moondrop-venus-review">Moondrop Venus</a>, and over a dozen of the best IEMs, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie200-review">Sennheiser IE200</a>, and FH15, and the audio player did a brilliant job with all connected devices.</p>
<p>The M23 retains Fiio&apos;s custom sound tuning, and you get a neutral soundstage with a little vibrancy in the mids. The bass has good definition and detail on the FT5, and it allows the fast transients of the planar headset to be that much more vibrant. The mids have a lot of character and dynamism, and ensemble instruments sound incredible. There&apos;s good treble extension, but you don&apos;t get any sibilance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pEVY5tGFhXxpnUSkQsi7pd" name="fiio-m23-19.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 volume slider in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEVY5tGFhXxpnUSkQsi7pd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At a technical level, the M23 hits all the right notes. The imaging and dynamics are spot-on — as is the case with most of Fiio&apos;s 2024 offerings — and if you want a neutral sound that lets you take full advantage of connected audio gear, the M23 is a standout choice in this segment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nwe8YuYcSLfDNjPe4EgfWZ" name="fiio-m23-2.jpg" alt="Fiio M23 connected to Fiio FA19" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwe8YuYcSLfDNjPe4EgfWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, it costs an additional $200 over the similarly-excellent M11S, and I really think Fiio should have updated the software. On the plus side, you get AKM&apos;s latest DAC, and the M23 is able to deliver higher power, so if you plan on using it with planar headsets, it is a better choice. But if you want to maximize value, the M11S is still a great value in 2024.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps Timeline is moving away from the web to the mobile app. Users will need to switch to the app to access their location history.</li><li>Google is giving its users time until 1 December to make the switch, after which most of their routes and visits will be auto deleted. </li><li>The company says that this switch will help users have more control over their data that will be stored on their device, rather than Google's servers.</li></ul>

<p>In its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">update</a>, Google stated that it will remove the Timeline feature on the web version of Google Maps. The timeline, originally named "location history," is a feature that lets you keep track of the places you&apos;ve visited and the routes traveled. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-view-your-location-history-google-maps">Timeline</a>, since 2015, has added the ability to collate images you&apos;ve taken at particular locations, giving you a better overview of all your travels.</p><p>In December 2023, Google changed where the location history was being stored. Users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default) will see Google Maps&apos; Timeline saved directly on their device rather than the web, giving them even more control over their data. </p><p>This means that if you access Google Maps on the web, the Timeline will not show any history about the places you&apos;ve visited. Instead, the company is pushing users to download the app and continue accessing the feature. </p><p>The tech giant states that to keep their old Timeline data and continue storing new information, users need to update to the most recent version of Maps, follow the instructions, which they will receive as a push notification, in-app alert, on-screen instructions, or email, and Tap on <strong>done</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1d8g30e/timeline_on_device_rolling_out">Timeline on device rolling out</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android">r/Android</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>According to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-timeline-location-data-on-device-migration/">email</a> sent to Android Police, users have until December 1, 2024, to be able to make the shift from the web version to the app. Otherwise, all the saved data will be lost. However, the company says that it will try moving up to 90 days of Timeline data to the "first-signed- in device" after the deadline. Any routes or visits made before that period will be auto-deleted.</p><p>Several users took to Reddit to express their dismay about this transition, while some felt that Google will now take the time to perfect the Timeline feature on the app. </p><p>One user stated that they use Google Timeline on the web daily and "this is very very bad news for me. They keep the option to upload to cloud, however that will be encrypted thus web viewing is gone. They don&apos;t care about current web users at all."</p><p>Another user feels that this would be a great move in terms of the overall experience using the Timeline feature on mobile,"it&apos;s not easy to navigate right now which is why I sometimes turn to the web, simple because it&apos;s faster and has more filtering options."</p><p>Transitioning from the Web to the App will give users autonomy over their personal data without the stress of having Google handle it. However, it could cause inconvenience to those who prefer using the web version to keep track of their whereabouts. The company says it is rolling this out gradually, and users will get a notification when an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1#:~:text=Timeline%20for%20Web%20Maps%20will%20be%20going%20away">update</a> is available for their account.</p>

Ahead of the launch, the first official marketing images appeared on the web, showcasing the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Z Flip 6.</p><p>The marketing image, looking like an advertisement for the upcoming Galaxy foldables was spotted by a Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-design-accidentally-leaked-samsung/">SamMobile</a>) on Samsung’s Kazakhstan website. According to the Reddit post, Samsung accidentally leaked the advertisement on the site before the launch.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1d8g5fp/galaxy_z_fold6_and_z_flip6_in_leaked_ad">Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 in leaked ad</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold">r/GalaxyFold</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The ad showcases the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a> alongside the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, which will likely debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable phones</a> next month. The shared image showcases the new design of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which will now have sharp edges and flat sides similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. </p><p>It will also have a triple camera system at the rear where all the cameras are stacked vertically in a single camera visor. The design looks similar to what we saw in the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-galaxy-z-fold-6-leak-reveals-the-foldable-from-the-front">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. </p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn’t see radical changes in terms of design when compared to the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The latter’s design was afresh, and it will likely continue this year, too, which is encouraging to see. It will have a more prominent cover display (folder-shaped) accompanied by dual primary cameras. </p>

<p>Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-likely-to-opt-for-wider-cover-screen">previous rumors</a>, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is expected to have a wider cover screen than the predecessor model and potentially feature wider overall dimensions when unfolded. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/forget-rumors-this-is-our-closest-look-at-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-in-real-world">leaked real-life image</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 dummy unit earlier this month also suggested the same.</p><p>The foldables launching next month will be powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and the foldable screens are rumored to have less crease than previous iterations. Ahead of the anticipated July 10 launch date, having an early glimpse of these foldables is an encouraging aspect to look forward to.</p>

<p>In a curious move, Google Messages is no longer displaying a user&apos;s draft in its main view.</p><p>The issue was reported in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1d81tf9/google_messages_is_no_longer_showing_previews_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Pixel subreddit</a> with users highlighting how Messages no longer display "Draft" in the conversation list (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/04/google-messages-drafts/">9to5Google</a>).

<p>If this <em>isn&apos;t </em>a bug, drafts disappearing from the main view wouldn&apos;t be too surprising as Google has removed other features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-auto-group-sms-texts-disappeared">like organization</a> for personal and business. The Messages app used to display chips for "All," "Personal," and "Business" texts but the choice to organize messages into those categories was removed.</p><p>The feature succeeded in helping users declutter their Messages app as they didn&apos;t have to see "Business" texts if they didn&apos;t want to. Last year, it was assumed that it was a bug (similar to today), but it quickly became a feature that was no more.</p><p>In other news, users are set to gain a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-cleaner-text-field-redesign">new, cleaner writing field</a> in Messages. The field will offer an emoji icon and a plus icon for adding images and other media instead of being filled with other Messages options.

<p>Google is quickly rushing out a patch for affected Android Auto devices that have encountered problems with its Maps beta.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-beta-crashing-android-auto/">Android Police</a> spotted the company rolling out a patch for the Maps beta marked as version <strong>11.132.01.01</strong> to Android Auto devices for the crashes. It might take a while before your device picks it up, so it could be best to avoid the Google Maps beta altogether.</p><p>For context, the company rolled out its latest Maps beta earlier this week, marked as version 11.132.0100. After installing, users quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/google_maps_beta_version_111320100_breaks_android/">took to Reddit</a> to report that the software broke their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> consoles. One user report highlighted that initiating Android Auto would crash Google Maps, leaving users in an endless cycle of crashing and returning to their app list.</p><p>Opening the app on an Android phone works fine, but throwing its contents over to your car is where things fall apart. Voice commands were also reportedly breaking the app and Android Auto&apos;s software.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l752i3l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user stated</a> they left the Maps beta and uninstalled all updates, reverting to the stable build, and still encountered problems. Hopefully, Google&apos;s latest attempt at a patch rectifies the problem.</p><p>There appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1d89bm0/comment/l75d66c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">an issue with charging</a>, as well, as one user reported that their phone is no longer charging when plugged into their console. Another user confirmed the problem, but it&apos;s unclear if this problem is related to the Maps beta issues.</p>

<p>As previously stated, Google has started rolling out a new patch today (June 6) to try and correct the Maps beta&apos;s effects on Android Auto.

Among the additions, drivers gained apps like Max, Peacock, and even Angry Birds. The update included the debut of Google Cast on the Android Automotive OS, which lets users throw content like videos from their phones to their vehicle&apos;s console.</p>
