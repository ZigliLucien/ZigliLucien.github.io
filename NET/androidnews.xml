                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I’ve been using an iPhone for over 12 years and recently switched to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. I finally feel like Google has figured it out, and here’s why I think switching to an Android device has never been so easy, seamless, and exciting.</p><p>Before diving into my experience and why I recently switched over, I want to remind you that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 Pro</a> isn&apos;t on sale for Prime Day at Amazon, plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more" target="_blank">Pixel devices are </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2024-dollar400-off-the-pixel-9-pixel-watch-discounts-and-more" target="_blank">on sale right now</a>. And if you don’t want the latest phone, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/unbelievable-the-google-pixel-8-pro-just-crashed-to-a-record-low-price-for-prime-big-deal-days" target="_blank">also opt for this Pixel 8 Pro Prime Day sale</a>, which I highly recommend.</p><p>Now, I know you’re going to try to chastise me and say, “How come the EIC of Android Central uses an iPhone as her primary device?” I’ve heard it all before, and if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/twitter-for-iphone-vs-twitter-for-android-stop-chastising-people-for-it-heres-why" target="_blank">want to read about my thoughts on that,</a> you can do so here.</p><p>As a journalist and the EIC of any tech publication, it’s essential to know about all phones. That means understanding both operating systems and what both sides of the argument have to offer.</p><p>Up until Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> of devices, I’ve always felt that Google lacked... <em>something</em>. It just never clicked for me. I felt like the phones weren’t ready for me to switch over to. Frankly, none of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android brands</a> have ever appealed to me to switch over permanently. I think it also was that perhaps Apple didn’t make it easy to switch over to.</p><p>This all changed when Google launched its new devices with a new processor, better cameras, and more seamless AI integration. It also helped that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everything-the-iphone-16-and-apple-watch-series-10-stole-from-android">iPhone 16</a> did not excite me when it was announced. That said, I have yet to test out my iPhone 16, so perhaps that opinion might change.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-really-care-about-blue-and-green-bubbles-2">Should you really care about blue and green bubbles?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the major considerations I had before switching was asking how much I really care about blue bubbles, and the answer to that is <em>not at all</em>. The only person I actually used iMessage with was my husband, and it would usually be to remind him to get something from the grocery store.</p><p>I typically use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">every other messaging platform</a> other than iMessage, so when thinking about this topic, it really wasn&apos;t a major issue.</p><p>That being said, you should think deeply about why it matters if you’re on iMessage or not. Is it an ego thing? Do you think you’ll be shunned and, in turn, have your pride hurt? For those of you who use iMessage, does it matter to you if someone else doesn’t? Because if that’s the case, I think it’s time to consider an alternative thought process.</p><p>All About Cookies, an informational website that provides tips, advice, and recommendations to help you with online privacy and digital security, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://allaboutcookies.org/apple-vs-android"><u>published a really interesting survey</u></a> of 1,000 people and their thoughts on blue vs. green bubbles.</p><p>Seventy-eight percent of iPhone users said they did not think less of people if they had a green bubble when they texted them. Furthermore, 42% of iPhone users rely on other third-party apps like WhatsApp. Not to mention, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">now that iPhones support RCS</a>, messaging with Android users has never been better.</p>
<h2 id="a-robust-smart-home-ecosystem-2">A robust smart home ecosystem</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WBMHNDUUBxEdn7HKN7iaS9" name="nest-wifi-pro-review-ducks-in-a-row.jpg" alt="Nest Wifi Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WBMHNDUUBxEdn7HKN7iaS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the blue bubble was something I thought about, one of the main considerations I had in switching over was Google’s robust smart home ecosystem.</p><p>My home currently has the Google Wifi AC1200 Mesh Wi-Fi System (which is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR">on sale for Prime Day</a>, as is the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCQSYPZB/">Nest Wifi Pro</a>). I also have the Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-review" target="_blank">Nest Doorbell</a> and the Nest Thermostat, and we have a bunch of Nest speakers around the house.</p><p>While my iPhone 15 did have easy access to Google Home, it just made sense for me to switch to a Pixel for that seamless connectivity.</p><p>I think Google got it right with its smart home products and newer phones, which is a pretty stark contrast to Apple’s pretty barebones selection of first-party smart home devices. Google’s products look like a cohesive collection of devices. You can have them all the same color or mix and match. But everything looks beautiful, and it was just exciting to have everything be Google in my home.</p><p>I was basically halfway there, and my smart home setup pushed me to fill the gap by switching over.</p>
<h2 id="the-iphone-15-is-a-gateway-phone-2">The iPhone 15 is a gateway phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR" name="iphone-15-pro-max-usb-c.jpg" alt="A USB-C cable and an iPhone 15 Pro Max on a wooden table, showcasing the iPhone's USB Type-C port." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the iPhone is a completely different phone from the Pixel. However, I noticed that I did not struggle as much with switching to an Android device for several reasons.</p><p>I think the first main thing I will note is that, to me, Google’s Pixel is the iPhone of the Android ecosystem. It’s the phone that has the least amount of bloatware, comes with the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> suite (which I already used), and is simple to use. </p><p>More importantly, because the iPhone now has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">USB-C</a>, it was way easier not to worry about buying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">new cables</a>; everything in my home was already USB-C. Android Central&apos;s managing editor Derrek Lee pointed this out when the iPhone 15 first launched, noting how it was a smart move that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/usb-c-iphone-15-could-tempt-android-users">could make it easier to get Android users to switch</a>. I just took that and went in the opposite direction.</p><p>While some people might complain that MagSafe isn’t on a Pixel, I never used it on my iPhone and never found it that exciting, so, like iMessage, it’s just another thing I won’t miss.</p>
<h2 id="google-sets-the-standard-for-phones-with-ai-2">Google sets the standard for phones with AI</h2>
<p>Google got it right with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features on the Pixel 9 series, many of which are already available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>. Google has had two years to enhance Gemini, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-you-probably-should-not-mind-iphone-16-complaints">Apple is still developing Apple AI</a>. In fact, the iPhone 16 didn’t even come with any of the announced Apple Intelligence features at launch.</p><p>I’m not going to sit here and rag on Apple because I will always be a big Apple fan. I still use a MacBook, and I plan on using an iPhone 16, especially to test out its AI features.</p><p>I also plan to go a little bit more indepth with some of the app features I have enjoyed and camera features on the Pixel later on. But I have to say, using my Pixel has been one of the best experiences I have had and I have truly been enjoying it.</p><p>And if you&apos;re considering doing the same, you should definitely try it out. </p>

<p>It&apos;s not just the design either; the OnePlus 12 has one of the best 120Hz AMOLED panels of any device today, and you get good PWM dimming — it&apos;s easy on the eyes. It also has the best camera package of any OnePlus phone, and it does a better job than the Galaxy S24 in this regard. And right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL/">you can get the OnePlus 12 for $599</a> — a $200 discount.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 12 has one of the best hardware packages of any phone today, and the design is evocative. You get outstanding cameras, ultra-fast charging, and a fluid interface. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3b4e6038-9bd0-42b3-80a2-c38d7c799676" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12 (12GB/256GB): $799" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12 (12GB/256GB): $799">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a good-looking phone with terrific hardware, ultra-fast charging, and great battery life. The cameras are finally on the same level as other flagships, and it outshines the Galaxy S24.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need seven years of updates, and IP68 water resistance.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with OnePlus in the past was that its cameras weren&apos;t quite up to scratch, and that&apos;s thankfully changed this year. The OnePlus 12 is able to hold its own against the Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 Pro, and if anything, I prefer the device to Samsung. The Hasselblad tuning is skewed towards natural colors, you get a lot of cool filters and effects, and the auxiliary cameras are quite good.</p><p>OxygenOS is also much better than the last two years, and while you don&apos;t get a clean UI any longer, it is stable, and has much better fluidity than One UI 6 on the Galaxy S24. The only issue is that the phone will get fewer software updates than the S24; OnePlus is guaranteeing four OS updates, and while that is decent enough, it isn&apos;t on par with what Samsung and Google provide.</p><p>The rest of the hardware is pretty good too; the battery lasts a day and a half between charges, and you get 100W charging tech — which makes 25W on the S24 look archaic. So if you&apos;re looking to buy a phone and want something with power to spare, the OnePlus 12 is a good choice — particularly now that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL/">available for just $599</a>.</p>

I liked the inherent scalability and the range of products available, and the brand does a great job in this area. However, I needed Google Home integration, and that&apos;s not something Ubiquiti provides — you need to use its own UniFi Protect service.</p><p>So I started looking at other security cameras last year, and grudgingly, I settled on Google&apos;s Nest Cam. The camera isn&apos;t that great; the battery is pathetic, the footage isn&apos;t clean, and you can&apos;t use the camera without an $80 Nest Aware plan. The only reason I started using it is the convenience and security.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there&apos;s now an alternative. Reolink swiftly rose up the ranks in recent years, and its cameras have local storage, plenty of great features, high-resolution sensors, and best of all, Google Home integration. </p><p>I used the Argus 4 Pro for just over four months now, and it has proven to be a reliable alternative to the Nest camera — one that works locally. The camera is designed for outdoor use, and it comes with a solar charging panel. The kit costs $219, but it&apos;s now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Argus-Pro-Blindspot-Free-Compatible/dp/B0D17NG155">down to just $139</a>, making it a great value.</p>

<p>Reolink has proven security protocols, and the use of dual lenses in this camera means you get 180-degree coverage. It has motion detection, Google Home integration, and saves data locally — no need to use a cloud license to access your footage.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Argus-Pro-Blindspot-Free-Compatible/dp/B0D17NG155" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0e6383b5-11ff-44b2-81f6-1aab3be350f6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Reolink Argus 4 Pro Solar Camera: $219" data-dimension48="Reolink Argus 4 Pro Solar Camera: $219">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a reliable security camera that stores footage locally, and doesn&apos;t need a monthly fee. You can slot in a MicroSD card into the camera, image resolution is terrific, and the battery life has been great — you don&apos;t have to worry about it at all if you use the 6W solar charging panel.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need continuous recording.</p>
<p>Reolink didn&apos;t leave anything out with this camera; it uses dual lenses to deliver 180-degree coverage, and the footage is much better than what I got out of the Nest Cam. The 6W solar panel does a great job delivering continual charge, and you don&apos;t have to think about manually charging up the camera if you go this route.</p><p>You can record footage to a MicroSD card; I slotted in a 128GB card, and it should be good enough to hold a year&apos;s worth of footage. I didn&apos;t see any issues with connectivity either, and overall, the camera has been reliable.</p><p>The camera records up to 4K, has motion detection, and there&apos;s two-way audio. What I like the most is the Google Home integration; it was easy to add the camera to my device list in the platform, and I was able to view footage and access alerts via Home. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Argus-Pro-Blindspot-Free-Compatible/dp/B0D17NG155">deal price of $139</a> is costlier than what that of the Nest Cam, this is a significantly better product, and you don&apos;t have to shell out a fee to use the camera at all.</p>

<ul><li>Files by Google app has a new button right alongside the previous "Scan" button.</li><li>It is dubbed "Receive," which, when clicked, opens up Google's Quick Share functionality.</li><li>The latest addition is seen in the Files by Google app bearing the 1.4955.677425801.0 version.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Files by Google app will soon have a new floating action button (FAB) to complement the existing Quick Share functionality. It is dubbed "Receive" and is spotted in the latest stable version of the app.</p><p>The new functionality spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/07/files-by-google-receive-fab/">9to5Google</a> will be at the bottom right of your screen, where the "Scan" button currently resides on the Files by Google app. However, The Scan button has been moved up a little and is also a bit shrunk, with the new "Receive" FAB residing right below it. It is accompanied by the Quick Share icon as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8Sk3xpvRGEvW8fX5iqi8pm" name="Files-by-Google-receive-button-new.jpg" alt="New Receive FAB on Files by Google app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Sk3xpvRGEvW8fX5iqi8pm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, tapping the new FAB button will give you a nifty prompt dubbed "Receive from others nearby," indicating that you will make your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android device</a> available to everyone to receive a file with Quick Share. Clicking it further will open up the Quick Share sheet, but in the Files by Google app.</p><p>9to5 also points out that the latest FAB rollout has been seen on the latest version of the Files by Google app bearing <strong>1.4955.677425801.0</strong> and on the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. If you own a Pixel device, you should start seeing the rollout soon. Even if you are on the aforementioned version of the app and have not seen it already, you might probably see it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the new Receive FAB will make receiving files easier than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Quick Share</a>, as enabling it requires a multi-step process, which is not the case with the new button on the Files by Google app.</p><p>The latest addition to the Files by Google app comes after a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-app-gets-carousel-view-for-recent-files">recent redesign</a> of the file management app. Early last month, the redesign included the ability to view recent files in the form of a carousel similar to what we have seen in the Memories section in the Google Photos app. The change was seen in the latest beta next to some official versions of the Files by Google app.</p>

<p>That&apos;s why Baseus&apos;s retractable cable is so good; it has a minimalist design, and the compact size makes it the ideal choice on the go — particularly if you need to use a cable in your car. The cable has four length presets, weighs just 50g, and the best part is that it charges at up to 100W over the USB PD protocol. I used this cable for a year now, and it&apos;s so good I ended up getting four. Thanks to Prime Day, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0C858GPF9/">buy it for just $11</a>.</p>

<p>This retractable cable has everything you need in a USB-C to USB-C cable. It charges at up to 100W and uses the PD protocol, it's lightweight enough to use anywhere, and it's durable — I used it for a year now, and haven't run into any issues.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0C858GPF9/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b2e18f8a-e3c4-429f-b9ef-8fb4c1f667a5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Baseus 100W Retractable USB-C to USB-C Cable: $19" data-dimension48="Baseus 100W Retractable USB-C to USB-C Cable: $19">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You want a reliable USB-C to USB-C cable with a retractable design. Baseus sells this cable in four color options (I have the blue one, and it&apos;s great).</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a cable with an E-Marker chip.</p>
<p>Baseus did all the right things with this cable; it has a flat design, each preset is of a good length — 1.1ft, 1.9ft, 2.7ft, and 3.3ft — and the cable is built to last. I used it hundreds of times over the last year to charge phones and tablets, and it doesn&apos;t have any obvious signs of wear.</p><p>Oh, and Baseus sells these cables in four color options. The only issue with the cable is that you don&apos;t get an E-Marker chip, but I use a power meter on my desk charging station, and it delivered a consistent charge in line with the USB PD 3.0 protocol, going up to 100W. Honestly, if you need a retractable cable with a reliable build quality and 100W charging, there really isn&apos;t anything better, and the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0C858GPF9/">you can buy it at just $11</a> is a steal.</p>

Both the original model and its successor were massive hits and with good reason. With the recent discounts that we have been seeing regularly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/my-favorite-marshall-prime-day-deal-is-back-and-its-cheaper-than-ever-before">Emberton II can be bought for $100 during sales like Prime Day</a>, which is unbeatable for that sound quality.</p><p>Marshall refreshed its Emberton and Willen lineup in August 2024. The Marshall Emberton III is fresh out of the oven but it looks nearly identical to the last generation at first glance. There are subtle differences, but the real question is whether it&apos;s worth the buy now that the Emberton II is consistently so darn cheap.</p>

<p>You can purchase the Marshall Emberton III for $170 from Amazon and most other retailers. The Emberton III is available in one of two of Marshall&apos;s signature shades, Black & Brass and Cream.</p>

<p>Now I&apos;m not going to lie to you, besides being slightly louder, having an even longer uptime, and a few small changes, the Emberton III isn&apos;t radically different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-ii-review">Emberton II</a>. But I think that&apos;s perfectly alright because it continues to serve consistently well and can easily fill any large room with amazing sound. Any time I use the speaker at parties or while hanging out with friends, I always get asked, "Hey, what speaker is that?". Coming from friends who are JBL loyalists, that&apos;s no small feat.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> is noticeably louder than its last-gen counterpart. Marshall maintains its excellent tuning, so the Emberton III produces lovely notes that are alterable via the EQ presets in the Marshall app. Unfortunately, we still don&apos;t have customizable EQ options, but the presets are so good it can be forgiven this time. The signature Marshall sound is fun and extremely well-balanced, with the highs and the lows sounding just right. It has that oomph, that lively, high-quality feel to it.</p><p>The sound is not particularly bass-heavy, but it is rich and lively. You can alter it to your liking through the app if it&apos;s not booming enough for you. I found the high notes to be particularly crisp with excellent clarity levels. The speaker fires sound from the front and back grills, producing 360-degree multi-directional audio. Marshall uses its proprietary True Stereophonic tech to deliver spatial and binaural sound.</p>

<p>Physically speaking, there&apos;s now a dedicated power button and a new bracket so you can attach hooks or carabiners to it. The speaker continues to have a robust IP67 water and dust-proof rating and a classy leather-and-metal design. You can submerge the speaker in water as deep as 1m or 3ft for up to 30 minutes without sustaining damage. Also, it can pair with multiple other Emberton III speakers thanks to the Stack Mode.</p><p>Marshall bumped the 30-hour battery life to an even more impressive 32-hour battery life. The charge time is also improved thanks to fast charging tech that tops up the speaker from zero to a hundred percent in two hours.</p><p>Setting up the speaker is super easy thanks to Google Fast Pair. As long as the speaker is on and around Android phones or devices, you get an immediate prompt to connect to the Emberton III. I even connected the speaker to my smart TV in a matter of seconds thanks to Google Fast Pair.</p>

<p>A great new feature included in the Marshall Emberton III speaker is Bluetooth Auracast. My colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Derrek Lee spoke about the benefits of Auracast</a> at length in his editorial, so I won&apos;t do a deep dive here. You should really read his article to truly understand the power of Auracast. It is the future of Bluetooth and the best evolution of Bluetooth to come. Basically, it enables public and private broadcasts via Bluetooth LE.</p><p>Although Auracast is not properly available on phones and devices just yet, it&apos;s very comforting to know that the Emberton III is already compatible with it. You won&apos;t need to upgrade this speaker once Auracast is everywhere. This makes it a secure buy, giving you the assurance that it&apos;s a future-proof Bluetooth speaker.</p><p>After using the Marshall Emberton III speaker for two months, I have become quite fond of it. I rely on the speaker and end up taking it with me on road trips or group hangouts. It costs less than $200, which is a fabulous price point in my opinion. This one was a major hit for me and I can&apos;t recommend it enough.</p><p>Sure, the $100 Emberton II is an unmissable deal, but if you want something that&apos;s ready for the future, spend that extra $70 and get the latest Marshall Emberton III. Trust me, it&apos;s worth it.</p>

<p>Marshall has launched the Emberton III and it is just as good as I had hoped for. This speaker gets a glowing review from me and I can't recommend it enough. Everything from the sound quality to the connectivity is top-notch. This is the best Bluetooth speaker under $200.</p></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;m obsessed with multi-room audio; I have a lot of speakers in the house, and instead of buying Bluetooth-enabled products, I decided to add streaming dongles instead. I used Chromecast Audio in the past, but they haven&apos;t been available for a while now, and these days, I use WiiM&apos;s solutions.</p>
<p>Basically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/wiim-amp-review">WiiM Amp</a> is a network streamer that unlocks a suite of use cases. It has a built-in amplifier, making it a decent choice to connect to passive speakers — up to 60W each channel — and you have subwoofer out. With HDMI ARC, USB, optical, and Ethernet, you get everything you need to hook up your audio gear and connect it to your TV.</p><p>The best part is that it integrates with Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, DLNA, Chromecast, AirPlay 2, and Alexa Cast, so regardless of what streaming platform you use, you can easily connect to the device. Honestly, the Amp is one of those products that just works, and it is the bedrock of my home entertainment system. It usually costs $299, but for Prime Day, WiiM is slashing the price by 20%, so you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H/">pick it up for just $239</a>. That is an unbelievable value when you consider what the Amp can do.</p>

<p>The WiiM Amp has all the features you'd ever need in a network amp, and it combines standout audio with an elegant design. If you need an easy way to connect speakers to turntables and your TV, this is the way to go.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f5ffc740-0e09-41bf-a678-bca9974dd034" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="WiiM Amp Streaming Amplifier: $299" data-dimension48="WiiM Amp Streaming Amplifier: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a network streaming amp with incredible sound and plenty of connectivity. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need headphone out. </p>
<p>Setting up the Amp is about as easy as it gets, and the mobile interface has a polished design. The design of the Amp itself is great, and it looks minimalist. The built-in ESS Sabre DAC is one of the best in this category, and while the connectivity is decent in its own right, you&apos;re buying this device for the sound — it does a magnificent job in this regard.</p><p>The tight integration with all streaming protocols also gives the Amp a distinct edge. You get Alexa and Google Assistant control as well, and there&apos;s a remote that you can use to control the device. If you don&apos;t need all the features and want a puck-sized device, the WiiM Mini is a better option, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Mini-Multiroom-Preamplifier-Assistants/dp/B09HC5GRKY">that is down to $75 right now</a>.

<p>When my town was hit by Hurricane Helene nearly two weeks ago, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> was the only one with a strong enough signal to get messages out to let loved ones know we were OK before all cell networks went down on Friday, September 28. Even when networks were slowly coming back online two days later, the Razr was consistently able to get messages in and out while other phones kept trying and failing, and it made it one of the most useful gadgets to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/these-gadgets-got-me-through-the-worst-hurricane-of-my-life">during the hurricane</a>.</p><p>Motorola phones have long had the best signal strength of any brand, but it wasn&apos;t until this frightening time that I truly appreciated the strengths of this incredible phone.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> You&apos;re looking for a phone that folds in half and fits perfectly in any pocket or bag, has all day battery life, and features flicker-free OLED displays that won&apos;t hurt your eyes even in dim light.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a phone with an ultra wide-angle camera or a telephoto camera that zooms well beyond 4x.</p>
<p>Aside from great signal strength, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is an amazing phone that folds in half and fits perfectly into any pocket, bag, or purse. The Razr was the first flip-style folding phone with a large outer display and it&apos;s truly a sight to behold when folded closed. It takes up the entirety of the outside half of the phone, with just the two camera modules in the bottom right corner, and it comes in handy in more ways than one.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s excellent software experience lets you use any app on the cover screen while other companies like Samsung restrict cover screen apps to a select few. There are ways to get all apps on the cover screen of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 but they&apos;re pretty clunky and don&apos;t work like they do on the Razr.</p><p>My wife often messages people from the cover screen without ever opening the big display. I&apos;ve seen Android Central&apos;s Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, do this on many occasions, as well, and it proves the point that the cover display is more than capable; it&apos;s often the best and most convenient way to use the phone. I can also recall countless times when I&apos;ve seen friends and other tech journalists playing one of the many cover screen games that ship with the phone to pass the time, posting high scores online and challenging others to beat them.</p><p>But why would you want to use a screen that&apos;s half the size of the main display? Better battery life. In fact, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024&apos;s battery life is nothing short of fantastic and is easily the second biggest quality of life upgrade if you&apos;re coming from other flip phones. Historically, flip phones like the Galaxy Z Flip series haven&apos;t had the best battery life in the world, and while more recent entries like the Z Flip 5 and Z Flip 6 address this, those phones still don&apos;t get battery life as the Razr Plus 2024 does.</p><p>Motorola also uses OLED displays that are much friendlier on the eyes than the Samsung Z Flip series, sporting options to reduce flicker and block blue light. This has been particularly important for me as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> person as it doesn&apos;t give me a headache to look at the phone for any length of time.</p><p>If I had to chose one flip-style foldable phone to buy this year, there&apos;s no doubt in my mind that it would be the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, especially with this great Amazon Big Deals Day sale.</p>
