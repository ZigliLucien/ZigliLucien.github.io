                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For Prime Day&apos;s first day, Google dropped $250 off the Pixel 8 Pro, making it a great deal that you could feel good about. But the second half of Prime Day is seeing an even <em>steeper</em> discount, slashing <strong>$300 off</strong> Google&apos;s best Pixel phone and dropping it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CGT9MH6F"><strong>historic low price of $699</strong></a>.</p><p>That&apos;s the best deal we&apos;ve ever seen on an unlocked Pixel 8 Pro and it&apos;s just in time because Prime Day ends at the close of business <strong>today</strong>. Right now, Amazon has the Bay Blue and Obsidian Black colorways of the Google Pixel 8 Pro at this historically low price, while the cream variant is still at the previously low price of $749. Definitely grab this one before it&apos;s gone!</p>

<p>Getting a brand new flip phone for less than the price of a regular slab phone is hard to believe, but it's totally real on Prime Day. Amazon has knocked <strong>$420 off</strong> the regular price of the Z Flip 5 just for today, meaning now is the best time to experience Samsung's best flip features without paying the extra high price of the Z Flip 6.</p>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You value a smartphone&apos;s camera above all else. Google Pixel phones do a lot well and are granted seven years of software updates from Google, but the camera shines through the competition no matter the year. If you&apos;re a parent or just have lots of pets you love taking pictures of, the Pixel 8 Pro is going to make you <em>very</em> happy.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You don&apos;t mind paying a bit more money for the upcoming Pixel 9 series. We expect Google to announce it just next month but it&apos;s guaranteed to be hundreds more than this deal. Still, don&apos;t be surprised when you see the Pixel 9 to appear soon.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8 Pro is the best phone Google has ever made, bar none. I called it "King of the Androids" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">in my review last November</a> because of the huge paradigm shift Google delivered with its new AI features. Tons of phones have many similar features these days but it was Google who started the trend and still does it best.</p><p>In fact, features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> simply can&apos;t be found on any other phone series on the market, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-video-boost-pixel-8-pro">Video Boost</a> remains one of the best Pixel 8 Pro-exclusive features for enhancing any video taken with the phone.</p><p>As I said previously, the Pixel 8 Pro is a master of taking photos of your pets or kids, as Google&apos;s built-in AI smarts can understand what&apos;s happening in the scene and adjust parameters to capture the best photo. This means that the phone takes dozens of photos every second and analyzes them to find the best one, often taking bits and pieces of each photo to create the ideal image.</p><p>Maybe even cooler is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a> feature which lets you choose the "best face" from anyone in a photo when you take several photos in a row. That&apos;s great for group shots where everyone might not be looking at the camera at the same time.</p><p>Of course, you probably know by now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a> is right around the corner, hence the steep discount for last year&apos;s model. While we don&apos;t expect a revelatory release this year, Google looks to be changing up the style of the Pixel in a pretty monumental way. Newer doesn&apos;t always mean better — and it&apos;s probably going to cost you a lot more money — but it could be worth waiting for if you have to have the latest and greatest.</p>

With this limited-time discount, you can get the 64GB configuration for 39% off or spend a little more to snag the larger 128GB storage version for 43% off without the annoyance of lock screen advertising. I recommend the 128GB version as you save more and just get better value for your money.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is what happens when Amazon stops worrying about being cost-effective and starts focusing on making a great Android tablet. I'd argue that the effort was quite successful, as the Fire Max 11 boasts a capable octa-core processor, vibrant 11-inch display, and up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a 43% discount, it's also an absolute steal right now. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor-lockscreen/dp/B0B2SFTGQ6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="76283f16-20cf-4680-9bc0-cd07181448ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$279.99" data-dimension48="$279.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazon-prime-day-2024-faq"><span>Amazon Prime Day 2024 FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-does-prime-day-end-2">When does Prime Day end?</h2>
<p>Prime Day lasts two days and this year ends on July 17th, 2024. While some deals may continue through the week, some of the best deals have a time limit and <em>will </em>end on the 17th. Prime Day started on July 16th. <br>
<br>
So make sure you are grabbing those deals when you have the chance!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-prime-day-2024-xa0-2">What is Prime Day 2024? </h2>
<p>Prime Day is Amazon&apos;s biggest sale of the year, offering Prime members some of the most epic discounts this side of Black Friday. It started back in 2015 and runs for 48 hours each summer (usually in July). In addition to regular discounts, Prime Day is chock full of flash deals, invite-only opportunities, and much more. </p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-to-have-amazon-prime-to-get-prime-day-deals-2">Do you have to have Amazon Prime to get Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>Pretty much. Prime Day was specifically designed to benefit Prime members, so the vast majority of deals on the site will only be available to those who sign up for the subscription service.</p><p>If you aren&apos;t a Prime member yet and you aren&apos;t interested in paying the $14.99 monthly fee, it&apos;s worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon offers a 30-day free trial</strong></a> that you can cancel at any time. In other words, you could sign up on July 1st, enjoy all of the money-saving benefits of Prime Day 2024, and cancel your account before the month ends. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-best-prime-day-deals-2">How do I find the best Prime Day deals?</h2>
<p>In addition to simply monitoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">Amazon&apos;s deal home page</a>, Prime members can also stay on top of the best Prime Day deals by signing up for the Prime Insider newsletter and creating alert notifications on their favorite product categories. </p><p>I also recommend using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">Camelcamelcamel.com</a> for price tracking and, of course, watching this guide (and Android Central in general) for up-to-date deal coverage and shopping advice.</p>
<h2 id="is-prime-day-only-at-amazon-2">Is Prime Day only at Amazon?</h2>
<p>Prime Day is technically exclusive to Amazon shoppers, but you&apos;ll likely find that all of the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors — including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target — will be launching sales of their own around the same time. Just like past years, we&apos;ll be covering all of the best rival sales that are relevant to Android users, so check back later for news.</p>

I prefer open-ear wireless earbuds that let me naturally tune into my surroundings, so I always catch any cars, bikes, or other dangers that might normally sneak up on me. That&apos;s why my go-to earbuds became the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">Shokz OpenFit</a>, which are currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-OpenFit-Headphones-Microphone-Compatible/dp/B0BYSQDWRT"><strong>$124 (31% off) on Amazon</strong></a> for Prime Day 2024.</p><p>When it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a>, most athletes prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/shokz-openrun-pro-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro</a>, which have the exact same price and discount for Prime Day: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BVXT8TJ"><strong>$124 ($55 off)</strong></a>. My preference, the OpenFit, is more of a bridge to people used to "traditional" earbud sound. Instead of sending audio through the bones in your ear, the OpenFit drape over your ears to play audio from above. They&apos;re secure and comfortable, surprisingly rich, and water-resistant enough to deal with rain and sweat.</p>

<p>Shokz OpenFit last 7 hours with another 21 hours in the charging case, getting enough juice for a run in just a few minutes. It arguably has better audio quality than you normally get from bone conduction headphones, while retaining the same perk: a safer setup for keeping your spatial awareness and letting your ear canals rest.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You dislike bone conduction earbuds or the artificial quality of transparency mode, but still need workout earbuds that leave you capable of hearing your surroundings. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You&apos;d rather prioritize the best possible audio quality, or if you need ANC outside of workouts.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried running with different in-ear earbuds over the years. Aside from being prone to falling out mid-run, they signal to people that I&apos;m not paying attention to my surroundings, which has gotten me looks during races where they recommend no one wear earbuds. Open-ear earbuds are considered the exception, because it shows I&apos;m being considerate and will notice if someone says "on your left!"</p><p>Since I reviewed the Shokz OpenFit last year, I haven&apos;t switched to any other earbuds, except for a short-lived test of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/earbud-heart-rate-accuracy-test">earbuds with heart rate tracking</a> that only made me miss my usual earbuds. Unless something better comes along, I probably won&apos;t switch!</p><p>Your alternative open-ear, bone-conduction option that&apos;s a bit cheaper is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/anker-soundcore-aerofit-review">Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro</a>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Headphones-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant/dp/B0CCRSQG8K"><strong>$99 (41% off) for Prime Day</strong></a>. They have slightly better IP water resistance and last an impressive 14 hours per charge, double the OpenFit&apos;s battery. Our reviewer was impressed with the audio quality but found them a bit too big in terms of comfort. Since I haven&apos;t tried them myself, I can only pass on his recommendation!</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is generally considered one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-overall">best Android smartwatches</a> out there, and at 42% off at Amazon for Prime Day, this capable device is definitely worth your consideration. This deal is for the Bespoke Edition of the watch with a special 44mm Graphite band. It also features Bluetooth, health, fitness, and sleeping trackers, and a large, bright display that's easy on the eyes.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7PYYS1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cd9dee09-e939-49dd-b211-b7e898af94c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$379.99" data-dimension48="$379.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you don&apos;t mind going with a previous-generation smartwatch for the sake of a great deal; you want something with a satisfying capacitive bezel; you need health features such as personalized HR zones and passive AFib detection.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want something super lightweight; you need the industry&apos;s best battery life in a smartwatch.</p><p>Samsung launched its next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-and-watch-7-ultra-are-missing-a-killer-feature">Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra</a> last week, but most casual smartwatch users will be content with the performance of prior generations. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Bespoke Edition 44mm, in particular, is a solid pick at any price point, let alone at this one. </p><p>On the downside, some of the GPS tracking and health sensors can be a little inaccurate, mainly including the BIA readings—though it hasn&apos;t been FDA approved to reliably test blood pressure anyway. It also isn&apos;t the most lightweight smartwatch available, and the Watch 6 battery life stagnated compared to previous generations.</p><p>Otherwise, the Watch 6 features a beautiful display, Bluetooth, and a fun-to-use capacitive bezel, along with super-fast charging and decent battery life. And if that isn&apos;t enough, maybe $160 off will be.</p>

<p>With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC and 8GB of RAM, the OnePlus Nord N30 5G is capable enough of handling everyday usage tasks without any issues. It comes with a triple-lens rear camera setup and runs Android 13 (with OxygenOS 13.2) out of the box. You get multi-band 5G support, stereo speakers, and even a 3.5mm audio port. The smartphone sports a 5,000mAh battery that can be juiced up in little to no time with the bundled 50W ultra-fast charger.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C22BRGLG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2a40ce31-6424-46fb-8007-70e3602bcd50" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want an affordable smartphone with practical features like a microSD expansion slot, a 3.5mm audio port, and ultra-fast charging.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of games on your smartphone, and value things like camera quality and decent software support.</p><p>Whenever we talk about OnePlus, the term &apos;flagship killer&apos; often comes to mind. That&apos;s all well and good, but the brand&apos;s line-up includes a wide range of smartphones (among other products) catering to all price segments. One of them is the OnePlus Nord N30 5G, which still remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300" target="_blank">best Android phones under $300</a> available in the market, despite being a year old at this point.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord N30 5G comes with a 6.72-inch IPS LCD screen having a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset with 8GB of RAM, which Android Central&apos;s Nicholas Sutrich found to be decent enough for handling everyday tasks in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review" target="_blank">his review</a>, although the gaming performance was a bit underwhelming. The smartphone features 128GB of internal storage, and there&apos;s a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android" target="_blank">microSD</a> expansion slot as well.</p><p>When it comes to connectivity and I/O, the OnePlus Nord N30 5G doesn&apos;t disappoint. As the name suggests, you get solid multi-band 5G support for all major carriers. The smartphone also includes stereo speakers, NFC, and a 3.5mm audio port. Backing up the whole package is a 5,000mAh battery that can be juiced up in little to no time, all thanks to ultra-fast 50W charging support.</p><p>The OnePlus Nord N30 5G has a few shortcomings as well. It runs Android 13 (with OxygenOS 13.2 overlaid on top) out of the box and will just get one OS update. Also, only the main sensor of its triple-lens primary camera setup is usable. However, for a smartphone that offers so much value, these issues don&apos;t really matter.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is wrapping up an experiment it started a few months ago where you are able to add your own unique notes to search results.</p><p>The annotation feature acted like a simple crowdsourced knowledge base on top of search results. It allowed users to add extra information to specific webpages. These added insights, called "Notes," were visible to other searchers, helping them find better information.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-notes">Started with a limited group of users last November</a>, the feature didn&apos;t seem to gain enough popularity for a wider release. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/16/google-search-notes-ending/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this experimental feature will be discontinued in late July.</p><p>Google reiterates that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-opens-access-to-search-labs">Search Labs is a space for bold experiments</a> with the search experience and admits that not all these trials will lead to a broader rollout, as per the report.</p><p>"We’re excited to continue testing new ways to connect people to authentic, relatable voices and look forward to bringing some of our learnings from Notes into future product experiences," a Google representative told 9to5.</p><p>In its statement, Google recognized users&apos; interest in sharing knowledge with each other based on their own research. The Notes experiment was a trial to support this on the Search platform.</p><p>Google Search Labs operates as a testing ground for various experiments. New features are regularly introduced, while some are eventually phased out. So, ending Notes is just part of Google&apos;s ongoing process of trying out and refining ideas.</p><p>Or ditching them altogether.</p><p>If you&apos;re curious about the Notes experiment, there&apos;s still a chance to check it out. The feature will be available until the end of July. You can access it through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search" target="_blank">Search Labs portal</a>.</p><p>If you were part of the experiment, you can view and download your notes until the end of the month. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://takeout.google.com/?pli=1" target="_blank">Google Takeout</a> will let you download your contributions until the end of August.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I get a ridiculous number of phones, and it has been busier than usual in 2024. I crossed the 50-phone mark by the end of June, but you&apos;re not here to know about that — you want recommendations on which phone to buy, and I&apos;m here to deliver it.</p><p>I tend to suggest Pixels, and while the Pixel 8a is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-8a-Unlocked-Advanced/dp/B0CYQ916ZY">good deal at $449</a>, I&apos;m more interested in another device that incidentally costs the same right now: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>. OnePlus did all the right things in 2024, and the 12R takes the best features of the stellar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> but is much more accessible, just like what the Pixel 8a does with the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro.</p><p>The OnePlus 12R debuted at $499, and the 16GB/256GB version I&apos;m highlighting here usually costs $599. But right now, you can get that model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B0CQ9SZJN6/">for just $449 on Amazon</a>, and that is the single best phone deal around if you need a new mid-range phone.</p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fbd81dc6-40a1-4ce6-8435-2f3721416741" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B0CQ9SZJN6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="HPkFrvgpDwnU4aVmhtmoxC" name="oneplus-12r-blue-400-500.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPkFrvgpDwnU4aVmhtmoxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B0CQ9SZJN6/" data-dimension112="fbd81dc6-40a1-4ce6-8435-2f3721416741" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599"><del><strong>$599</strong></del><strong> $449 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>The OnePlus 12R has a vibrant AMOLED screen, powerful hardware that handles demanding games, and a great 50MP camera at the back. In my use, I easily got a day and a half between charges even with heavy use, and the phone takes just 30 minutes to charge thanks to 100W charging.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B0CQ9SZJN6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fbd81dc6-40a1-4ce6-8435-2f3721416741" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R (16GB/256GB): $599">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a powerful phone that looks good and takes fabulous photos and videos. The OnePlus 12R also has the best battery life in this segment, and with 100W charging as standard, you won&apos;t ever have to leave it plugged in overnight.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want clean software or a great auxiliary sensor. While the main 50MP camera on the 12R is fantastic, the wide-angle lens is strictly average.</p>
<p>The regular OnePlus 12 is also on sale at the moment, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Smartphone-Processor-Hasselblad/dp/B0CQ5MYYZL/">buy it for $599</a>. While that is enticing, you&apos;re not necessarily getting a whole lot more; the OnePlus 12 has wireless charging, better auxiliary cameras, and will get an additional software update. If you think that&apos;s worth an extra $150, then yes, you should get the OnePlus 12.</p><p>Having used both extensively, I think the OnePlus 12R is the better value of the two devices; it looks and feels the same, you get the same great AMOLED panel and main camera, and the exact same software. The phone isn&apos;t without faults; the wide-angle camera isn&apos;t as good as the Pixel 8a, and it won&apos;t get as many updates. But if you want a powerful phone that will last several years, the OnePlus 12R is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B0CQ9SZJN6/">terrific deal at $449</a>.</p>

Small, portable projectors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a> are perfect for such settings. Most people don&apos;t usually get XGIMI or other branded projectors because they cost a pretty penny, but today isn&apos;t any ordinary day. The XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro is selling for the lowest price we have ever seen thanks to this Prime Day 2024 deal, bringing down its price from $499.99 to a mere <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWQB77LX"><strong>$369.00 at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><p>If you&apos;ve searched for portable projectors, you would have come across XGIMI. The Chinese manufacturer gained a lot of momentum over the last few years on the back of its portable projectors, selling over four million units globally. The affordable MoGo 2 Pro has all the features you need: dual 8W drivers, bright projection that goes up to 400 lumens, autofocus and auto keystone correction, and Android TV 11.0 out of the box.</p>

<p>The XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro is the best portable projector around, and it delivers terrific image quality, great onboard sound, and Android TV 11.0. This is the cheapest price we have ever seen for the smart projector, so you can't miss this Prime Day deal. There's only one more day until the offer expires, so if you want one, you must act now!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BWQB77LX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8f69170d-376a-433f-b01d-06f4562e48b4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro: $499.99" data-dimension48="XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro: $499.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a budget, portable speaker with Android TV that&apos;s priced under $400.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a projector with a built-in battery.</p><p>The best part of the MoGo 2 Pro is the image quality; while 400 lumens may not seem like a lot, it is more than adequate for use at night, and even in situations where there&apos;s ambient light, you get a viewable image. The picture quality is outstanding for a portable projector, and you get a lot of customizability in this area.</p><p>And with Android TV 11.0 under the hood, you have full access to the Play Store and can install your favorite streaming services — barring Netflix. There&apos;s still no Netflix on XGIMI devices, and while there&apos;s now a workaround that does a decent enough job, it isn&apos;t as straightforward as installing the service from the Play Store.</p><p>The onboard sound is also astonishingly good, and it is sufficient if you&apos;re just looking to stream a movie in the backyard. The portability is another area where the MoGo 2 Pro scores highly — this is a projector that you can take anywhere. There&apos;s no built-in battery on this model, but it is powered by USB-C, so what I do is just connect it to a power bank and play movies that way. Any 65W power bank will do, and if you&apos;re eyeing this projector, I recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BYP2F3SG"><strong>Anker Prime 250W 27,650mAh 3 Ports power bank that&apos;s 33% off for Prime Day</strong></a>.</p>
