                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S have a million different accessories to choose from, but some are better than others. While Soundcore is a trusted brand, its VR P10 earbuds are old news and only work properly with the Quest 2. Instead, you should get PrismXR Vega T1 headphones which just hit a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW"><strong>historic low price of $49.99</strong></a> on the day before Cyber Monday! The previous best price was $55.99 on Black Friday.</p><p>Aside from delivering ultra-low latency audio via the included USB-C dongle, PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds provide the full 27W passthrough capabilities it takes to keep the Quest 3 charged while playing. Soundcore VR P10 earbuds only offer 18W passthrough charging, which is <em>not enough</em> to charge the Quest 3, only to slow down the battery drain.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You are looking to keep VR play session audio in your ears only. The Quest's built-in speakers are great but sometimes it's better to not have the entire room hear the games you're playing, especially when they involve foul-mouthed gamers online. As a bonus, the USB-C dongle can be plugged into a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck for quicker wireless audio pairing than Bluetooth offers.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You find earbuds uncomfortable. PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds are super comfortable for me, but not everyone likes the feel of something in their ears.</p><p>PrismXR makes a ton of fantastic Meta Quest accessories including the Vega T1 earbuds. Aside from providing passthrough charging, Vega T1 earbuds offer ground-breaking 25ms latency for wireless audio. Comparatively, Bluetooth earbuds introduce between 50-100ms of latency which can be very uncomfortable in VR.</p><p>These earbuds come with a handy carrying case that keeps them charged — as you probably expect from a modern pair of wireless earbuds — so you don't have to worry about them being dead the next time you go to play.</p><p>Plus, with a great set of microphones on each bud, your friends will hear you better than ever before while gaming.</p>

Anker&apos;s chargers are the absolute best, but they usually cost a pretty penny. Lucky for you, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday</a> deal drives down the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R"><strong>Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN) by 46% on Amazon</strong></a>, so you can get it for roughly <strong>HALF</strong> the usual price. Talk about a bargain!</p><p>Anker makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a> in the industry. The brand&apos;s charging solutions might be pricey, but they never fall short of the mark. The name Anker screams reliability and high quality. If you need a phone charger, car charger, power bank, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/black-friday-chromebook-deals-2024-score-major-savings-on-acer-lenovo-samsung-and-more">Chromebook</a> charger, or cable, it&apos;s the right brand to choose.</p><p>GaN chargers are usually very compact and excellent at managing heat. That&apos;s why they are usually more expensive than regular old USB-C chargers. Naturally, when the rated power output and number of ports go up, so does the price. So if you need a new charger, I&apos;d say take advantage of this deal now, before stock runs out. It&apos;s already out of stock at Walmart!</p>

<p>This Anker Prime USB-C brick comes with three ports and pushes out 100W of power. That's plenty of ports and power to charge two to three devices at their max speeds, including laptops and Chromebooks. GaN technology keeps heat levels low and foldable prongs make this charger easy to store and carry. At 46%, this is the best Cyber Monday deal on an Anker product we've seen yet.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CZ6LXL8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7da4949c-aa2c-4807-ab4d-ce7c032f22b4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN): $84.99" data-dimension48="Anker Prime Charger (100W, 3 Ports, GaN): $84.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you charge multiple devices at once, especially laptops and Chromebooks that require 65W or higher; you need both USB-C and USB-A ports.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you still think $46 is too much for a charger.</p><p>The Anker Prime 100W GaN Charger is pretty small for a three-pronged charging brick. You get two USB-C and one USB-A port, as well as foldable prongs to reduce the compact charger&apos;s size even more.</p><p>Anker&apos;s proprietary PowerIQ 3.0 and Active Shield 2.0 technologies work together to deliver 100W of power intelligently, safely, and efficiently. The charger smartly chooses how much power to split and send to each port depending on how many ports and which exact ones are in use.</p><p>If you feel this deal still isn&apos;t worth your while, you might want to rethink your decision. You&apos;ll definitely find cheaper chargers, but not necessarily better or faster ones.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a powerful Bluetooth speaker with great sound and a bold design. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a speaker that's easy to carry anywhere.</p>
<p>The StormBox Blast has two 30W mid-woofers alongside dual 15W tweeters, and it produces 90W of sound. The sound quality is great out of the box, but if you need to tweak the bass or change the sound characteristics, you can easily do so with the Tribit app. Honestly, this thing gets loud enough to fill a medium-sized room, and there are zero issues when it comes to audio quality. <br><br>There's an XBass mode that cranks up the bass to a noticeable degree, and you don't get any distortion even with the volume all the way up. I averaged over 20 hours of music playback between charges, and I didn't have any problems with Bluetooth connectivity — it pairs over Bluetooth 5.3. <br><br>I also like the design quite a bit; it has 32 LEDs at the front, and they pulse according to the music. Interestingly, it has a power bank mode that lets you charge other devices with it, but it only goes up to 10W. There's IPX7 ingress protection as well, and you can easily use it outdoors or at the pool. The only quibble I have with it is that it takes too long to charge, but outside of that, the StormBox Blast is a phenomenal Bluetooth speaker, and you don't get anything that sounds as good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2">for $139 this Cyber Monday</a>.</p>

I had to travel recently, so instead of the Oasis, I took the Voyage. While the Voyage also has a similar-quality screen, the page turn buttons on the sides are woefully inadequate, and I hated using it. <br><br>That is the case with all new Kindles as well, with Amazon ditching physical page turn buttons altogether. Thankfully, DATAFY's accessory solves this problem; the accessory attaches to the side of the e-reader, and you can use the bundled remote control to physically turn pages on your Kindle. It's a novel solution, and it transforms how you use an e-reader. Best of all, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/DATAFY-Paperwhite-eReaders-Recording-Triggers/dp/B0CN6SSC17">just $15 right now</a>, so you're not spending too much cash either.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a page turner button to use with your e-reader. <br><strong><br>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need a button that goes to previous page as well as the next one.</p>
<p>The best part about the Oasis is the physical page-turn buttons; you just get much better tactility, and I got so used to the feature that I can't go back to a regular Kindle. It's annoying that Amazon doesn't sell the Oasis any longer, nor is there a new model that includes page turn buttons. The only alternative is to use an accessory like the DATAFY attachment, and to its credit, it does a great job. <br><br>The dongle attaches to the Kindle, and the page turning is by way of a remote that you hold in your hand. The remote uses an RF signal to connect to the dongle, and it doesn't need Bluetooth. Battery life is great, and it charges over USB-C. The only issue is that because it connects to one side, you can use it to go to the next page in a book; if you need to go back, you'll need to use the touch controls on the other side.</p>

The Balance has many pros to its name, but the best feature about this smartwatch is undoubtedly its battery life which goes up to 20 days.</p><p>This Cyber Monday deal brings down the price of the Amazfit Balance by a whopping 30%. If you want to take up on this offer, it&apos;s available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C7GGYS7M"><strong>Amazon for $139.99</strong></a>. For a wearable that usually costs about $200, that&apos;s an insanely good discount!</p><p>I just reviewed the Amazfit Balance and gave it a very good rating. What sets this watch apart is the AI features baked in, like Zepp Flow, Zepp Coach, and Zepp Aura. It uses AI to learn from your metrics and design strategies for you to hit your fitness goals smartly, based on the data collected.</p><p>The smartwatch also has plenty of watch faces, a solid companion app, and over 150 sports modes. Then there&apos;s also a ton of health tracking metrics such as heart rate monitoring, SpO2 monitoring, sleep tracking, menstrual tracking, and more! It&apos;s one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">best Amazfit smartwatches</a> for sure, and easy on the eyes too.</p>

<p>The Amazfit Balance destroys every other smartwatch when it comes to battery life. A single full charge can last you two to three weeks easily, so you will never have battery anxiety again. Other than that, the Balance is extremely lightweight, boasts 5ATM waterproofing, and comes with over 150 sports modes. With 30% off this Cyber Monday, the watch is cheaper than it has ever been.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you hate charging your wearable, require NFC for payments, want Alexa onboard, and like to track your health and fitness metrics.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want access to a lot more third-party apps and need an accurate pedometer as a serious sportsperson.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in a full-length evaluation of the Amazfit Balance, you can read my in-depth review. What I can summarize for you is that this is an excellent budget smartwatch that works really well for everyday use. This smartwatch has Alexa onboard, a built-in speaker and mic combo, as well as GPS and NFC for payments.</p><p>I also love the fact that you can store music locally on your Amazfit Balance and pair your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds with it directly. And if you forgot your earbuds, it just plays the music out loud through the watch&apos;s speaker.</p><p>Although the Amazfit Balance doesn&apos;t support hundreds and thousands of apps like Wear OS, the current selection of apps is decent enough. You can respond to messages on the notification bar with a full QWERTY keyboard too, which was not an option on older Amazfit smartwatches. It&apos;s not as capable as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, but still an excellent smart wearable for the price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have way too many cables in the house, and the biggest issue is the inevitable tangle when I have more than two cables on my desk. Thankfully, Baseus came to the rescue with this retractable USB-C cable, and I haven't used anything else in the past year. Having a retractable cable makes a huge difference in regular use; I don't need to worry about cluttering up my desk, and it's a more elegant solution. <br><br>The best part is that Baseus's retractable cable charges at 100W, making it a great choice to use with phones, notebooks, and just about any accessory. The cable has four preset lengths and goes up to two meters when fully extended, and it tucks away neatly when not in use. It usually costs $18, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0CZDJTRPZ">get it for $13 during Cyber Monday</a>, and that's a decent deal.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You need a retractable cable that can deliver 100W of power over the USB PD standard.<br><strong><br>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't care about the retractable design.</p>
<p>I used this cable for over a year now, and it is still going strong. What I like the most about it is the preset lengths; I usually have my phone on a stand and run a cable via the charging station, and one of the preset lengths on the cable is the ideal distance. The actual cable itself is flat, and it didn't have any problems delivering 100W of power to my devices. <br><br>It's good when transferring data between devices as well; I switch between phones every ten days on average, and I only used this cable to do so in the last year. The retractable mechanism is smooth, the case is made out of a matte texture, and overall, this is one of the best cables I have in the house. If you need a clutter-free cable with a retractable design, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Retractable-Charging-4-Stage-Charger/dp/B0CZDJTRPZ">now get it for just $13</a> — it holds up just as well in the car.</p>

<p>Pixel owners are facing a persistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> Quick Phrases bug, leaving annoying toast notifications on their screens.</p><p>Quick Phrases are meant to simplify voice commands like stopping alarms or handling calls. However, multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1h0x4z2/qpr2_beta_anyone_getting_the_quick_phrases_answer/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> are reporting about a lingering issue with Google Assistant’s 'Say Stop' prompt. Apparently, the notification refuses to disappear even after alarms or timers are turned off (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/29/pixel-quick-phrases-bug/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>In one instance, the bug has been spotted on a Pixel 8 running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. One user reported the 'Say Stop' prompt sticking around, even on the lock screen.</p><p>The issue isn’t tied to a specific device or software version, with users on both stable and beta Android 15 reporting the problem.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-say-answer-bug-fix-3504194/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has spotted a similar glitch on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> with the latest Android 15 update. When receiving a call, a toast notification popped up, asking users to "Say ‘Answer’".</p><p>While this notification was supposed to disappear once the call ends, it stuck around and locked up that area of the screen. Even worse, it covered the caller ID, making it hard to see who’s calling before you answer.</p><p>As 9to5Google pointed out, this ongoing issue seems to stem from the Google app, which powers both Gemini and Assistant. Until Google rolls out a fix, users might have to rely on temporary workarounds to deal with the annoying toast notification glitch.</p><p>Some users have found that restarting their device clears up the persistent bubble issue, while others have had luck disabling certain toggles in the Quick Phrases menu.</p><p>As a quick fix, Android Authority suggests force-closing and reopening the Google app (found in Settings > Apps > Google) to get rid of the persistent notification.</p><p>Alternatively, turning off the Quick Phrases feature can offer a more lasting solution, since force-stopping the Google app is just a temporary fix that might pop up again with future calls.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-in-one charger that doesn't take up much room and still manages to charge all of your tech. I used the Nexode Pro 160W for a year now, and it has been faultless. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don't need 140W charging. If you want a 100W GaN charger instead, I recommend this Anker charger instead, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-Compact-Foldable/dp/B09W2PNLX7">now available for $59</a>.</p>
<p>The Nexode Pro 160W is smaller than any of the other 140W GaN chargers I tested, and the foldable pins make it a great choice if you need to take it on the road. I used this charger every day throughout 2024, and didn't run into any issues whatsoever. I charged over a hundred different devices in that time — including 70 or so Android phones, a dozen tablets, my Steam Deck, and a smorgasbord of accessories. <br><br>It uses the USB PD 3.1 protocol to deliver 140W of power to the primary USB-C port, with the secondary USB-C port going up to 100W, and the third hitting 30W. When the two main USB-C ports are in use, you get 100W out of one and 60W out the other, and the 160W power budget should be ideal to charge a notebook and phone or any accessory like a Steam Deck, which only needs 35W. <br><br>With all ports in simultaneous use, you get a total power budget of 135W, with 65W each going to the primary USB-C ports, and 15W split evenly between the third USB-C and USB-A ports. Basically, you can charge a phone, notebook, smartwatch, and any other accessory just with a single charger. While there are dozens of products that do the same, the Nexode Pro 160W has been the most reliable in my testing, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">discount to $95</a>, it is a smidgen more affordable, and that's always a good thing.</p>

There are plenty of great options out there, like this large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-cant-live-without-this-25-000mah-power-bank-and-now-its-cheaper-than-its-ever-been-for-black-friday">25,000mAh UGREEN power bank with 145W charging</a>. However, you always have to take size into consideration, and the more capacity a power bank has, the larger it'll be. That's why I love this Anker Nano Power Bank (30W), which is on sale for Black Friday/Cyber Monday with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3/">25% discount</a>.</p><p>The Anker Nano Power Bank (30W) normally sells for $39.99, which already isn't bad for what you get. But for Black Friday/Cyber Monday, this 25% off deal brings it down to $29.99, a small but welcome discount for a surprisingly versatile power bank.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a power bank with plenty of power and easy portability thanks to its small size and looping USB-C cord.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want something that charges faster than 30W and has a larger capacity than 10,000mAh.</p><p>There's a lot to like about the Anker Nano Power Bank. The 10,000mAh capacity means I can charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-motorola-razr-plus-2024-deal-is-wild">Razr Plus 2024</a> at least twice, making it more than enough for me on any given day, particularly when at conventions and such. Then there's the fact that it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c" target="_blank">USB-C</a> and USB-A port since the former is the new standard, and the latter is still pretty common (just ask OnePlus).</p><p>The best part is that the attached USB-C cable loops into the device, making the power bank easy to carry around, whether that's just in your hand or looped onto your bag. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable chargers and power banks</a> go, it's incredibly convenient, as is the mini display on the side of the device that tells you how much time is left to charge your phone and how much capacity remains in the charger.</p><p>The 30W charging speed is also fast enough for some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ditch-your-boring-phone-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-6-now-more-than-usd300-off">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (25W) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-amazon-black-friday-sale-has-finally-fixed-the-google-pixel-9s-price-problem">Pixel 9</a> (27W). My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> charges at 45W and would still top up pretty quickly with the Anker Nano Power Bank, which is why I would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact power bank.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a portable speaker with great bass, long battery life, and a good design with support for high-quality audio codecs.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the best sound experience and want the option to utilize a 3.5mm audio jack or USB-C connection for audio playback.</p><p>I'm by no means an audiophile, so I see no point in paying top dollar to have the absolute best sound. I was hoping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVFKZ1LC">UE Boom 4</a> would satisfy my need for a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> to have at get-togethers, as I remember really liking my older UE Boom. That said, Amazon warned me that the product is frequently returned, and upon reading reviews, many people noted that the speaker was pretty lacking when it comes to bass, which is something I <em>do</em> need (a guy's gotta twerk).</p><p>That's when I remembered our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1 review</a>, which was done by Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong. I read through his review, as well as the reviews on Amazon, and decided this is exactly what I need. Granted, he is an audiophile, so his score is lower than the one on Amazon, but poor sound quality is not among his reasons. He notes a lack of USB-C audio and a 3.5mm audio jack as his main negatives.</p><p>As far as audio quality goes, Armstrong says the Sony ULT Field 1 sounds fine but a little flat if the UTL mode is turned off. However, he notes that "turning it on immediately imbues presence and depth to the sound, making the music fuller and more robust close-up and at greater distances like 50 feet." He even says the ULTE Field 1 is his new go-to take-along speaker.</p><p>Others in the Amazon reviews also note how it has good sound quality, with one review highlighting how the speaker is "<strong>LOUDDDDD as hell</strong>." That's all more than enough to convince me that this is the portable speaker that I need to buy.</p>
