<hr>
<p>Canada&apos;s Liberal government has revealed a $2.4 billion package aimed at boosting the country&apos;s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-government-ai-investment-1.7166234" target="_blank">CBC</a>, Canada&apos;s government intends to use its 2024 budget to funnel the money into ramping up computing power for the nation&apos;s AI researchers, startups, and scaleups.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that this investment will tap into AI&apos;s full potential by speeding up job creation in Canada&apos;s AI sector, as well as enhancing research and business productivity through its adoption.</p><p>The bulk of the investment (CA$2 billion) will go towards boosting compute capabilities and infrastructure. This support will benefit Canada&apos;s leading AI researchers and startups, leading to the establishment of the Canadian AI Sovereign Compute Strategy.</p><p>Currently, Canada relies heavily on privately owned computing systems, likely referring to cloud services offered by companies based outside the country. This raises security concerns, as the data stored on these systems could be vulnerable to foreign access.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland suggested at a Sunday press conference that the fund would allow Canada to store and process data within its own borders, potentially improving national security, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/federal-government-announces-2-billion-investment-to-support-ai-research-growth/article_eeb133b8-f4e8-11ee-a557-ab828d4f2cf1.html" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a>.</p><p>Freeland believes Canada has the resources to build its own supercomputing infrastructure. This includes access to clean electricity for powering the systems, skilled engineers to design and maintain them, a cold climate that can help with cooling, and ample space to house large facilities.</p><p>Additionally, CA$200 million will be distributed by Canada&apos;s Regional Development Agencies to incentivize AI startups and enhance AI integration across pivotal sectors like agriculture, healthcare, clean technology, and manufacturing.</p><p>Generative AI models, propelled by pioneers such as OpenAI with its ChatGPT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google&apos;s Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/un-global-ai-resolution">are rapidly advancing</a>. Canada appears eager to foster its own contender in this field.</p><p>The Canadian government is also establishing a $50 million AI safety institute. This institute will likely research and develop safeguards to mitigate risks posed by "advanced or nefarious AI systems."</p><p>An additional $5.1 million will be directed towards an office of the AI and Data Commissioner, whose role would likely be to enforce the proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act. This act would set guidelines and regulations around the development, use, and oversight of AI in Canada.</p>

The black Bespoke Edition of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Sapphire-Titanium/dp/B0BVGS4FM2"><strong>selling at Amazon with an outstanding 38% discount</strong></a>, offering buyers a powerful smartwatch with excellent battery life at just $278. Similarly, the black ridge band version of the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is 37% off at a sale price of $281.99. The exact Amazon discount keeps fluctuating for the watch, so don&apos;t wait too long if this price sounds good to you. Â </p><p>The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro was rated the "best premium pick" on our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-premium-pick">best Android watches</a>, and there&apos;s more than one reason why. The battery life, for instance, can last up to 80 hours if you aren&apos;t using power-draining features like the always-on display (AOD) or the constantly-listening Google Assistant. Even with these on, the Watch 5 Pro performs pretty well, and it comes with impressively fast 10W charging, along with several other features that users love.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> is an excellent pick as far as smartwatches go, and at over $170 off the purchase price, this is a certifiably good deal. Get up to three days of battery life, super-quick 10W charging, and a number of userful fitness and health sensors. Even though this isn't Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch generation, it still holds up to the hype of the newer models, especially since it's been updated with the user-friendly Wear OS 4.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch5-pro-titanium-smartwatch-45mm-bt-black/6510873.p">Best Buy - $449.99</a><strong> |</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch5-Pro-45mm-Smart-Watch-Bluetooth-Black-Titanium/1401202059">Walmart - $449.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVGS4FM2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fe439bc2-6d0c-4bc1-aaf5-31904868cd1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$449.99" data-dimension48="$449.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>âRecommended if:</strong>Â you want a watch that has superior battery life; you liked the Wear OS software on other Samsung Galaxy Watch generations; you&apos;re looking for a sleek, black smartwatch that&apos;s durable enough to take with you on outdoor excursions.</p><p><strong>âSkip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a slightly less wide band and think you might like the 40mm better than the 45mm band; you&apos;re hoping to save even more money on a less premium smartwatch; you want something small and easy to sleep with.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro holds up well to the newer generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, still offering even better battery life and plenty of health monitoring tools for the average user. Without using active battery-draining features, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro can get access to as many as 80 hours of battery life per charge, while charging up super quickly with the 10W charging.</p><p>Like any watch, the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro does come with a few caveats that could be deal-breakers for some. As one example, some found it too thick and heavy to sleep with, despite including easy-to-use sleep monitoring tools. It&apos;s also pretty pricey when compared with the non-Pro option, though this deal makes it a little more doable.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There are three main ways to make a smartwatch last longer than a day. Fitness watches with weeks-long battery life have the easiest method: use a wimpy, efficient CPU that sticks to health data and notifications. The other two solutions for longer smartwatch battery life come with drawbacks and compromises, and I&apos;m not sure that&apos;ll ever change.</p><p>Smartwatch makers know we&apos;re sick of recharging our watches daily. They&apos;ve sped up charging times in recent years so you can top them off quickly before or after bed, making it easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">sleep with a watch</a>. For many, that stopgap measure isn&apos;t enough, and they switch to "dumber" watches from Garmin or Fitbit to avoid the hassle.</p><p>Apple doesn&apos;t make its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Series watches</a> last 18 hours year after year for kicks. It can&apos;t take a year off from adding new, battery-guzzling features or sensors without consumer apathy and stockholder panic. Nor can it add extra battery capacity without ruining the design.</p><p>Wear OS watches have done better, to an extent. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>&apos;s 40-hour battery is certainly an improvement â even if it&apos;s a 10-hour drop-off from last year â and the 24-hour <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> does, at least, make it easier to pick a consistent time to charge it.Â </p><p>The problems arise whenever you try to last any longer than that.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve followed my weekly column, you know I prefer fitness watches to traditional smartwatches, mainly for running metrics and battery life. I <em>do</em> miss the option of proper wrist apps, though. That&apos;s why two of my favorite smartwatches of the last two years are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.</p><p>The Watch 5 Pro and Ultra 2 hit 80 and 36 hours, respectively, well beyond the norm for smartwatches. Equally important for my purposes, they&apos;re supposed to last 20 or 12 hours while tracking your GPS location for workouts â in the same ballpark as a Garmin watch.Â We&apos;ve also heard that Samsung will bring back the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-could-get-better-battery-life">slightly larger battery</a>.</p><p>Aside from costing an arm and a leg, what&apos;s the downside to these watches? Once you factor in the watch band, both smartwatch flagships weigh about 2.5â3oz, more than double the weight of your typical fitness tracker.Â </p><p>Regular smartwatches keep steadily gaining weight, even if it&apos;s usually only a gram per year, like the Galaxy Watch 4 (26g) versus the Watch 6 (29g). They keep squeezing in more components and battery capacity, like subtle weight training for our wrists. But to double your battery life, you also have to double the weight.</p>

<p>Tech brands know that their target audience â eager tech fans who read sites like ours and always need the latest flagship model, plus credulous journalists getting $800 watches for free â will accept wearing a giant chunk of metal on their wrists for extra battery life. When people complain that their mainline watches die quickly, Apple and Samsung can point to their well-reviewed premium watches and call you a "power user" who should spend more.</p><p>Again, I love that these watches finally "solved" smartwatches&apos; core flaw for me. But some people can&apos;t afford that solution, and others don&apos;t have enough wrists to <em>wear</em> the solution. And so long as these high-end models exist, smartwatch brands have little incentive to make the cheaper models more efficient. Packing in flashy new features is the higher priority.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> blew us away when it first launched, consistently lasting four days per charge. The more we used it, however, the more we realized that the longer battery life came with serious tradeoffs.</p><p>OnePlus credited its longevity to a dual-processor design: the 4nm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> chip handles the heavy-duty app tasks, while its 12nm BES2700 co-processor handles "background tasks" like notifications and health data via the lightweight RTOS. Google and OnePlus worked together to make this system work, calling it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a>.</p><p>It sounds great in theory, but in practice, two AC reviewers found that it undercounts steps by thousands across a busy day, claims you&apos;re standing when you&apos;re sitting, overreports stress on calm days, and can&apos;t properly track higher anaerobic heart rates during workouts. It also failed to deliver notifications, sometimes.</p><p>These issues stem directly from OnePlus&apos; hybrid OS system. Its co-processor struggles to sample your health data quickly enough, either by design to save battery life or due to its clock limitations. Either way, it undercuts one of the main reasons to wear a smartwatch.</p><p>OnePlus also saves battery life by using Google&apos;s special XML Watch Face Format, which saves battery life. The only problem is that our reviewer found the watch faces boring, and when he tried installing a custom one with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-facer-on-pixel-watch">Facer</a>, it cut his watch&apos;s battery life from four days to <em>one</em>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-12.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 watch face highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/And47YJoT6qUsEGZVf5LXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is relatively new to the smartwatch game, and other brands like Google or Apple might handle hybrid systems better. Relegating background tasks to a more efficient chip is probably the only way that smartwatches <em>could</em> last longer.</p><p>I simply can&apos;t take it for granted that the compromises of a hybrid system won&apos;t outweigh the benefits. Most smartwatches already have a power-saving mode, and a hybrid mode feels like a rebranding of that same principle: disabling battery-guzzling features and slowing the sampling rate for your heart rate or location. And I don&apos;t see much point in wearing a heavy smartwatch if you&apos;re not going to use its smarts.</p><p>If smartwatches of the future can track dozens of health metrics in the background using a low-powered chip while extending battery life, that&apos;d be fantastic! But I&apos;m skeptical that tech brands can pull it off without making your data too inconsistent to be reliable; let&apos;s hope I&apos;m proven wrong.</p>

<p>This is the year of AI, at least on smartphones. What this means for smartwatches and their battery life isn&apos;t certain yet.</p>
<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> essentially replacing Google Assistant on Android phones, it feels like only a matter of time until these same brands try to get Gemini and other AI features on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>. Of course, most AI versions today rely on cloud-based computing, and pulling data from wi-fi drains a watch&apos;s battery pretty quickly.</p><p>Other AI features will work in the back end. We know that Samsung plans to introduce a "Vitality Score" this summer for the Galaxy Watch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, based on your sleep and health data. And if I&apos;m going to rely on this data, I&apos;d rather my watch get the most accurate data possible, not check in at random intervals to save battery.</p><p>Ultimately, my guess is that smartwatch chips will start becoming more and more like phone chips, with multiple cores and processors and AI-focused NPUs all chugging along on your wrist, adding more and more features over time. We&apos;ll see what kind of impact that has on smartwatch battery life, but I think breaking even is about all we can hope for.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio releases a lot of gear over the course of the year, and when the brand announced that it was coming out with the Q15, I thought it would be a higher-end model of the Q7. But the Bluetooth DAC costs half as much as the Q7, while retaining a similar design â albeit in a smaller size â and a lot of similar features.</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it&apos;s because Fiio has made a habit out of doing this. The K9 DAC also goes the same route, offering the same design and a ton of the same features as the flagship K9 Pro, but for a lot less. Clearly, Fiio is looking to flesh out its DAC portfolio and list products in all price segments, and in that context, the Q15 makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ" name="fiio-q15-2.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ReuhYf2Qnf3EMSVCZF6KQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth-LDAC%EF%BC%8C1600mW/dp/B0CMWBZK8J">retailing at $399 on Amazon</a>, and that is less than half of what the Q7 costs. When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-q7-review">reviewed the Q7</a>, I called it an endgame DAC that had everything you could want in a portable DAC. Fiio hasn&apos;t changed too many things with the Q15; in fact, the biggest omission is the lack of a 6.35mm port â the DAC just isn&apos;t big enough to accommodate the jack. Otherwise, the Q15 is able to deliver 1.6W of power, uses AKM hardware, and has all the AptX codecs you need.</p>

<p>Other than that, it retains a similar design as the Q7, and you get a bold aesthetic with jagged edges that looks striking. What&apos;s great is that you now get a titanium color option, so if you don&apos;t like the look of the standard black model, the titanium variant looks much more pleasing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT" name="fiio-q15-20.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JFSB78P785KnGNo7Yia9PT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 305g, the Q15 is less than half the weight of the Q7, and that makes it a great choice if you need a portable DAC. The biggest design difference is at the back, where Fiio switched out the leather back of the Q7 with a frosted glass back that feels great to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ" name="fiio-q15-3.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rwnJXEakLEbg7aayxsKdUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has a glossy insert that takes up a considerable amount of the real estate, and the 1.3-inch TFT panel is housed within the island. Fiio is reusing the same panel as the Q7, and it has the same size and resolution of 240 x 240. The panel lets you change modes â you get USB, coaxial, and Bluetooth â and you can access the settings with a long press of the volume knob, giving you access to gain, max volume, filters, and EQ. You get the same Hi-Res labels as the Q7, but there&apos;s no THX branding.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fAnWUzQxuWetouS5wmPBtR" name="fiio-q15-13.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fAnWUzQxuWetouS5wmPBtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The menu interface is basic, but it gives you easy access to all the features of the DAC without having to pull up Fiio&apos;s Control mobile app. This is a small tweak, but I like that the settings menu now has a back button that lets you go back to the source page.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ZqmQ7q5ScTrCpczVCTijR" name="fiio-q15-12.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZqmQ7q5ScTrCpczVCTijR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio includes a carrying pouch with the Q15, but I would have liked to see a case similar to that of the Q7. But given the positioning of the Q15, you don&apos;t get one in the box. Other than the case, you get two USB-C to USB-C cables, a USB-A dongle, and two silicone bands that let you attach the Q15 to a phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR" name="fiio-q15-8.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jcNvte36Z6KuSgcBqMdTAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality of the Q15 is phenomenal; the DAC has an all-metal chassis that uses aluminum, and in the three months I had the unit, I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever. I like the texture volume knob too, as it makes changing the volume easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ" name="fiio-q15-4.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3PTN7NNqNKrT2csiqV87cQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Q15 has a 3.5mm single-ended port and a balanced 4.4mm port that are located on either side of the large volume knob, and as is usually the case with most Fiio products, there&apos;s an LED ring that encircles the volume knob. The Q7 gets 2.5mm and 6.35mm connectors as well, but considering the use case of the Q15, a single-ended and balanced connector are more than adequate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ" name="fiio-q15-5.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPwUkyiTcr9xvnhXxxHjsQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to the Q7, you get control buttons on the Q15, but they&apos;re now located on the left; there&apos;s a power button, and three buttons to control music playback. At the bottom is where you see the various ports; the Q15 has coaxial and USB connectors, and there&apos;s a second USB-C port that can be used to charge the DAC. By contrast, the Q7 has a single USB-C port to connect and charge the DAC, and it has an optical port in addition to coaxial.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR" name="fiio-q15-11.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBxVGSiwbh8sVWmPEv4UbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what&apos;s great is that you can switch between modes easily via toggles located at the bottom. You can use the Q15 in desktop mode, and it doesn&apos;t use the built-in battery in this mode. There&apos;s a phone mode as well, and in this mode, the Q15 uses its built-in battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS" name="fiio-q15-22.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SvCe82P5nZ9HNsqmKEabS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that subject, the Q15 has a 5500mAh battery that delivers just over nine hours of music playback over the balanced 4.4mm port, and eight hours on the 3.5mm jack. It takes over three and a half hours to charge the DAC, so it isn&apos;t something you&apos;ll want to do during the day. It goes up to 15W when using a USB PD charger, and I left the unit charging overnight most of the time.</p>

<p>Given that the Q7 has one of the best sound signatures of any portable DAC, the Q15 has a lot to offer in this area, and it is off to a promising start. The DAC uses a combination of AKM&apos;s AK4191EQ and AK4499EX, and they&apos;re joined by the Qualcomm QCC5125, which oversees the Bluetooth side of things.</p>

<p>The Q15 includes all the AptX codecs â AptX, AptX HD, AptX LL, and AptX Adaptive â in addition to LDAC, and in USB mode, it is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. If you use the coaxial connector, it goes up to 192kHz/24-bit and DSD64.</p>

<p>It&apos;s the power on offer that makes the Q15 such a great choice; the DAC is able to deliver 1600mW of power, and that allows it to drive any IEM and headset in the market today. I used it with the Audeze LCD-GX, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and about a dozen IEMs over the course of the last three months, and didn&apos;t run into any issues.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity makes the Q15 about as easy to use as possible with a phone, and with most Android devices offering LDAC natively â Google baked it into Android several years ago â you will get 96kHz/32-bit playback over Bluetooth without any hassle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS" name="fiio-q15-19.jpg" alt="Fiio Q15 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sit6RZBrH4quMKrHY7W7mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the Q15 doesn&apos;t have any audible hiss, so even sensitive IEMs are a good pairing with the DAC. Like other Fiio DACs, the Q15 has a neutral sound that doesn&apos;t add any coloration. That said, going with AKM over the usual ESS Sabre models means you get a slightly different sound profile, with increased vibrancy in the low-end.</p><p>The bass is wonderfully detailed and textured when using the FT5, and there is a slight exuberance in the sub-bass region that makes using the Q15 that much more enjoyable. The mids are natural and have plenty of character, and the treble has good extension. The imaging and dynamics are excellent, and the Q15 is the latest in a long list of Fiio DACs that absolutely nails the technical details.</p>

<p>Just like the K9, the Q15 is a value leader. Yes, the Q7 has better tonality and does a better job driving endgame headsets, but if you just need a Bluetooth DAC to use with IEMs and most headsets under $1,000, it does an incredible job. The feature-set is nearly identical to what you&apos;re getting on the Q7, and the affordability makes the Q15 a no-brainer.</p>

<p>When a total solar eclipse happens, the moon slides right between Earth and the sun. This means the moon will completely block the sun for a few minutes, turning daytime into twilight (how long depends on your viewing spot).</p><p>This eclipse is set to be a blockbuster, with tens of millions of people residing along the path of totality. This path stretches across Northern America, spanning 115 miles wide, where the moon will pull off the ultimate cover-up, blocking out 100% of the sun&apos;s disk.</p><p>If you&apos;re lucky enough to be there, you won&apos;t want to miss it. And while at that, there are a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses">few cheap solar glasses with which you can watch the eclipse</a>.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/2024-solar-eclipse-map-where-to-see-the-eclipse-on-april-8" target="_blank">Live Science</a>, this cosmic journey kicks off in Sinaloa, Mexico, and then heads northeast, trekking through Texas before cruising through 15 states. Finally, it bids farewell to the U.S. as it heads north into Canada.</p><p>The states along the way where you&apos;ll catch totality are: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p><p>That said, Tennessee and Michigan will only get a quick peek at the moon&apos;s shadow passing by.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com/visitation" target="_blank">Great American Eclipse website</a>, around 1 to 4 million Americans are expected to travel for this stellar event. If you&apos;re not in that specific stretch or prefer to enjoy the action from your couch, don&apos;t fret.

<hr>
<p>Meta is asking for a U.S. antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to be thrown out due to a lack of evidence, according to a motion for summary judgment filed Friday, April 5. The case centers around whether Meta exerts monopolistic power in the social media industry due to its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. If successful, Meta would be forced to divest (in other words, sell) WhatsApp and Instagram, effectively reversing the acquisitions.Â </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ftc-lawsuit-could-force-facebook-give-instagram-and-whatsapp">original complaint</a> was filed by the FTC in 2020, but it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-antitrust-cases-dismissed">dismissed</a> due to insufficient evidence. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ftc-files-amended-complaint-against-facebook">revised complaint was submitted in 2021</a>, and the legal battle has ensued to date. Meta is now asking for the case to be dismissed again for the same reason, hoping to avoid a trial.Â </p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-in-ftc-lawsuit-relating-to-instagram-and-whatsapp/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the company explained its reasoning for the motion to dismiss. "We&apos;ve asked the court to dismiss the case because the FTC has failed to provide evidence to support its claims," said Jennifer Newstead, Meta&apos;s chief legal officer. "The evidence instead shows that we face fierce competition from a range of platforms and that our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have benefited consumers."</p><p>The FTC is joined by the attorneys general of 48 U.S. states, who together claim that the purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 were anti-competitive. The same agency approved both acquisitions before they were completed and is now trying to reverse that decision.Â </p><p>"The decision to revisit done deals is tantamount to announcing that no sale will ever be final," adds Newstead, who goes on to say that this lawsuit "will also make companies think twice about investing in innovation, since they may be punished if that innovation leads to success."</p><p>The official complaint calls into question the FTC&apos;s antitrust market, which is described as "personal social networking services," or PSNS. The FTC claims that this market exists, but it includes only four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe. Meta disputes this notion by saying that consumers turn to services such as TikTok, YouTube, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn for many of the same offerings that Meta apps provide.Â </p><p>Meta also rejects the claim that it has monopoly power, in part because it does not see the FTC&apos;s antitrust market as valid. Additionally, it believes the company cannot be considered a monopoly because it has "never charged a price and never restricted output."</p><p>"From the very beginning, the FTC has failed to state a plausible claim, and the agency has done nothing to build its case through the discovery process to prove otherwise," said Newstead.</p><p>Now, the FTC can make its case for why the lawsuit should continue. After deliberation, the court can either rule in Meta&apos;s favor and toss out the complaint, or continue toward a trial.Â </p>

Something new that watch users can look out for is the vibration feature, and as the name suggests, users will notice the current time play in haptics whenever a user chooses to use gestures on the watch face.</p><p>Additionally, it also got improvements in auto brightness functionality, allowing "users to perceive the difference when switching levels easily." Another feature to look out for is the new progress bar for app downloads/ updates done via Google Play Store, which isn&apos;t officially included, but it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-could-gain-a-new-app-download-indicator">spotted</a> by some Pixel watch users recently.Â </p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel phone users also get their own set of updates at the same time. The update includes 28 general security patches for Android and another 25 that are exclusively for Pixel devices.Â </p><p>You can check if your Pixel phone has the April 2024 update by navigating toÂ <strong>Settings > System > Software update</strong>.Â </p>

The Bloomberg report claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming service</a> might be raising the price for its &apos;basic&apos; plan by a dollar and its duo plan by $2 in certain markets worldwide. This means that subscribers in the UK, Australia, and Pakistan will see these increases take effect by the end of April. The U.S. is also expected to see this price hike later this year. Spotify is also looking into adding more subscription plans for consumers to drive revenue.Â </p><p>Speculations around Spotify working on a new "basic" tier with music and podcasts, and without audiobooks, have also been making the rounds. This plan may cost $11, the same as the premium plan for a solo user.</p><p>A new "Supremium" plan was briefly mentioned in the report that allows users to stream HiFi audio for a steeper price.</p>

But for now, it&apos;s best if S23 users might want to steer clear of the One UI 6.1 update if it can be helped.</p>

However, Google may have made cross-checking this a bit easier.Â </p><p>April 2 is seen as International Fact-Checking Day, and Google is expanding the reach of some of its most useful tools in Google Search for verifying facts, images, and sources. In addition, GoogleÂ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-fact-checking-resources/">announced</a>Â that its Fact Check Explorer is exiting beta and will be available to all.</p><p>Two familiar Google search features, About this image and About this page, are now available in 40 more languages globally. When it comes to About this image, when you open an image&apos;s detail menu in Search and tap the About this image option, you&apos;ll be able to learn more about an image and where it came from.</p><p>Specifically, Google says that About this image can list the following types of information about an image in Search: the history of an image, how the image is used and described by other sites, and the metadata associated with an image. This could reveal whether an image was AI-generated or came from an untrustworthy source.</p><p>Similarly,Â <strong>About this page</strong>Â andÂ <strong>About this resultÂ </strong>will display more information about a website before you decide to click on a Google Search result. This could reveal whether the site is trustworthy, if it is believed to be biased in some way, and who owns it.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 8a was spotted in an advertisement ahead of its expected launch.</li><li>The device can be seen in two colorways with a matte finish frame.</li><li>The Pixel 8a is expected to launch at Google I/O 2024 on May 14 with a Tensor G3 chipset.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Pixel 8a is Google&apos;s next highly anticipated product launch, and it&apos;s expected to appear at Google I/O in May. However, a recent Google Fi ad appears to give us an official look at the Pixel 8a in two different colorways.</p><p>As seen on YouTube and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/is_the_google_pixel_8a_hiding_in_plain_sight-news-62309.php">GSMArena</a>, the ad showed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a</a> in what appears to be Porcelain and Bay color variants, similar options to what we&apos;ve seen on the current Pixel 8 devices.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/thpjxUZol1o" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>While the ad doesn&apos;t specifically say that the showcased phones are the Pixel 8a devices, the curved corners, and thinner camera visor seem to match what we&apos;ve seen in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-leaked-renders">previous renders</a> of the device, which are quite different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>. GSMArena also points to the rear mic placement, which seems to differ from other Pixel models and is not visible on the camera visor, as seen in earlier renders.</p><p>While it&apos;s possible the rear phone could be the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 8a renders seems to show a matte frame, whereas the Pixel 8 Pro comes with a glossy finish. The signs seem to point to this being the Pixel 8a, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-pixel-8-should-you-buy">Pixel 8 is not available in blue</a> (it&apos;s exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>), although for now, you should take this with a grain of salt until the official launch.</p>
<p>Overall, the upcoming Pixel 8a is expected to be pricier than its predecessor. Underneath, the Tensor G3 chip will likely power it, and some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-rumored-to-have-a-bigger-battery">recent certifications</a> have assured that the Pixel 8a would sport a bigger battery as well.</p><p>The Google I/O is slated for May 14, 2024, when we might get our first official look at the Pixel 8a alongside other devices.</p>

It&apos;s a pretty big deal if you&apos;re in North America, and it should be a spectacular show in much of the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>This one won&apos;t be right over my house like the eclipse from 2017 was, but it will be close enough that I want to make sure I&apos;m prepared to get at least one really good photograph of it. In 2017, phone cameras kind of sucked, and most of my pics from back then are pretty trash. In 2024, I can do better. We all can do better!</p>

<p>The hardest part of getting good eclipse photos is making sure you&apos;re in the right place at the right time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eclipse-explorer.smce.nasa.gov/">NASA has a great interactive map</a> showing where and when, and if you live in or around places like Dallas, Memphis, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Toronto, or Montreal, you&apos;re in for a treat. If you live on the West Coast or southeast U.S., you probably won&apos;t see anything worth taking a photo of.</p><p>You can&apos;t just run outside, point your phone (or your eyes) at the sun, and start taking pictures. that&apos;s a good way to hurt your eyes and maybe even burn your phone camera&apos;s sensor. Fortunately, the gear you need is cheap. More importantly, the way to do it is super simple.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-and-how-to-do-it-2">What you need and how to do it</h2>

<p>The internet is full of great advice about taking pictures of the eclipse. <em>Really</em> full. That&apos;s great and highlights what a cool resource the internet can be, but it can be a little overwhelming.</p><p>If you want to know how it works or techniques for professional photographs, Google everything you can. Some of the articles out there are full of awesome stuff, and I&apos;ve enjoyed reading through them. Even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/photograph-solar-eclipse-google-pixel/">Google is talking about</a> ways to get a great image from your Pixel phone.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s get simple though. You need four things before you can take good photos of an eclipse:Â </p>
<ul><li><strong>Your phone:</strong> You're going to get better results from a phone geared towards photography like a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> or a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, but the phone you have in your hand will work. I'm not saying you should rush out to buy a new phone, just know budget phones aren't going to take photos like the ones you'll find on Instagram the day after.</li><li><strong>A tripod</strong>. If you want to go that route, you can get a good cheap phone tripod on Amazon in time for the eclipse. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aureday-Wireless-Extendable-Recording-Streaming/dp/B0C1MC68M7">this one</a>, and I like it. You can also fashion a tripod using a phone mount and something sturdy. Find a way to hold your phone steady while it's pointed at the sky.</li><li><strong>A lens filter</strong>. Some say you can't damage a phone camera by pointing it at the sun. Some people say you will. I can tell you that the phone cameras of 2017 can be damaged by taking pictures of the sun because it happened to me using an HTC U11. I suggest you play it safe and buy a specially designed-filter <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Solar-Imaging-Enhancing-Photo/dp/B0CFBX3KNN/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a>. It also makes getting pictures easier because you can see what you're doing through the screen. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-the-eclipse-through-your-smartphone-with-these-cheap-solar-glasses"><strong>NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN WITHOUT EYE PROTECTION</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1324px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU" name="perfect-eclipse.png" alt="Don't look at the sun" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q24NMymgNm8QGfBcmTuLpU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1324" height="744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Getty)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, you need to know how to use the manual settings on your phone&apos;s camera. Take the time to learn how to do two things: turn off the flash and adjust the brightness. If you can, turn off things like "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ultra-hdr-explained">Ultra HDR</a>" if your phone has them. Phone camera AI can and will ruin your eclipse shots if you let it.</p><p>With this gear at the ready and knowing how to adjust a few camera settings, taking the picture is easy. Find a good spot to keep your tripod or homemade rig steady and get set up. Remember, it will be dark for a few minutes, so be careful not to trip or knock anything over.</p><p>Now, get ready to take some photos of the eclipse:</p>
<ul><li>Get your phone on the tripod and make sure you have a good view of the sky.</li><li>Attach the phone camera filter according to the directions that came with it. Masking tape might be your best friend here.</li><li>Don't use digital camera zoom. If your phone has a zoom or telephoto lens, use it. Pinching all the way in is a good way to get a grainy photo. Remember, it will be mostly dark, and you won't be using the flash.</li><li>Find the sun before the eclipse starts and focus on it.Â </li><li>Use the manual settings to lower the brightness until you see a crisp outline of the sun on a very dark background.</li><li>When the eclipse starts, try not to move things too much when you tap to take the photo. If you do, take a second or two and set it up again. You can also use a remote shutter for your phone's camera <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Bluetooth-Shutter-Android-Wireless/dp/B084VTFS4X/ref=sr_1_1">like this one</a> instead of touching the screen to take a picture.</li><li>Take <em>a lot</em> of pictures.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB" name="Photoshop.jpg" alt="Adobe Photoshop logo on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y9GKfDhUB9jZ8YhHiqbHHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a couple of things you should do after the eclipse. Sort through all of your pictures on the best screen you can find, keeping every one that looks OK. These are the pictures you want to run through editing software.Â </p><p>You can find plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">photo editing software</a> for your phone, and some of the available apps work really well. Alternatively, you can transfer the pictures to another computer and edit them. Just be prepared to adjust the sharpening and exposure to make your good photos great.</p>
<p>You should back them up, too. If you have your own backup solution with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">NAS in your house</a>, use it. Use online backup, too; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> is great (and comes with a pretty good built-in editor), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-photos-best-photo-storage-service-youre-not-using">Amazon Photos</a> is good, too. Make sure to keep them somewhere besides on your phone.</p><p>Finally, remember to share them. You think pictures of the eclipse are cool, which is why you took them. Plenty of folks feel the same (guilty), and we want to see your pictures!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Fiio started focusing on the high-end segment two years ago, and that led to a deluge of premium products, including DACs, IEMs that used a combination of three different driver units, and network streamers. While these products were aimed at the high-end segment, they still delivered a great feature-set, and undercut their rivals by a considerable margin.</p><p>Nothing illustrates this as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">K9 Pro DAC</a>; Fiio did all the right things with the product, and having used it for over a year and a half, I&apos;m convinced that there isn&apos;t anything better at this price point. The only downside is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Amplifier-Headphone-Bluetooth-Resolution/dp/B09PDM588T">K9 Pro still costs $849</a>, making it inaccessible to a mainstream audience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo" name="fiio-k9-2.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAPe5yF5vG3j4vi3kkmbo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s where the K9 comes into the equation. Fiio rolled out the K9 last year, and at the outset, there really isn&apos;t much of a difference between the standard model and the K9 Pro; both use similar ESS DACs, THX amps, Bluetooth connectivity with the same set of codecs, and an identical design. The difference is that the K9 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K9-Headphone-Amplifier-Bluetooth/dp/B0C13XK1WC">available for $499</a>, just over half the asking price of the K9 Pro.</p>

<p>Obviously, Fiio designed the K9 to slot into the mid-range segment, filling the void between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">$200 K7</a> and $849 K9 Pro. But by retaining the same design and a lot of the same features as the costlier K9 Pro, Fiio is running the risk of cannibalizing its high-end product, because after using the K9 for six months, I don&apos;t really see the need for buying the K9 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting with the design, the K9 uses the same chassis as the K9 Pro, and this is something Fiio is prone to doing. It did the same with the K7, which retained the chassis of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">K5 Pro</a>, and at the time, the brand noted it was to save manufacturing costs and make it easier to get the product out the door.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4" name="fiio-k9-10.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdAnzMLWZFZfhwqkDzzaD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, the brand is using the same strategy here, and the K9 is nearly identical to the K9 Pro. The only difference is the lack of the Pro branding at the front of the unit, and the volume dial that dominates the front fascia doesn&apos;t have gold accents. That said, the labels underneath all the connectors and button are now in white and have better contrast, and they&apos;re significantly easier to read. This continues to be an issue on the K9 Pro, with the grey labels merging with the black chassis, making it hard to make out any of the markings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4" name="fiio-k9-14.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmhQqxwRD5wMp6xV9oCPt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 has the same connectors up front, so you get a balanced 4.4mm port, 4-pin XLR that has a dust cover, and a single-ended 6.35mm connector. The status LED highlights the mode in use, and you can use USB, optical, coaxial, line in, and Bluetooth. At the bottom, you get the power button, gain toggle â high, medium, and low â along with an input selector, and output toggle that lets you use the K9 as a dedicated DAC, headphone out, or in a configuration that sees it acting as a preamp.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4" name="fiio-k9-11.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUm4NyPBEs8oybnCMiDvP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given that the K9 uses the same black chassis as the Pro model, it doesn&apos;t really draw much attention to itself. Both sides of the unit have a vented design to deliver passive airflow, and this is needed because there&apos;s no active cooling. You get the same THX branding at the top, but it isn&apos;t embossed, and the new Fiio logo is etched above.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54" name="fiio-k9-9.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTfQ6KfUcDufdbiKqkYA54.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s at the back where things get interesting, with the K9 offering the same set of connectivity options as the K9 Pro. You get an antenna to deliver a stable Bluetooth signal, and there are USB-B, coaxial, and optical inputs along with a 4.4mm balanced and the traditional RCA. You also get RCA and 3-pin XLR out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3" name="fiio-k9-7.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTdX67VUnFVRQi7JBBu3h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only thing missing on the K9 is USB-C connectivity, and MQA rendering. While I would have liked to see USB-C, it isn&apos;t a big deal, and honestly, you get a ton of other ports on the DAC. MQA is used mostly by Tidal, and as the standard itself is out of favor, its omission doesn&apos;t actually mean anything.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3" name="fiio-k9-8.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5mmjnZRHbEfydaJg626u3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the K9 retaining the same design is that it can be mounted in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and you get a stand in the package that lets you mount it vertically. Coming in at 5.7lb (2.6kg), it is just as heavy as the K9 Pro, and it isn&apos;t designed with portability. The package contains a USB cable, 3.5mm to 6.35mm connector, and an additional fuse.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kpVm7WHdqFWdH7MofkP4G6" name="fiio-k9-22.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpVm7WHdqFWdH7MofkP4G6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FiiO Control app continues to be great, and it gives you exhaustive control over just about every area of the K9. You can see the active mode, select Bluetooth audio codecs, adjust the lighting around the volume knob, set EQ, and adjust the channel balance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5" name="fiio-k9-17.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CypFupoPDJPXpfXVXJPNP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the audio side of things, the K9 uses two 32-bit ESS Sabre ES9068AS DACs. The 2-channel DAC sits one tier below the ES9038 Pro that&apos;s featured in the K9 Pro, but you don&apos;t really notice much in the way of difference between the two in daily use. You once again get two THX AAA 788+ amps, and the K9 utilizes the same Qualcomm QCC5124 Bluetooth modem as its costlier sibling to deliver Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5" name="fiio-k9-21.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLLfw35kPvtLKSNmHbwkt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about Bluetooth, you get all the audio codecs you&apos;ll ever need: AptX, AptX LL, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, and LDAC. The LED light on the volume knob changes based on the codec in use, and it is a good visual indicator.</p><p>When used in USB mode, the K9 is able to go up to 768kHz/32-bit over PCM and DSD512. That goes down to 192kHz/24-bit over coaxial, and 96kHz/24-bit via optical. The K9 is an all-in-one device, and it has plenty of power to drive just about any audio device, including the most demanding planar headsets. Conversely, it is able to power sensitive IEMs without any issues whatsoever â all you&apos;ll need to do is set the gain to low.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5" name="fiio-k9-16.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAc26umtnc69d3QoSX5LD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The K9 is able to deliver up to 1W of power at 16Î©, 1.5W at 32Î©, and 200mW at 300Î© over the 6.35mm port. Switching to the balanced 4.4mm and XLR ports, you get 1W of power at 16Î©, 2W at 32Î©, and 780mW at 300Î©. I tested the K9 with plenty of headsets, including the outstanding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a>, Audeze LCD-GX, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">Fiio&apos;s FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, and Dan Clark Audio&apos;s Aeon X. The DAC did an outstanding job with every device, and as I said at the start, I don&apos;t see the need to justify paying a premium for the K9 Pro any longer.</p>
<p>Fiio DACs usually deliver a clean sound without any coloration, and the K9 is no different. Like all great DACs, it just gets out of the way, and allows audio devices to shine; using the MM-500 with the K9 was just as enjoyable as with the K9 Pro. Yes, the K9 Pro delivers a better low-end when testing with the same headsets, and it has cleaner mid-range and elevated highs. That said, the differences are barely noticeable, and in all honesty, the K9 does just as good a job in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5" name="fiio-k9-19.jpg" alt="Fiio K9 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EwMJP2JMW7ot4ELoM54Qi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the K9 stands out is by pitting it against the K7; in this situation, the differences are easily noticeable. The K9 delivers a much better soundstage and dynamics, and you can immediately notice the difference in tonality between the two DACs â the K9 is just able to deliver a vibrant sound that you don&apos;t get with the K7.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the K9 offers the best value in Fiio&apos;s extensive DAC catalog. It has most of the features that made the K9 Pro an outstanding choice, and the best part is that it costs just $499. That&apos;s quite the bargain considering just what you&apos;re getting with this DAC.</p>
