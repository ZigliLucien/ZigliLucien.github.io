                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Let me just start off by saying this: the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is my new favorite phone. That may not be too surprising since I spent so much time over the past year gushing over the Razr Plus 2023, but there were some pretty glaring issues with last year&apos;s model that I was willing to ignore because I enjoyed the overall experience. This year, that&apos;s no longer the case.</p><p>Motorola seemed to address just about everything that I didn&apos;t like about last year&apos;s Razr Plus while adding some upgrades I didn&apos;t expect. The result is a phone that is exactly what I wish we got last year and what I believe sets a new standard for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Razr Plus 2024</a> has its quirks. But Samsung should really be taking notes for the Galaxy Z Flip lineup because Motorola is really doing something special with its 2024 Razr lineup.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-launch">announced</a> on June 25, 2024. The phone is available for preorder starting July 10, retailing for $999, and it will go on sale starting July 24, where it can be purchased unlocked at Motorola.com, Best Buy, and Amazon. It will also be available at T-Mobile, Consumer Cellular, and Xfinity Mobile.</p><p>On July 25, the phone will be available at the following carriers: Cricket, Spectrum Mobile, Straight Talk, Total by Verizon, Visible, Google Fi Wireless, Optimum Mobile, and UScellular. Boost Mobile customers will be able to purchase the phone later this summer.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 is available in one configuration and offered in four color options: Midnight Blue, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, and Hot Pink. Color options will vary depending on the carrier.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re familiar with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023, then the 2024 should look quite familiar. The design is largely the same, which is to be expected with a yearly upgrade, but there are some notable changes worth pointing out. On the front, the biggest difference is the larger cover screen, which takes up the entire front panel and rids the aluminum bar that connects to the frame. This means the only hints of color you get when looking at the phone straight on are the hinge and a bit of the frame.</p><p>Talking about the frame, it retains its glossy, rounded design, seamlessly blending into the front and back panels. However, this year, Motorola went with <del>faux</del> vegan leather for all colors, meaning you&apos;ll only find glass on the front. I really like this, as it means there&apos;s less worry when dropping the phone, although I&apos;d still recommend a case, especially a screen protector for the cover display.</p><p>I have the Spring Green colorway, but the phone also comes in Midnight Blue, Hot Pink, and Peach Fuzz. What I like about the green color option is that not only does it look good, but the material feels quite different from the other colors. It almost resembles grass in both look and feel, which makes sense given the name of the color. I honestly find this to be quite a nice touch.</p>

<p>Motorola seems to have improved the hinge this year. It&apos;s smaller when compared to the Razr Plus 2023, but it feels much sturdier when compared to last year&apos;s fairly wobbly hinge. With the Razr Plus 2024, opening the phone also feels much more satisfying and intentional, and closing it produces a much hardier sound. The hinge isn&apos;t as stiff as that of the Galaxy Z Flip 5, which I kind of prefer, as Samsung&apos;s phone often takes a bit more effort to open.</p><p>Motorola also tweaked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-waterproof">water resistance on the Razr Plus 2024</a>, giving it an IPX8 rating. This means you can submerge the phone completely, and it should survive, at least up to a point. Living in Seattle, where it&apos;s often wet and there are lakes everywhere, this is a great addition. It does come at the expense of dustproofing, but Motorola says this level of water resistance inherently includes protection against dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KrYVmGmoLkmnXejc4GWS8h" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-04.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 open at an angle with a video playing and the Android Bot placed on it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KrYVmGmoLkmnXejc4GWS8h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The internal display is the same 6.9-inch OLED panel, but there have been some improvements made. The crease looks and feels even less noticeable than on the Razr Plus 2023, which is saying something. The built-in screen protector also now covers more of the display, including the front-facing camera, resulting in a much more seamless-looking display.</p><p>The improvements continue once you turn the display on. Still the same 165Hz refresh rate as before, but Motorola increased the brightness by quite a bit, reaching a peak of 3000 nits. The color reproduction also appears to be much better, and the phone now gives you three display options, so you can choose between Natural, the newly added Radiant, and Vivid. I tend to keep phones on Natural because Vivid is often too... vivid. However, Radiant is a nice addition as it&apos;s a good medium between the two, so I keep the Razr Plus 2024 on this setting.</p><p>Motorola also includes flicker protection, which you might appreciate if you suffer from PWM sensitivity. I do miss the peek display feature found on previous Motorola phones, which was a clever way to utilize the AOD, but there are other sleep options that kind of make up for it, which I&apos;ll talk about later.</p>

<p>Last year&apos;s model was a bit behind with its chipset, using a slightly older Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1. This year, Motorola is using an up-to-date flagship chip with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, although it&apos;s still a slight downgrade compared to the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. You wouldn&apos;t really know it in regular use, however, as the phone performs spectacularly. Apps open quickly, I don&apos;t notice the usual lag when recording video, and the phone seems to be able to handle background apps much better, likely thanks to the 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Games like Honkai: Star Rail and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis default to high or ultra settings, and they load fast with virtually no gameplay issues. Honkai can even handle the highest settings at 60fps, and gameplay is smooth.</p>

<p>The audio situation isn&apos;t bad, but it could be better. The phone features dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and support for spatial sound. The speakers sound fine, although they&apos;re a bit hollow when playing music. I&apos;m no audiophile, but the audio isn&apos;t as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, which sounds very deep.</p><p>You also won&apos;t be blown away by the phone&apos;s haptics, but I&apos;m happy to say they&apos;re at least much better than Motorola&apos;s lower-end phones.</p><p>You&apos;ll find Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and sub-6 5G. There&apos;s no mmWave (sorry, Verizon subscribers), which is likely so Motorola can keep costs down. There&apos;s also no UWB, which is an odd choice given the simultaneous launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">Moto Tag</a>, which utilizes the tech to locate your items with phones that support it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MCEVZ7aREUpse6VUTeP8pX" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-14.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCEVZ7aREUpse6VUTeP8pX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My favorite thing about the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is the cover screen, and it&apos;s how I interact with the phone most of the time. It&apos;s now a larger 4-inch OLED panel with a high pixel density and 165Hz refresh rate. Is that overkill? Perhaps. My main complaint last year was that 144Hz on a 3.6-inch OLED wasn&apos;t doing much to help the abysmal battery life situation. That said, Motorola opted for an LTPO panel on the Razr Plus 2024, which means the display will dynamically adjust the refresh rate based on what&apos;s being displayed.</p><p>This should help improve the battery consumption from the cover screen, although I would like it if Motorola would let me adjust the cover screen refresh rate on its own from the main display. Still, the display is a massive improvement over the Razr Plus 2023, with a peak brightness of 2400 nits, so it&apos;s much more visible outside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJqycvUH5dTgkNg98H4vig" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-11.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen widget panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJqycvUH5dTgkNg98H4vig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola also tweaked the software on the cover screen, so it&apos;s much more useful. For instance, you can now set app shortcuts on the home screen. There&apos;s also a new widget panel to put your favorite widgets in one space.</p><p>Meanwhile, other panels have been revamped with better visuals, and there are even new animations. Motorola even added a new pinching gesture that lets you see all your panels at once, something that was shamelessly borrowed from Samsung.</p>

<p>Regardless, the new UI looks and feels a lot better and much more thought out. Little quality-of-life updates add to the experience, like now being able to enter a full-screen text mode when typing so that you can actually <em>see</em> what you&apos;re typing, something that was often an issue with the previous Razr Plus. Google services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> can now be viewed in full screen, and you now have access to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> from the cover screen. There are also new music player skins, which I think is a very nice touch.</p>

<p>I will say that setting up the cover screen can be a bit of a hassle because it feels like you have to set up the Razr Plus 2024 twice. You select which panels you want, which apps you want to access from the Apps panel, and which contacts you want to add... it&apos;s a lot. But once it&apos;s all set up, using the cover screen is quite fun and fairly easy to get the hang of, especially when transitioning apps from the main screen to the cover screen and vice versa.</p><p>The added screen real estate gives apps more space to shine, although vertical videos will still often be cropped down, meaning you&apos;ll have to open the phone to get the full picture. I also find that some apps like Instagram won&apos;t hold your place in the feed when you move from the cover screen to the main display, which can be annoying.</p><p>When you&apos;re not using the phone, Motorola has added two new idle modes: Sleep display and Desk display. The Sleep display is where you&apos;ll find the new AOD, which lets you view the time, notifications, and other info while the phone is locked. You can also wake the display just by bringing your hand up to the cover screen without touching it, or you can nudge the phone to wake it up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mJwgCRZeUoecu7rftmd773" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-15.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 Desk Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJwgCRZeUoecu7rftmd773.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Desk display, when the phone is open at an angle or set up like a tent, the display will act as a screensaver of sorts. It will display a carousel of images, notification icons, battery level, time, and more, and you can use preset images or add your own to the carousel. It&apos;s not a terribly useful feature, but it&apos;s a nice addition nonetheless, and I like that Motorola is looking for ways to take advantage of the flip phone form factor.</p>

<p>Software on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has been a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, I like the new Hello UX, as it feels like a welcome departure from the stock Android experience that Motorola has largely stuck with until now. It&apos;s not a huge overhaul, but there are some new UI aspects like the new Control Panel and Settings menu that are clearly different, and while some may be borrowed from other OEMs, I like the changes.</p><p>That said, Hello UX — which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> — should feel familiar for the most part, aside from the revamped Control Panel (you can always switch back to the stock quick settings/notification experience, as this is the default).</p><p>While I like the changes Motorola has made, there are moments when the software would freeze on me when switching from the main display to the cover screen, and both displays would appear black for a little bit before returning to normal. It happens every now and then, but not enough to really annoy me since it fixes itself fairly quickly. There are some other small software issues I&apos;ve come across while using it, but I imagine these things can be fixed easily with an update. Still, it would be nice if it were a bit more polished.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Motorola retained its most useful features, like gestures to turn on the camera or flashlight and the side panel for opening your most used apps. The Razr Plus 2024 also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>, which works like a charm on my ASUS laptop and can be used to drag and drop content across devices, control multiple devices with one mouse and keyboard, or use a laptop or external display as a mobile desktop.</p><p>One new addition to the mix is Moto AI, which is being sprinkled throughout the software. Right now, you&apos;ll find it in a few experiences, such as the camera. For instance, with Style Sync, you can take or upload a photo, and the phone will create a wallpaper based on the image. The idea is to snap a photo of your current outfit so your phone can match.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Magic Canvas. It&apos;s an interesting take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-create-generative-ai-wallpapers-android-14">AI Wallpaper</a> feature that you&apos;ll find on devices like the Pixel or some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> with Android 14. Essentially, you type a prompt, and the phone will generate what you wrote. It&apos;s a fun feature, although the results are a bit too artsy for my liking. And while I previously found Samsung and Google&apos;s method of having users insert preselected words within prewritten prompts a bit limiting, I can&apos;t help but wish Motorola had gone with that instead of trying to create its own wallpaper feature from scratch.</p>

<p>Tragically, some of the more interesting Moto AI features are not yet available on the Razr Plus 2024, although they are expected to arrive soon. One feature takes your notifications and summarizes the most important information to catch you up on ongoing conversations you may have missed. There&apos;s also a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-recall-faq-everything-you-need-to-know">Recall</a>-like feature that remembers certain details for you based on your interactions by taking and saving snapshots (on-device) or by you telling Moto AI to "pay attention" so that it records and summarizes conversations for you.</p><p>Motorola says these features will arrive "in the coming months," but it would be nice if they were available at launch, as some of them seem legitimately interesting. But for now, new Razr Plus 2024 owners will just have to settle for three months of free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Moto AI sounds like Motorola's answer to Gemini and Galaxy AI, but many features aren't here or feel half-baked.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">software promise for the Razr Plus 2024</a> hasn&apos;t changed, and the company will provide three OS upgrades and four years of software updates for the device.

That said, Motorola doesn&apos;t have a great track record with software updates, and while the Razr Plus 2023 received regular bi-monthly updates, it only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">just started receiving Android 14</a> in the first week of July, nine months after it started rolling out on other devices.</p>

<p>I&apos;m happy to say that the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 has improved a lot in the imaging department. The 50MP primary sensor is a major step up from the 12MP sensor on last year&apos;s model, and Motorola&apos;s new AI-powered image engine proves to be quite capable.</p><p>Images from the Razr Plus 2024 are crisp and detailed, with a good amount of contrast and saturation without going overboard. It&apos;s almost a stark contrast to last year&apos;s Razr, which often produced flat and lifeless images, even if it leaned on truer-to-life color reproduction.</p><p>White balance is also much improved and the phone seems comfortable in most lighting conditions. Low-light and nighttime images aren&apos;t particularly strong, and you&apos;ll find some hits and misses, but I was able to capture some decent images of fireworks on the 4th of July. </p>

<p>There&apos;s no ultrawide camera, which might deter some of you, but I actually don&apos;t mind that Motorola switched it out for a 2x telephoto lens. The 50MP sensor actually produces images that are just as good as the primary camera and lets the phone retain a surprising amount of detail even at 8x zoom. Both lenses also have good natural bokeh, although it&apos;s slightly better with the portrait mode, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>As usual with the Razr Plus, you can use the cover screen to offer a preview of the image before you take it, which helps your subject position themselves. And of course, Motorola has also included some unique features with the camera like Adaptive Stabilization, which helps keep the video stable during intense movement, giving you an almost action-cam-like experience. There&apos;s also an easily accessible Action Cam button, which helps you capture fast-moving subjects and keep them in focus.</p><p>Another way Motorola is taking advantage of the flip phone form factor is with Auto Camcorder, which automatically starts recording as soon as you fold the phone 90-degrees, like an old-school camcorder. This mode also turns the bottom half into a touch pad of sorts, so you can use your thumb to easily zoom in and out while recording.</p>

<p>Battery life was a weak point of last year&apos;s Razr, but I&apos;m happy to report that I&apos;m actually quite pleased with the Razr Plus 2024 battery life. While the 2023 model could barely get me through half a day, the Razr Plus 2024 gets me through a good portion of the day—at least to the end of my work day after waking up at around 6 a.m.—on a single charge. You might be able to squeeze out a full day, depending on your use, but I&apos;m admittedly a pretty heavy user. Still, it&apos;s nice to no longer have battery anxiety if I decide to leave my home with a 50% charge.</p><p>Meanwhile, charging speeds have also improved, thanks to 45W wired and 15W wireless charging support. You&apos;ll need your own 45W or higher charging adapter, but I&apos;d suggest springing for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-100w-chargers">100W charger</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the closest competitor to the Razr Plus 2024 is the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. The phone features last year&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and a fairly large 3.4-inch cover screen. Camera quality is pretty good, and Samsung excels with software support, although the cover screen functionality is fairly limited compared to the Razr. The phone will also become old news once the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is launched, which will likely happen on July 10 during Galaxy Unpacked 2024.</p><p>Honor recently revealed its first flip phone, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch">Honor Magic V Flip</a>, which also features a 4-inch cover screen. The unique software saves a small section of the cover screen for the time and notifications, while the remaining presents a vertical app display that supports more than 40 apps. Yet, while there are some impressive specs, the phone is powered by a much older Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 and is only available in China.</p><p>If you want to go cheaper, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> is a low-cost flip phone with a great design, a decent 50MP camera, and good performance. Of course, you miss out on the app experience with its smaller cover screen, the software isn&apos;t great, and there&apos;s no IP protection.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are looking for a modern flip-style phone.</li><li>You want a phone with a good camera.</li><li>You own last year's Razr Plus... it's really so much better.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want reliable software support and fast OS upgrades.</li><li>You prefer to have an ultrawide camera over a telephoto sensor.</li></ul>
<p>To say that I&apos;m impressed with the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is a bit of an understatement. Motorola actually listened and addressed the biggest shortcomings of last year&apos;s model, giving us better battery life, better cameras, better hardware, and even a better cover screen experience. The 2023 model already seemed ahead in many ways, setting a standard for the flip phone category that was once established by Samsung. Now, Motorola is using the Razr Plus 2024 to solidify itself in the foldable space with a flip phone that&apos;s almost perfect.</p><p>Of course, no phone is perfect, and the Razr Plus 2024 may not be enticing to everyone, especially after swapping the ultrawide camera for a telephoto lens. However, if that doesn&apos;t bother you, I feel like many of my biggest gripes can (and likely will) be addressed with some software updates.</p><p>Even with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 right behind it, I have a feeling the Razr Plus 2024 will be the best flip phone of the year.</p>

<p>The number of Wear OS smartwatches has dwindled in recent years, even with Google re-focusing its efforts on the platform. We&apos;re now almost two years removed from the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a>, which was replaced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> in late 2023.</p><p>While other companies have exited the wearable race, Mobvoi seems determined to stick around. In early 2024, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> was released, offering some reprieve for those wanting a smartwatch from a company other than Google or Samsung.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-watch-2-vs-mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-design-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 2 vs. Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro: Design and specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QegdLVf5mDVsZkeK2q2oXN" name="google-pixel-watch-2-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QegdLVf5mDVsZkeK2q2oXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s immediately apparent when comparing the Pixel Watch 2 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro that these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> are focused on different segments of the market. Google takes a more elegant approach with its polished aluminum frame that looks good on just about every wrist.</p><p>Google opted to stick with the same design as the original Pixel Watch, meaning that we have the same 1.2-inch AMOLED screen on the Pixel Watch 2. On the right side, you&apos;ll still find the same rotating crown for navigation, along with a button above it to invoke <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Assistant</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.)</p><p>Like its predecessor, the Pixel Watch 2 also relies on a proprietary band mechanism, which isn&apos;t a huge problem now. Not only are there more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-2-bands">compatible bands</a> to be found from third parties, but you can even get an adapter to make quick-release bands work. </p><p>Under the hood, both the Pixel Watch 2 and TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1</a> chip from Qualcomm. Additionally, these smartwatches pair the W5 SoC with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. But that&apos;s pretty much where the similarities come to an end. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3281px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="F6C2nwA7DGLpsCDHvWgpTS" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-hero-16x9.jpeg" alt="TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro review hero 16x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6C2nwA7DGLpsCDHvWgpTS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3281" height="1846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite sharing the same processor, RAM, and storage as the Pixel Watch 2, there are a couple of clear advantages of the Pro 5 Enduro. The first of which is the larger 1.43-inch AMOLED display. This just makes reading notifications and interacting with your smartwatch much easier.</p><p>The Pro 5 Enduro has another trick up its sleeve, as there are actually two displays. For years, Mobvoi has implemented a secondary Ultra Low-Power display into its top-end smartwatches. This technology returns with the Pro 5 series and in a big way. </p>

<p>Not only does this secondary screen make it so you can quickly check the time without illuminating the AMOLED panel. But, it&apos;s also been updated so that you can track workouts from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-apps-android">popular apps</a>, such as Nike Run Club, Strava, and others.</p><p>Speaking of workouts, the Pro 5 Enduro has been updated with a new Sapphire Crystal Glass. This aims to ensure some peace of mind whether you&apos;re going out for a run or climbing the side of a mountain. </p><p>Another change that Mobvoi made is that you can now scroll through messages and menus using the rotating crown.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU" name="ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-oneplus-open-mobvoi-health.jpeg" alt="Mobvoi Health on the OnePlus Open and TicWatch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pS3aGG3vpRrvQ7vr3NQhU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don&apos;t care that much about the difference in size, then you might care a bit more about battery life. This is where the Pro 5 Enduro blows the Pixel Watch 2, and pretty much every other smartwatch, out of the water. </p><p>Thanks to the combination of the AMOLED panel and the Ultra Low-Power display, the Pro 5 Enduro is rated for up to 90 hours on a single charge. While the Pixel Watch 2 and its 24 hours of battery life are an improvement over the original Pixel Watch, it still pales in comparison to the TicWatch.</p><p>Perhaps the best part is that when the Enduro has run out of juice, it&apos;s not rendered useless. Instead, the ULP kicks into gear, still showing you the time, date, and a few health metrics. It&apos;s this level of ingenuity that helps Mobvoi stand out from the crowd, even if it doesn&apos;t dominate headlines like Google or Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ch8r3LoourTAwtrbmfTrsm" name="google-pixel-watch-2-review-13.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ch8r3LoourTAwtrbmfTrsm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software, however, is another story. As you&apos;d expect, the Pixel Watch 2 runs Wear OS 4 out of the box, which continues to see regular updates and offers a "stock" experience. Unfortunately, despite the Pro 5 Enduro being released more than seven months after the release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>, it&apos;s still running Wear OS 3.5. </p><p>Mobvoi is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-wear-os-4-beta-recruitment-opens">reportedly</a> working on an update to Wear OS 4, but that has still yet to see the light of day outside of a closed beta program. While there aren&apos;t very many changes on the surface, it doesn&apos;t leave us feeling great about future OS compatibility. Not to mention that you can&apos;t currently use Google Assistant, or Gemini, with the TicWatch Pro 5 or Pro 5 Enduro. </p><p>On the bright side, the overall interface is essentially identical between the Pixel Watch 2 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro. The only major difference is in the health tracking apps and available watch faces for each wearable. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-fitbit-workout-ui-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTjV2AijgSRpbXZRSUnoQ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, the Pixel Watch 2 and Pro 5 Enduro share the same set of health and fitness tracking sensors. This includes the obvious things like SpO2, skin temperature, heart rate, gyroscope, and more. <br></p><p>However, the Pixel Watch 2 adds both a cEDA sensor and an ECG sensor. The former is used to keep track of your stress levels, while the latter keeps an eye on your heart rhythm. Both of these have become staples of modern smartwatches, so it&apos;s disappointing that Mobvoi opted against including them with the Pro 5 Enduro.</p><p>When it comes to keeping track of your metrics, the Pixel Watch 2 primarily relies on the Fitbit app. At the same time, the Pro 5 Enduro utilizes a suite of apps from Mobvoi, all of which record and compile the data into the accompanying phone app. For the most part, this isn&apos;t a big deal, as you can still download many of your favorite apps from the Play Store. </p>

<p>Potentially making the decision a bit more difficult is that both the Pixel Watch 2 vs. TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro are priced at $350. So it&apos;s not like either gains an advantage on that front. The only difference is that you can get the Pixel Watch 2 with LTE for $50 more, whereas the TicWatch is Wi-Fi only.</p><p>What it all boils down to is whether you prefer the Pixel Watch 2 with its better software update support, smaller design, and are okay with charging every night. If battery life and a bigger screen are worth the compromise to software updates, then the TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is the one for you. </p>

<ul><li>CMF by Nothing, a sub-brand of tech startup Nothing, has been hyping up the release of the CMF Phone 1 for months.</li><li>The phone officially launched today, offering customizable backplates with support for accessories, and is priced at $199.</li><li>It’s a neat device, but Nothing‘s Beta Program is a lackluster way to get around making the company’s phones fully-available in the U.S. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing, the tech startup built by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei and comprised of many former OnePlus employees, is all about hype — and it&apos;s not hard to see why. The smartphone industry has been boring for a long time, and even new form factors like folding phones haven&apos;t shaken things up enough. Nothing and its sub-brand CMF by Nothing — which stands for color, materials, finish — wants to bring back character in tech. </p><p>It&apos;s doing that with CMF Phone 1, a device that was teased for months prior to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-cmf-phone-1-is-a-customizable-budget-phone-starting-at-dollar199">its official launch on Monday, July 8</a>. The cryptic teasers for the device showed off a large knob that was eventually revealed to be a screw. Later, Nothing revealed that the CMF Phone 1 features many exposed screws. That led some fans to speculate that the CMF Phone 1 might have a removable battery or a repair-friendly design in general, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">Fairphone 5</a>. </p><p>To put it simply, that was never going to happen. It&apos;s expensive to design a phone that has modern features and old-school repairability in mind. That&apos;s why the Fairphone 5 costs over $700 (though it isn&apos;t available in the U.S.), and Framework laptops aren&apos;t any cheaper than their competitors. CMF is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">a budget brand</a>, and it&apos;s virtually impossible to design a device like a Fairphone or Framework laptop on a budget.</p><p>So, what did Nothing give us with that giant screw? It&apos;s all about customization. There are different-colored backplates that can be swapped in or out as you please. You can screw in a stand, card case, or lanyard loop into the back of the phone. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r86E4P42hX47mhyCunjs67" name="CMF-Phone-1-Accessories.jpg" alt="The accessories for the CMF Phone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r86E4P42hX47mhyCunjs67.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s almost like having MagSafe or Qi2, except instead of magnets, the CMF Phone 1 uses real screws. There are real advantages to this method of attaching accessories. People who like industrial design will appreciate the look of the CMF Phone 1 more, and it also means the accessories won&apos;t go anywhere.</p><p>If you kept your expectations in check — and didn&apos;t dream of a removable battery or an upgradable phone for $200 (which would be cool, by the way) — then the CMF Phone 1 lives up to the hype. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5689px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dg8eJJs657Zvv9Fposh6B4" name="CMF-Phone-1-official.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 screen and back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dg8eJJs657Zvv9Fposh6B4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5689" height="3200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even if you think the customization and design features are a gimmick, there is still a lot under-the-hood for $200. The display looks to be one of the more impressive parts of the CMF Phone 1, since it sports a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with support for 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, and a 2000-nit brightness. It also has a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 5,000 mAh battery. To get all that for $199 feels like a true bargain. </p><p>However, there&apos;s a catch. The CMF Phone 1 lives up to the hype, as long as you don&apos;t live in North America. While it seems to be a stellar option in other parts of the world — like India, where it starts at  ₹15,999 for a 6GB RAM model — it&apos;s just not a good one in the U.S., and it&apos;s not even available in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-cmf-phone-1-2">The problem with the CMF Phone 1</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb" name="CMF-Phone-1-NothingOS.jpg" alt="CMF Phone 1 Nothing OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KxvfreeB8LSWhf4udDPdb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7111" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem with the CMF Phone 1 is that Nothing isn&apos;t making it for the U.S., but it&apos;s still selling it here. To be clear, I&apos;d have no problem if the CMF Phone 1 were only sold in regions other than North America. There are plenty of things that are available in the U.S. and not elsewhere, so it&apos;d be nice for Europe and Asia to get their own exclusives for a change. However, it&apos;s not cool that Nothing wants to <em>kind of</em> sell the CMF Phone 1 and other products in the U.S. Either go all in, or all out. </p><p>Nothing skirts full U.S. sales by selling products like the CMF Phone 1 as part of the "Beta Program." When you buy the CMF Phone 1, you&apos;re really buying access to the Beta Program, and you get the CMF Phone 1 for free as a result. It&apos;s the lazy way of bringing a phone to the country without doing the work required to sell a phone in the U.S. normally. </p><p>I take exception to the fact that the CMF Phone 1 is sold in the U.S. at all, because it&apos;s a bad phone in this country. It barely supports any of the major cellular carriers due to its old and, frankly, bad modem. It doesn&apos;t support 5G on AT&T, nor does it support VoLTE and VoWiFi. Verizon isn&apos;t recommended to be used with this phone at all, and only T-Mobile works with <em>some</em> 5G bands. None of the three major U.S. cellular carriers are fully featured on CMF Phone 1.</p><p>Nobody wants to think about whether the phone they&apos;re buying has the right cellular bands to work with the major networks. But they&apos;re important, and they could determine whether your phone works or it doesn&apos;t. Nothing, by selling this phone as part of the "Beta Program," is trying to shift the responsibility on the user to know what they&apos;re getting into before they buy CMF Phone 1. </p><p>I want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nothing-cmf-buds-pro-2-announced">more Nothing products</a> to be available in the U.S., but it has to be done the right way. After an unrelenting hype cycle, the CMF Phone 1 lives up to the excitement, as long as you&apos;re in the right region. Unfortunately, North America isn&apos;t one of the right regions.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Galaxy AI's Live Translate feature is rumored to extend to third-party apps, starting with WhatsApp.</li><li>Samsung previously confirmed plans to expand Live Translate beyond its native apps, though it did not mention the specific third-party apps included.</li><li>On Samsung devices, Live Translate works in default messaging and phone calls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> Live Translate, which gives you real-time language translations, is rumored to soon extend to third-party apps, with WhatsApp tipped to be one of the first to pick it up.</p><p>At last year&apos;s launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series, Samsung introduced a bunch of AI features aimed at taking the smartphone experience to the next level. One standout was Live Translate, which allows for real-time communication across different languages. Initially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-galaxy-s24-live-translate">Live Translate only worked within Samsung&apos;s own apps and devices</a>. But there have been plans to extend this support to third-party apps.</p><p>Now, reliable leaker Ice Universe says on X (formerly Twitter) that WhatsApp integration is in the works (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-ai-live-translate-whatsapp-calls/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). However, there&apos;s no word, official or otherwise, on when this feature will be available.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy AI will power WhatsApp real-time translation<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1809464026830893439">July 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Although Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-ai-experience-optimized-upcoming-foldable-teased">previously confirmed that it&apos;s expanding Live Translate to third-party apps</a>, the company has not officially announced which apps will be included.</p><p>How Live Translate will work in third-party apps is still a bit of a mystery. On compatible Samsung devices, though, it already integrates with the default messaging app and even offers real-time translation during phone calls.</p><p>Since Live Translate already works for calls and messages in the native app, it is a safe bet that the same functionality is coming to WhatsApp. This would make cross-language communication much smoother on Meta&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging platform</a>.</p><p>With a compatible device, this feature translates your voice into the preferred language of the person you&apos;re talking to and vice versa. You can also see live transcriptions of the conversation on your screen. The best part is that all of this happens in real-time, making communication seamless.</p><p>Furthermore, Samsung&apos;s possible expansion of Live Translate beyond WhatsApp hints at a major shift in cross-platform communication. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-ai-live-translate-third-party-calling-apps/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> speculates that other popular apps like Google Meet, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and Signal might soon adopt this Galaxy AI-powered feature as well.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Micron is one of the largest manufacturers of DRAM and storage modules in the world, and it sells its products to customers under the Crucial brand. The brand focuses on RAM and internal NVMe SSDs, but it also has a decent selection of external SSDs, and the X9 Pro continues to be among its best offerings.</p><p>The X9 Pro is available in storage configurations starting at 1TB and going up to 4TB. The 1TB model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-1TB-Portable-CT1000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0C9WKGXHD">retails for $97 on Amazon</a>, the 2TB version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-1TB-Portable-CT1000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0C9WHSZZN?th=1">costs $179</a>, and the 4TB edition is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Pro-1TB-Portable-CT1000X9PROSSD902/dp/B0C9WGQY8G">available for $269</a>. The pricing is identical to what Samsung charges for the T7 SSD if you&apos;re getting the 1TB model, but there are decent savings to be had with the X9 Pro if you want the 2TB or 4TB models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sDXwJZcoKXWG6jKjm4fMFf" name="crucial-x9-pro-7.jpg" alt="Crucial X9 Pro in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sDXwJZcoKXWG6jKjm4fMFf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn&apos;t much to differentiate the drive in terms of design; the X9 Pro has an aluminum chassis that&apos;s built to last, and it has rounded edges and a rubberized back. What I like about the drive is its size; it is one of the smallest external drives you can buy today, and it is inherently portable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="akXYYbrFBaSfBH8PatgFpe" name="crucial-x9-pro-8.jpg" alt="Crucial X9 Pro plugged into Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akXYYbrFBaSfBH8PatgFpe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You don&apos;t get much in the way of accessories other than a USB-C to USB-C cable, and there&apos;s a tiny LED indicator that lights up when the X9 Pro is in use. The drive gets IP55 dust and water resistance, and that&apos;s enough to safeguard the device against the occasional spill of water.</p>

<p>In six months of regular use, I didn&apos;t see any issues whatsoever with the build quality or design, and the X9 Pro has been flawless in this regard. A key advantage with an SSD over a mechanical drive is the fast transfers; the X9 Pro is able to hit reads of 1,050MB/s and writes of 900MB/s, and it came close to those figures in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iuL8oZXbdGoKgASJZaRgnf" name="crucial-x9-pro-9.jpg" alt="Crucial X9 Pro connected to Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuL8oZXbdGoKgASJZaRgnf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I connected the drive to my Windows machine at times, but an overwhelming majority of the usage was on Android; I transferred thousands of photos and videos from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-13-ultra-global-review">Xiaomi 13 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> to the drive, and while it had a few connection issues in the beginning, an update solved that problem.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GbKTcdHXwTxcJQA2tFZuTf" name="crucial-x9-pro-6.jpg" alt="Crucial X9 Pro in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbKTcdHXwTxcJQA2tFZuTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Transfers involving photos in general took a lot longer than videos, and that&apos;s true of all drives — you see a noticeable decline in performance once a drive&apos;s cache is full. That said, the X9 Pro was reliable throughout, and that&apos;s what the biggest consideration in an external SSD.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2CvNAvWAszoW9F7HX7ckeg" name="crucial-x9-pro-1.jpg" alt="Crucial X9 Pro against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CvNAvWAszoW9F7HX7ckeg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive isn&apos;t without fault; the X9 Pro still doesn&apos;t have password protection, so you can&apos;t lock the drive easily. Crucial said it would add it in an update back when the SSD launched in Q3 2023, but as of July 2024, that hasn&apos;t materialized. So if this is a feature you need, you should just get the Samsung T7 instead — Samsung makes it effortlessly easy to lock data behind a password.</p><p>Outside of that, there are no issues with the X9 Pro. The external SSD is reliable, has a rugged design that&apos;s built to last, and is small enough that you can easily carry it anywhere. It is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-drive-your-chromebox">best external SSDs</a> if you need a fast drive with plenty of storage, and the 2TB and 4TB models are a great value.</p>

However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> have become much more competitive as companies flock to launch their own versions of the lower-cost foldable phones. So, how has the Galaxy Z Flip 5 fared over the past year since its launch?</p><p>Complicating that answer is the very imminent launch of the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which we expect will gain a number of welcome upgrades over the Flip 5. But even so, it&apos;s always worth considering the previous generation to either save money on an already great phone or discern how a company may treat the newest mode. So, in the spirit of potentially saving some money, let&apos;s look at how my statements from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5 review</a> have held up and whether or not it&apos;s still worth buying today.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nY84QbFvc3B766MrZFDyvP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going-1.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 near a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nY84QbFvc3B766MrZFDyvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"Despite the same boxy design, the Z Flip 5 does have one benefit over its predecessors; a new hinge. Thanks to Samsung finally adopting a waterdrop-style hinge design that other OEMs have long used, the company is finally able to make the Z Flip 5 close more or less completely flat and without an unsightly gap."</strong></em></p>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing Samsung is good at, it&apos;s hardware. The company has sold many foldables over the years and has nearly perfected the hardware portion. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 may not look all that different from its predecessors, but it&apos;s a solid design that has held up well over the past year, especially now that the phone closes completely shut. The water resistance is also a nice touch, especially in the often wet and sometimes rainy Seattle weather.</p><p>I&apos;m not too fond of the fact that the cameras tend to gather dust around them, but that&apos;s a given with this kind of design. The glossy frame and glass back also get a bit smudgy, but I tend to keep a case on it. And if you&apos;re looking for a Galaxy Z Flip 5 case, I would suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/collections/galaxy-z-flip-5-case-thin">this one from Thinborne</a>, which is not only incredibly thin and tough but also adds a magnet ring for MagSafe accessories. And while you&apos;re at it, go and grab this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B79ZKDPQ/">Lamicall Magnetic Phone Ring Holder</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4181px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zU6CJQPhfBa8wMm2ZA3FZM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going-5.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 with a Thinborne case and MagSafe ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zU6CJQPhfBa8wMm2ZA3FZM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4181" height="2352" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"With the new hinge design, I expected the display to feature a rather minimal crease. Unfortunately, that&apos;s not really the case. The crease is very much present, both physically and visually, and to a level that surprises me quite a bit."</strong></em></p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 hinge is still as sturdy as it was when it first launched, which is more than I can say for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, which had a somewhat flimsy hinge. The Flip is able to retain its position from various angles, which is nice when taking photos or watching content.</p><p>That said, the crease is still a problem. Coming from other foldables like the Razr Plus 2023 and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a>, the Z Flip 5 display is always so jarring because of the very deep and visually noticeable crease. It&apos;s my least favorite thing about the otherwise great AMOLED display.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Cover screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WCVzPqwLGXoK2UpFmFv77V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going-3.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 cover screen apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCVzPqwLGXoK2UpFmFv77V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"On the one hand, it&apos;s great that Samsung is finally giving us a larger and more functional external display, and there&apos;s a lot to like about it. However, as I previously pointed out, </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-screen-initial-impressions"><em><strong>the cover screen feels held back by Samsung&apos;s software</strong></em></a><em><strong>, and for absolutely no reason."</strong></em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Samsung seems to be pretty stubborn on this front. A year later, I continue to be at odds with the Galaxy Z Flip 5 cover screen. Samsung clearly put some thought into it, which is evident by the various panels and unique navigation options like pinching to view all the panels at once (something Motorola recently adopted). However, Samsung continues to hold back the cover screen experience with the odd decision to hide most apps behind a series of menus and the Good Lock app.</p><p>Not only that, but there are still plenty of actions that require you to open the phone, and multitasking is still nonexistent. I&apos;d say that Samsung has rendered the cover screen experience to nothing more than a blown-up smartwatch, but I often feel that even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch</a> can accomplish more than the cover screen.</p><p>I had a friend switch from an iPhone to the Galaxy Z Flip 5, and he had no idea he could use apps on the cover screen. I had to walk him through how to enable apps and then how to download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> to get other apps on his cover screen. He was quite surprised that he could do all of this with the cover screen. This tells me that Samsung is not only failing to really communicate the functionality of the cover screen, but it&apos;s making this whole experience unnecessarily complicated.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-software-and-performance-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Software and performance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p8c8LQvDRcS5aDFKd6FqKY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-how-it-started-how-its-going-6.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 advanced intelligence menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p8c8LQvDRcS5aDFKd6FqKY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"It&apos;s not perfect, and Samsung still bogs things down by pushing its own apps on you, but I feel that Google can learn a lot from One UI, particularly regarding foldables."</strong></em></p>
<p>Aside from the frustrating cover screen experience, Samsung&apos;s One UI continues to be my favorite flavor of Android. I find the software quite clean and not too flashy or cartoony, and the phone continues to perform as well as it did when I first used it, no doubt thanks to the impressive Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><p>A quick swipe down for the Quick Settings menu reveals <em>six</em> toggles, the brightness slider, and a shortcut to the settings app. I appreciate that it doesn&apos;t take a second swipe to get to most of these things, and when you do swipe again, you get 12 user-selected toggles, permanent Wi-Fi and Bluetooth buttons, additional display options, and more. It&apos;s just a great use of space.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 5 launched with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> but has since received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6">One UI 6</a> based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, giving it some welcome UI enhancements (including some I mentioned above for Quick Settings) and additional features. The phone also continues to receive monthly software updates, which is always nice.</p><p>Perhaps one of the biggest updates came in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> and brought some fun and useful new features to the Galaxy Z Flip 5. Of them, my favorites are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-chat-assist-samsung-galaxy-s24">Chat Assist</a>, which make it easy to search for anything on your screen and communicate with people in other languages, among other useful functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3855px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wZPsnBBRgFG9d7qHFmKL2c" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-gesture-navigation-bar.jpg" alt="The gesture navigation bar on the Galaxy Z Flip 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZPsnBBRgFG9d7qHFmKL2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3855" height="2169" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, my biggest gripe with One UI continues to be Samsung&apos;s continued use of a horizontal app drawer instead of a vertical one. It doesn&apos;t make sense to me and it sort of ruins the experience a bit. You could enable vertical scrolling with a Good Lock module, but the solution wasn&apos;t perfect and Samsung disabled it with Android 14 without warning. Fortunately, it looks set to return with an update later this year, but instead of making it a Good Lock option, Samsung needs to just make vertical scrolling the default.</p>
<p><em><strong>"Depending on your use, the 3700mAh battery can </strong></em><em><strong>maybe</strong></em><em><strong> get you through most of the day on a single charge, but I find that I can maybe get to the end of a work day before the Z Flip 5 is on its last legs."</strong></em></p>
<p>Despite updates and new features, the battery life situation remains roughly the same a year later. It&apos;s not phenomenal, but the Galaxy Z Flip 5 can get you through much of the day. Just be prepared to sit around and wait for the phone to charge with its meager 25W wired charging speed.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in Flex Mode with the camera on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3602" height="2026" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p><em><strong>"In my experience, the phone&apos;s cameras take perfectly adequate images with enough detail, color, and dynamic range that they&apos;ll require very little editing before throwing them up on Instagram."</strong></em></p>
<p>Not much has changed on this front. The camera still performs as well as it has, producing crisp images during the day and fairly detailed photos in low-light. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 continues to be a well-rounded camera phone that is enhanced by the form factor, which gives you different shooting options than you&apos;d find on a regular phone.</p><p>Propping up the top half lets you emulate a tripod with the cover screen previewing the photo in real time, letting your subject adjust their pose for the perfect shot.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-6-1-camera-features-past-gen-galaxy">One UI 6.1</a>, Samsung added new features to the Gallery, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>, which lets you erase or move things around while the app fills in the space. There&apos;s also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-instant-slow-mo-galaxy-ai-pure-magic">Instant Slow-Mo</a>, which slows down almost any video in your gallery, even if it wasn&apos;t shot in slow motion. The phone uses AI to intelligently fill in the extra frames, and the effect is pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-should-you-still-buy-it-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5: Should you still buy it?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3883px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kieckGt5dGPbAnp27hourn" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-review-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 outdoors with the cover screen on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kieckGt5dGPbAnp27hourn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3883" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> on the way, the Z Flip 5 is still a great phone that has plenty going for it. Sure you don&apos;t get the same seven years of software support like with Samsung&apos;s latest phones, and some generative AI features may be limited, but as far as flip phones go, this is one of the best. If anything, the launch of the Z Flip 6 will drive the price even lower, making this a steal.</p><p>If you&apos;re in the market for a flip phone, I would say that the Galaxy Z Flip 5 is still a good buy. Otherwise, you can spring for the latest model or you can look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-hands-on">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which hits stores soon.</p>

You&apos;ll also be eligible to receive up to <strong>$1,500 of trade-in credit</strong> once the devices go live on July 10th, plus you&apos;ll be entered into a sweepstakes to win $5,000. If predictions are correct, Samsung is expected to reveal the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 during the event, but this deal can be applied to any of the new devices. </p><p>There&apos;s no obligation to buy if you change your mind later, and you can always remove yourself from Samsung&apos;s email list if you&apos;re no longer interested after the event on July 10th. There&apos;s no such thing as free money, but with the Galaxy Reserve program, you&apos;re coming pretty darn close. </p>

<p>A bunch of new Samsung devices are set to be unveiled on July 10th, but if you reserve your place in line today, you'll receive an exclusive $50 credit. You'll also be eligible to receive up to $1,500 of trade-in credit once the mystery devices go live, <em>and </em>you'll be entered into a sweepstakes to win an additional $5,000 of Samsung credit. </p>
<p>There's no obligation to buy, no payment required today, and you only need to provide your name and email address. Just keep in mind that the offer expires once Samsung Unpacked starts on July 10th, so don't wait much longer!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://howl.link/d4ex1o8mjix8w " target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="78a37c78-9b80-4241-bf28-739453184fd4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more" data-dimension48="Reserve your Galaxy preorder and get $50 of credit, up to $1,500 of trade-in credit, and more">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>So what new devices do we expect to see during Samsung Unpacked on July 10th? Well, nothing has been confirmed, but a large number of leaks and rumors have suggested that we might get a first look at the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a> foldable phones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 series</a>, and, if we&apos;re lucky, the highly-anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>. </p><p>Filling out the form above will give you $50 to apply to any of the aforementioned Galaxy devices, assuming we&apos;re correct about the stuff that&apos;s revealed. You&apos;ll obviously lose the credit if you decide not to preorder after the event, but there&apos;s no real pressure from Samsung beyond that. </p>
<h2 id="when-is-samsung-unpacked-2">When is Samsung Unpacked?</h2>

<p>Most of the smart home devices currently on sale at Amazon support the Alexa platform, so if you use Google Home or any other personal assistant, you may want to wait until Prime Day to see what other offers will go live during the event. It&apos;s also worth noting that most of the following deals require a Prime membership, so if you haven&apos;t joined up yet, it may be a good time to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>signing up for the 30-day Amazon Prime free trial</strong></a> so you don&apos;t miss out on any of the action.  </p>

<hr>
<p>We&apos;re only a couple of days away from Unpacked, and the pricing of Samsung&apos;s next wave of earbuds has leaked.</p><p>The alleged pricing of the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were detailed by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Kuma_Sleepy/status/1809656482553868693">Kuma_Sleepy</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-3-pro-price-leaks-south-korea/">SamMobile</a>). From the screenshot, which is from a South Korean retailer, the base Buds 3 will seemingly hit the shelves at 203,700 KRW (~$147). The higher-end Pro variant features a 296,700 KRW (~$214) price tag.</p><p>With that, the early retail listing also gives one final look at the Galaxy Buds 3 series&apos; design changes we&apos;ve seen rumored quite often. While Samsung has moved away from the bulbous look of the Buds (along with that wingtip), the base model is devoid of a silicon ear tip.</p><p>Samsung seems poised to save that little addition for the Pro variant — and let&apos;s not forget about the new stem design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-pro-apple-like-redesign-leak">which feels like Apple&apos;s AirPods</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the publication notes that these assumed price points for the Galaxy Buds 3 series are close to the Buds 2 series. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a> launched at $229 in 2022, while the base version went for $149.</p><p>If these prices are the real deal, it could be good news for interested consumers. However, it&apos;s always worth remembering that price conversions aren&apos;t always 1:1, meaning Samsung will likely make pricing adjustments based on the region.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">정말 버즈 3, 버즈 3 프로가 이 가격에 나온다면 차라리 할인 할 때 까지 기다릴 듯 pic.twitter.com/UbNkWeAFvw<a href="https://twitter.com/Kuma_Sleepy/status/1809656482553868693">July 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With anticipation building, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro was recently spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-real-life-images-leak">a few real-life images</a> alongside the revamped case. Not only did the images confirm the existence of a new stem design for the Buds 3 series, but the charging case offers a metallic finish with a clear dome. The person who obtained the device and posted the pictures stated they were able to connect them to a Galaxy Z Flip 4 and an iPhone.</p><p>Other discoveries in the Samsung Members app suggested that the stem <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-3-stem-design-to-feature-pinch-controls">will offer playback controls</a>. The app&apos;s code showed that consumers would have "pinch" controls for the stems, enabling control over calls, media, and more. This will be quite a change, considering the previous Buds only offered swipe and tap gestures for controls.</p><p>The good news is Samsung is preparing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2024-confirmed">reveal its next wave of Galaxy devices</a> on July 10 in Paris, France at 9 am EDT.</p>
