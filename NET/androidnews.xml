<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google has redesigned some elements of its popular file management app.</li><li>Users will be able to view their recent files in the form of a carousel, just like their Memories on the Google Photos app.</li><li>The new change is seen in the latest beta and some official versions of the app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Files by Google app is getting a nifty new look when you glance through your recent files, which is very similar to what we have seen on the Google Photos app for quite a while now.</p><p>Until now, users were greeted with the "Recents" and "Categories" sections in the app when they opened the Files by Google app on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. The Recents tab is always used to showcase folders like Camera, Download, Screenshots, and Downloads (Documents) in grid form with a slight preview of the contents. </p><p>It is now changing with a new update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/29/google-files-recents-carousel/">9to5Google</a>), and the same Recent section will now greet you with a Stories-like carousel quite similar to what we see on Google Photos&apos; "Memories" up top.</p>
<p>Your handset&apos;s recent files can now be viewed in a carousel format. Rectangular cards show up as previews, and when tapped, the file/image opens in the full-screen view. </p><p>The cards are further accompanied by a three-dot menu, which lets you share, send to trash, or mark the respective file as "Starred." A total of ten cards can be viewed in the new carousel, after which users can hit the "see all" button on the top right to open up recent files segregated according to folder names.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="bRGZ3Z3NLR86c9wVHrEF36" name="Files-by-Google-new.jpg" alt="Files by Google New" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bRGZ3Z3NLR86c9wVHrEF36.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">New </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:338px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:177.51%;"><img id="KhLeegxBmMuzFwsE7RkPj" name="Files-by-Google-Old.jpg" alt="Files by Google Old view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KhLeegxBmMuzFwsE7RkPj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="338" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Old </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>While 9to5 points out that these new changes were spotted in the latest beta of the Files by Google app, we could also see the carousel in action with the same app bearing the <strong>1.4237.652465286.1-release</strong> version. Google Photos is one of the apps that showcase stories, such as the carousel feature; the Play Store also showcases similar cards in the popular "For You" section.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to see Google make these adjustments and provide a consistent user experience across all of its products. There&apos;s also the exciting aspect of these improvements occurring just before the official release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Spotify's Gemini extension progresses as a new app deep dive shows that it will utilize a user's "playlists, playback history, and preferences."</li><li>Typing "@Spotify" followed by your song of choice will prompt the AI to find and play the song through the main app.</li><li>Google added a YouTube Music extension on Android and desktop with three more in store, including one for Google Home.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A deep dive into the Google app has bolstered speculation about Gemini adding a Spotify extension for personalized music recommendations in the near future.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-gemini-extension-apk-teardown-3466912/">Android Authority</a> found code references in version 15.30.27.29 of the Google app that suggest at Spotify&apos;s future synergy with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. Specifically, the code offers a glimpse at the extension&apos;s permissions, which detail the use of your Spotify account&apos;s "playlists, playback history, and preferences."</p><p>Of course, this is all relevant information for Gemini to fulfill a user&apos;s request through the music streaming app. The permission page also states that "parts of your conversation" involving Spotify may be shared to "personalize" your music experience.</p><p>In the site&apos;s test, typing "@Spotify" in Gemini&apos;s pop-up window, followed by the name of a song, initiated the extension. The time it takes for Gemini to understand the request to pull up Spotify to play the song is reportedly a bit lengthy. But that&apos;s likely because it needs to fulfill the song request <em>and </em>pull up the app, in addition to the fact that it hasn&apos;t officially rolled out yet.</p><p>Nevertheless, the extension does trigger a Spotify song to play based on your request and account preferences, after the long wait. Tthe publication states that the extension can play requested music through the Spotify extension in the background without requiring the main app.</p>

<p>The latest deep dive offers a much more insightful glimpse at how Spotify&apos;s Gemini extension could perform after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-extension-potential-code-strings-discovered">brief mentions last time</a>. Early strings of code suggested that the extension would alert users to a music session by stating "Starting to Play on Spotify." The publication&apos;s app teardown now shows that the app may display the name of the song followed by "on Spotify."</p><p>What&apos;s more, both discoveries involved its operational abilities on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. It&apos;s still uncertain if this will work for those using Gemini on desktops. It also seems that Google is giving users more options for music streaming through Gemini as the AI model recently picked up one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">for YouTube Music</a> on Android and desktop.</p><p>Gemini&apos;s musical abilities are just one of a few AI extensions the company has planned. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-home-extensions-spotted">recent report suggests</a> Google is preparing to bring an extension for Google Home, the Phone app, and "Utilities."</p>

<ul><li>On X (formerly Twitter), OnePlus has started teasing an "Apex Edition" of its Open foldable phone.</li><li>The new edition sees the phone reimagined in a fiery red colorway, though its specs and pricing will remain hidden until its August 7 debut.</li><li>We're still eagerly awaiting the OnePlus Open 2, however, rumors claim it won't arrive in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up for a product variant<em> </em>reveal as teasers ramp up regarding its first foldable.</p><p>The Chinese company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/oneplus/status/1818995096240669028">posted a teaser on X</a> for an "Apex Edition" for the OnePlus Open (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-open-apex-edition-crimson-shadow-color-improved-specs-coming-soon_id161047">PhoneArena</a>). OnePlus calls the new red leather backing a "stunning Crimson Shadow," that aims to complement the pre-existing Emerald Dusk and Voyager Black colorways.</p><p>The post adds that the full reveal of the OnePlus Open Apex Edition will take place on August 7. Unfortunately, we&apos;ll have to wait until then for its price and tech specs. We know generally how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> looks and performs from our review, but it&apos;s possible OnePlus could differentiate its special edition with extra RAM or storage, as the site speculates.</p><p>OnePlus also specified that the Apex Edition will be granted three major Android OS releases and four years of security updates from launch. That&apos;s one year less than the OnePlus Open&apos;s other two colorways at launch; the Apex Edition&apos;s support will expire at the same time.</p><p>We don&apos;t know what OnePlus will charge for the Apex Edition, but a price increase is likely. It originally launched for $1,699 / CA$2,299 / ₹139,999.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A supreme form to rule them all. The #OnePlusOpen Apex Edition in stunning Crimson Shadow is coming August 7.<a href="https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1818995096240669028">August 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While this Apex Edition teaser is exciting in its own right, we&apos;re still left waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>. Rumors suggest that the foldable successor might not launch in 2024 due to OPPO taking a step back about launching the Find N5 series. Considering OPPO and OnePlus are sister companies under BBK Electronics, their devices (at times) overlap in terms of internal components and the like.</p><p>Those rumored continued to say the OnePlus Open 2 may rock Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, which would see it rolling out no sooner than late 2024, or more likely early 2025.</p><p>Taking that extra year could help push the OnePlus Open 2 into the limelight once again as the company looks to beef it up. We&apos;ll have to wait and see what it looks like, so for now, we have the Apex Edition to look forward to. The current-gen Open is already one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market.</p>

There might be millions of people using Meta Quest, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR headsets each and every month, but it&apos;s still not enough players to keep most multiplayer games properly populated. Yet, if I scroll through the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a>, a significant number of them are multiplayer-only games.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div>
<p>Multiplayer games keep people coming back again and again — especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-offers-vr-battle-royal-experiences-for-everyone">if they&apos;re regularly updated</a> like Population: One or Contractors Showdown — because they tend to offer a better long-term value to players not willing to shell out money for new games every month.</p><p>But those games need consistent player counts to keep people coming back regularly. Servers and updates are expensive, so multiplayer games simply can&apos;t survive without a regular stream of income through in-game microtransactions or something similar. </p><p>This presents an obvious conundrum. So, instead of continuing to launch more multiplayer-only games, developers will likely have to shift strategies to stay afloat.</p><p>That&apos;s where games like Zero Caliber 2 come in. With an 8-hour single-player campaign that can optionally be played co-op with up to 4 players, plus a 10-player multiplayer mode that has built-in mod support, Zero Caliber 2 has a real chance to keep players interested whether they want to play online or not.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s get this out of the way first. I didn&apos;t play the original Zero Caliber, although I&apos;ve heard good things about it. In all the right ways, it sounds like Zero Caliber 2 is the perfect sequel based on the description of the original and the 3,600 reviews for it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/3591949650852844/">Meta Horizon store</a>.</p><p>In essence, Zero Caliber 2 is akin to the VR version of the latest Call of Duty games. It features an in-depth multi-hour campaign filled with voice-acted characters, scripted sequences, incredible weapon handling and sound effects, and more action than you might expect in a standalone Quest game.</p><p>It&apos;s amazing because, if I were to imagine what a dream VR release would be in August 2024, a new shooting game isn&apos;t what would have made my list. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/contractors-showdown-meta-quest-3">Contractors Showdown</a> already scratched my itch for an amazing multiplayer battle royale game, and older titles like the original Contractors, the free-to-play battle royale Population: One, and several others are still going strong.</p><p>Back in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/tired-of-vr-shooting-games">I lamented</a> that we already had too many VR shooting games, but then Zero Caliber 2 came along to cut my narrative off at the knees.</p><p>Nothing wrong with a good surprise, right?</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The first time a pair of jets flew over my head I actually ducked.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Zero Caliber 2 is the VR shooting game I had no idea I wanted. I&apos;m not a Call of Duty player and I generally couldn&apos;t care less about any game of a similar vein. Yet, Zero Caliber 2 is one of my favorite VR games so far this year.</p><p>For starters, the game exudes a level of polish the VR industry needs to keep growing in a year with a few disappointing big-name titles like Stranger Things and the very early access Attack on Titan game that was just released. It&apos;s also a single-player game with the option of playing the entire campaign co-op alongside friends if they&apos;re available.</p><p>The amount of action in this game is truly awe-inspiring, and I marveled at the level of detail in each level as I made my way through neighborhoods, city streets, and harbors filled with battleships. The first time a pair of jets flew over my head, I actually ducked, and it was these kinds of scripted sequences and momentous events that kept me wondering what was around the next corner.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VeEmTJiumYcJj9FFXVkHfB" name="zero-caliber-2-official-screenshot-city.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Zero Caliber 2 running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VeEmTJiumYcJj9FFXVkHfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, it&apos;s one of the more impressive games I&apos;ve seen on Quest to date. It&apos;s incredibly crisp and clean since it runs at a crazy high resolution and even the assets and textures are higher quality than you&apos;ll find on most Quest games.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Being able to spend 30 minutes to run through a mission together after a busy day at work is a ton of fun and a great way to wind down without having to go anywhere.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The introductory level takes place in a neighborhood besieged by a terrorist organization. As you make your way from house to house, the level of excitement continues to grow as your adrenaline kicks in.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing quite so satisfying as clearing out enemies hiding in a house, moving quickly from room to room before they make their move to get you first. It&apos;s harrowing and unnerving, especially being in such a domestic situation in an otherwise heavily military-themed story.</p><p>Aside from the ziplines and impressive scripted sequences, I loved the fact that you could take nearly anything the enemies were using. From grenades to guns, weapons attachments, ammo, etc. There was no shortage of choices at my disposal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpmWU5kRo7z9RBQLLSvbBB" name="zero-caliber-2-official-screenshot-trench.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Zero Caliber 2 running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpmWU5kRo7z9RBQLLSvbBB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I experienced this portion of the campaign alone, I enjoyed almost the entirety of the rest of it alongside the father/son duo of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rufftalkvr.com/">Ruff Talk VR podcast</a>.</p><p>Being able to join alongside friends in a campaign like this made it feel even more authentic. While there are plenty of action movie tropes found along the way, this isn&apos;t a game that makes you feel like an unstoppable Rambo-type character, especially if you play at higher difficulties.</p><p>Rather, having a friend (or two or three) alongside creates the feeling of a squad, letting you be more strategic while taking out the terrorist threat. That&apos;s vitally important if you&apos;re going to finish the campaign, again, especially at higher difficulty levels.</p><p>The comradery even extends to when your character drops to zero HP in the game. As they lay there on the ground, you can physically grab their hand and pull them up, bringing them back into the action in the most VR way possible.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Having a friend (or two or three) alongside creates the feeling of a squad, letting you be more strategic while taking out the terrorist threat.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As you make your way through the story, you&apos;ll come across over 60 different weapons, all with realistic handling and sound effects. Now, I&apos;m not a gun nut, and I hardly know the difference between any of the rifles in the game — I&apos;m not sure I could even give you the letters and numbers of any of them correctly off the top of my head — but the level of detail in these weapons is exquisite.</p><p>To top it off, the game&apos;s weapon customization mechanics feel incredibly realistic and satisfying. Need to find a better scope for your current gun? Just look at the weapon, rip the old scope off, and attach the new one. The same goes for any enhancement you&apos;ll find along the way, from silencers to lasers, grips, extended magazines, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9UsCPym8a8TAvbgU3m8KyA" name="zero-caliber-2-official-screenshot-ice.jpg" alt="Official screenshots of Zero Caliber 2 running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9UsCPym8a8TAvbgU3m8KyA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn&apos;t have the chance to play the standard 10-player multiplayer mode — again, I&apos;m not usually interested in those types of modes or games — but it&apos;s there in case you like it. The built-in mod support also means that the community can develop new and interesting modes, mechanics, and maps, leaving the developers at Xreal to steer the overall ship instead of being heads down on expensive big updates.</p><p>As Zero Caliber 2 is now available on the Meta Horizon store, I can&apos;t wait to play through the campaign with more friends who are planning to pick it up. Spending 30 minutes running through a mission together after a busy day at work is a ton of fun and a great way to wind down without having to go anywhere.</p><p>My biggest hope is that we&apos;ll continue to see games like this debut throughout the year and beyond. There&apos;s nothing sadder in the gaming world than getting excited over an amazing game only to buy it and have a hard time playing because it&apos;s multiplayer-only and there aren&apos;t enough players. Thankfully, you won&apos;t have that problem here.</p>

The Fire Max 11 also boasts a good-looking 11-inch display and about 14 hours of battery life per charge, and this version comes without lockscreen ads, so you don&apos;t have to worry about that.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Fire Max 11</a> is Amazon's closest thing to a premium-level tablet, and Best Buy is currently selling it for $120 off as part of its back-to-school sale. With its good-looking 11-inch screen and up to 14 hours of battery life, it's a stellar tablet for most casual users. It features smooth performance, 128GB of expandable storage, and 8MP cameras, along with the option to bundle with an Amazon stylus and keyboard. The retailer is also throwing in three free months of YouTube Premium with your purchase.  </p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a good deal on an already-affordable tablet; you need something with a large display; battery life is a major selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need a tablet with more than 128GB of storage or 4GB of RAM; you don&apos;t want to have to side-load to use Google Play Store apps.</p><p>The Fire Max 11 tablet is easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">best Fire tablets</a> out there, and it&apos;s also got the best and largest screen of any of Amazon&apos;s tablets at 11 inches and a 2000x1200 resolution. This version comes with 128GB of storage, a microSD slot for up to 1TB, and around 14 hours of battery life with every charge. You can also find first-party accessories like a detachable keyboard case and a USI 2.0 stylus, though you&apos;ll need to purchase them separately.</p><p>Though it only has a MediaTek MTK8188J octa-core processor, and 4GB of RAM is pretty low, we still found performance to be pretty smooth and quick on the Fire Max 11. As a couple of other potential downsides, the screen includes a 60Hz refresh rate, which is not enough for everyone, and this tablet requires side-loading of the Play Store if you were hoping to use any Google OS apps.</p><p>To be sure, there are better tablets out there, especially if you&apos;re willing to pay more. But if you were already shopping around for one on the lower-priced end of the spectrum, this might be a good option for your needs—and an extra $120 off doesn&apos;t hurt, either.</p>

<ul><li>Google is detailing a few AI features Chrome users on desktop can expect over the next few weeks.</li><li>Such features include the debut of Google Lens in Chrome on computers, adding visual search abilities, follow-up questions, and multisearch.</li><li>Chrome on desktop also picks up "Tab Compare" when searching for multiple products and conversational AI for rediscovering your browsing history.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has developed a few new AI tools for Chrome, arriving for users today (August 1) in a big way.</p><p>In a press release, the company states that Chrome on desktop is picking up three new AI features, beginning with Google Lens on desktop. Those same capabilities we&apos;re used to on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> will hit computers via a Lens icon in the address bar. </p><p>Google states users can click the icon, which will attach a mini Lens icon to their mouse. You then "click and drag" over an area on your display to have Lens run a visual search. The search begins immediately after finishing your area highlight. Chrome will display relevant search results in a new side panel to the right.</p><p>Those on Android will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">be familiar with multisearch</a>, another feature desktop users won&apos;t miss out on. Google adds that after the initial query is run, users can click the text bar at the top of the results panel to add more. Users can refine the search by color, brand, or other details. Moreover, you can toss in a follow-up question to keep Chrome&apos;s AI going.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43YUCNEHBHU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Lens in Chrome on desktop also lets you highlight text in a video to "quickly get a description in the side panel." Discovering new merchandise like backpacks or dresses is also possible by simply highlighting the object and letting the AI do its thing.</p><p>This feature will begin rolling out "over the next few days."</p><p>"Tab Compare" is another new AI-backed feature for Chrome that lets users see a quick AI-generated product comparison using <em>your </em>tabs. Google states that when users are browsing different devices (say, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>) switching tabs is often the norm. However, Tab Compare will collect the information you have spread across those tabs and Chrome is said to "suggest" that users open this AI-generated comparison to save time.</p><p>The comparison page will display the name of each product you&apos;ve got open in your tabs alongside pricing, reviews, and other technical specs.</p><p>The "next few weeks" will bring this feature to all desktop Chrome users.</p>

<p>Chrome&apos;s final AI feature feels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">reminiscent of Gemini</a> as the company plugs in more conversational software to rediscover your history. Soon, users can ask Chrome a question about a previous site they&apos;ve visited. Chrome will then display in its address bar "Search History" with a magnifying glass and a classic Google AI star, indicating the conversational AI&apos;s presence.</p><p>From there, Chrome&apos;s drop-down menu will pull information from your browsing history to show website links that might solve your query. Google states that this feature is optional and users can enable or disable it via the settings. More importantly, those rolling in incognito mode will never have sites visited appear when using this AI search.</p><p>Chrome&apos;s AI history search will begin rolling out to U.S. users "in the coming weeks."</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus app's teardown reveals a new AI feature likely in the works.</li><li>The popular AI Summary feature on OnePlus phones might extend to OnePlus Buds.</li><li>If the feature goes live, future OnePlus Buds will be able to create call transcripts via AI.</li><li>The leaked OnePlus Buds 3 Pro could be the first to feature this tool.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is reportedly integrating a handy new AI feature into its wireless earbuds to generate call AI summaries, according to new findings from an APK teardown.</p><p>The APK teardown, done by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-buds-ai-call-summaries-apk-teardown-3466073/">Android Authority</a>, reveals a new AI call summaries feature, which can be carried out through OnePlus wireless earbuds. The findings were seen via the OnePlus Buds app bearing the <strong>14.8.2 version</strong>. The publication&apos;s screenshot of the app reveals the new AI Call Assistant toggle. Once enabled, users would need to press their compatible OnePlus Buds&apos; stem three times, which can trigger the AI summary for calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="R4T4fsZDyusL7QWzSaCvvE" name="OnePlus-Buds-app-AI-call-summari.jpg" alt="OnePlus Buds app AI Summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R4T4fsZDyusL7QWzSaCvvE.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="2700" height="6000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First discovered back in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-12-receives-new-ai-features">OnePlus&apos; AI Call Summarizer</a> automatically extracts key information like instructions, addresses, names, or phone numbers from a phone call. Currently available on OnePlus phones, this will now work as a hands-free option when you take Bluetooth calls through your OnePlus Buds. </p><p>Needless to say, the said AI summarize feature will only work with compatible earbuds alongside a supported OnePlus phone that also sports an AI summary function, like the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-with-snapdragon-7-plus-gen-3-goes-official">OnePlus Nord 4</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Users further have to bear in mind that if the supported OnePlus phone, for some reason, is in power-saving mode, meditation mode, or children&apos;s space mode, the AI summary mode might not work effectively. Other than that, next to the calls, AI summaries also work for online meetings made through supported third-party applications.</p><p>Lastly, as Android Authority notes, the compatible OnePlus Buds in question are likely the upcoming OnePlus Buds Pro 3. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-oneplus-buds-pro-3-design-specs-revealed-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank">SmartPrix</a> leaked the Buds Pro 3 design and specs on Wednesday, suggesting they&apos;ll arrive soon as a successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>While these AI features could come to the Buds Pro 3 first, we expect these AI features to trickle down to older earbuds from the company, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a>.</p>

Billed a great phone for creators, it also hosts new ideas about repairability and is dead simple for anyone — not just a skilled technician — to open and perform basic repairs and replacements.</p><p>It&apos;s also the first Android phone to be widely released that supports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 standard</a> out of the box. You don&apos;t need a case or a fancy black plate to use the new generation of wireless charging on this one.</p>
<p>I&apos;m a nerd. I have this cool new pink phone (it&apos;s so very pink) with fancy camera features, and what I really care about is how easy it is to tear it apart so I can look at things like the Qi2 charging coil (spoiler: it&apos;s disappointing and a Qi2 coil looks very much like a Qi coil.) That&apos;s mostly because I don&apos;t think Qi2 is a good idea.</p><p>It may sound like blasphemy, and people who want wireless charging with all the convenience of magnets may disagree, but in the long term, I believe Qi2 is going to stifle innovation in this area.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qi2-and-why-is-it-great-2">What is Qi2 and why is it great?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nUxw9PjtmJ2EGrFZhV92Pi" name="iOttie-Velox-Mini-Qi2-Air-Vent-Mount-ring-01.jpg" alt="iOttie Velox Mini Qi2 Air Vent Mount" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUxw9PjtmJ2EGrFZhV92Pi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qi2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe</a>. It&apos;s not "like MagSafe," it <em>is</em> MagSafe because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23538131/qi2-wireless-charging-apple-samsung">Apple provided what was needed for free</a> to the standards committee. It&apos;s now an open standard from the WPC (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/qi2/">Wireless Power Consortium</a>) that defines how wireless charging coils can be combined with a "magnetic power profile" to ensure the coil in the charger and the coil in the phone are perfectly aligned. In layman&apos;s terms, it is the original Qi wireless standard with Apple&apos;s MagSafe idea attached to it.</p><p>This is not a bad thing. It&apos;s great that Apple was willing to contribute and give up its usual MFi certification or requirement of genuine Apple hardware and provide a working profile standard. By making sure the coils are properly aligned, devices will charge faster and waste less power. It&apos;s also not as easy as you might think it is because magnets can easily interfere with inductive (wireless) charging — especially when nearby like they are in Qi2-certified devices.</p>
<p>It&apos;s also a really good idea for most phone makers and consumers. At least in the short term. Standards mean you can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">same wireless charger</a> for both an iPhone and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> as long as both support them. Since the standard is open and free for anyone to use the list of supported devices will be a lot higher.</p><p>For phone makers like HMD, it means they do not have to engineer their own solutions. The company knows that if it follows the standard, you can buy a compatible charger and it just works. </p><p>In almost every case a standard is a good thing, and we should get behind them even if it means a little more regulation when enforcing them. Almost every case.</p>
<h2 id="what-apos-s-wrong-with-qi2-2">What&apos;s wrong with Qi2?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="XWXF2Wm2NkY6eKfREU4Qz3" name="qi-charger.jpg" alt="Qi charging coil" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XWXF2Wm2NkY6eKfREU4Qz3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Nothing is wrong with Qi2 today</strong>. It&apos;s a way to deliver wireless charging to any device in a safe way, using cheap commercially available chargers without the markup of a name brand attached. It&apos;s important to remember that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-charging-plain-english">copper wire, magnets, and plastic</a> are the same regardless of which company uses them. With certification, you can be assured that a cheap charger from Amazon is as safe and effective as an expensive one with a big tech company&apos;s name on it.</p><p>This is a good thing, but it&apos;s also a problem. A company like HMD may not be ready to dedicate the time and money to a five-person team to develop a better way to align a wireless charger, but Apple, Samsung, or OnePlus will.</p>
<p>If OnePlus — a company known for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-has-30w-wireless-charging-heres-how-it-works">pushing the limits when it comes to charging tech</a> — does develop a new and better way, it would need to build a device that works poorly (if at all) with existing equipment you probably already have. If you buy a phone that claims to charge wirelessly in 30 minutes, having it take three hours to charge with your existing equipment is a bad look.</p><p>That&apos;s what would happen because of the way "compatibility" is managed with the Qi2 standard. If it works and is safe, but it doesn&apos;t have approved and certified Qi2 components, it cuts charging rates to the bare minimum. This wastes power and lengthens your charging time, defeating the very idea of Qi2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NVZcecvwYGwFcujFKEroRj" name="OnePlus-Warp-Charge-wireless-one-plus-9.jpg" alt="A OnePlus 9 Pro on the OnePlus Warp Charge wireless charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NVZcecvwYGwFcujFKEroRj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Hayato Huseman / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Magnetic charging" isn&apos;t new. Sony and Samsung offered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-nexus-10-review">magnetic charging systems</a> more than 10 years ago, and everyone remembers Apple&apos;s magnetic MacBook chargers. The difference now is that the charging methods and standards are tied to the magnetic latching system.</p><p>If this all sounds like techno-nerd babble, I get it. What I&apos;m saying is that OnePlus, for example, has no incentive to build a better system because nothing it makes will work well with everything that&apos;s out there right now. Wireless charging is just like that because of how it works; it sort of has to be. For now, anyway. What if OnePlus could change that?</p>
<p>It&apos;s a big ask, but I would love to see the magnetic power profile part of Qi2 separated from the wireless power transfer part. Ideally, Qi2 would be the latest wireless transfer standard and something like QiM could handle things like clearance and placements of magnetic points of attachment. I hate that they are bundled together, even if it&apos;s an <em>optional</em> standard.</p><p>This way, OnePlus could build it better but maintain compatibility in a way that makes its new powerful wireless charger not suck. Until then, you won&apos;t want to use anything new or different.</p>

<hr>
<p>There have been plenty of rumblings about the future of Google TV over the last few months. First, we learned that a Chromecast with Google TV 4K successor was imminent. Then, Walmart’s sub-brand Onn launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">new Google TV 4K Pro</a> device, and it quickly became the best Google TV box you can buy. Now, we know that the Chromecast with Google TV 4K replacement isn’t another streaming stick — it’s a streaming box, more akin to the Apple TV.  </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/google-tv-streamer/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first uncovered the existence of a new set-top box, dubbed the “Google TV Streamer.” Unlike most streaming boxes, which have a small surface area and a taller design, the Google TV Streamer is like a flat wedge. It looks like it’ll fit into the Google Home and Google Nest ecosystems well since it looks like part of a Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max. If you imagine hard enough, you can even spot the resemblance to the Pixel Tablet speaker dock, as 9to5Google pointed out.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer would mark a shift in Google&apos;s strategy and streaming efforts. The entire point of its streaming sticks was to conveniently plug into the back of a TV and stay out of the way. Products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-hd-review">Chromecast with Google TV HD</a> and Chromecast with Google TV 4K were made to be relatively cheap, low-powered, and virtually invisible once installed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4v6F8gUY7aFFgctHBCfQRR" name="onn-walmart-4k-tv-pro-remote-chromecast-google-tv-remote-amazon-fire-tv-remote.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro remote with the Chromecast remote and Fire TV remote" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4v6F8gUY7aFFgctHBCfQRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the Google TV Streamer isn’t trying to be hidden. It looks like one of the larger streaming boxes we’ve seen lately, at least in terms of service area. It also could be trying to provide more power and a premium feature set. Early reports about the Chromecast with Google TV 4K revealed that the product’s successor would almost certainly include a chip upgrade, perhaps with more RAM and storage. Now, the new form factor for the Google TV Streamer likely means it would offer more ports. </p><p>That much may have been confirmed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/HFS-GRS6B" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/28/google-tv-streamer-fcc/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The FCC ID, HFS-GRS6B, is associated with Quanta Computer, Inc. — not Google. However, as 9to5Google notes, Quanta Computer has produced Google products in the past, including the Pixelbook, Pixel Slate, and Pixelbook Go. </p><p>The filing notes that there is at least an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a USB-C port. The wireless device referenced in the listing runs Android since the Android Debug Bridge was used for testing. Additionally, it features a Thread radio that can be used to interact with other smart devices.</p><p>That makes the Google TV Streamer sound like a higher-end version of the Chromecast with Google TV 4K, but there are other attributes that point to the contrary. For example, the Wi-Fi 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n and Wi-Fi 5GHz 802.11a/n/ac support referenced in the regulatory filing is far from the latest and greatest. There also isn’t ultra-wideband (UWB) support mentioned, which would prevent the Google TV Streamer from working with software features like Tap to Cast. </p>

<p>Now that the Google TV Streamer appears to be taking the set-top box form factor, the Apple TV is a natural competitor. Apple’s streaming box uses Apple silicon chips that are old, but still dwarfs the low-end processors found in current Chromecast streaming sticks. That helps the Apple TV 4K play games, deliver solid software experiences, and support plenty of video and audio formats. Apple’s form factor also supports Ethernet for faster streaming speeds.</p><p>It’s nice to see that Google may be following suit by offering more ports on the rumored Google TV Streamer. Ethernet is a huge plus, and facilitates a better experience overall. You won’t have to worry about buffering while trying to watch video content, or whether your Google TV box is too far away from your router. A wired internet connection still trumps wireless, and that’s why Ethernet would be a great addition to Google’s next streaming device.</p><p>However, there are reasons to be concerned about Google’s ability to compete with the Apple TV. For starters, we don’t know what processor will be inside the Google TV Streamer, and that will have a big impact on real-world performance. Plus, the omission of modern Wi-Fi specifications and UWB support makes me wonder what kind of price point the Google TV Streamer will target. Is it a higher-end Google TV device, or is it just a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">Chromecast with Google TV</a> replacement in a different form?</p><p>The answer to that question might determine whether the Google TV Streamer will give the Apple TV a run for its money. Google has an event coming up shortly, so here’s to hoping we see more about the company’s smart home plans there. We’re looking forward to potentially seeing a Google TV Streamer debut, but a revamp of the Google Home and Nest product lines would be nice, too.</p>

It&apos;s a good thing — it makes a stolen device almost impossible to use, which makes it less appealing to thieves, and anything that can protect our data on the devices we&apos;ve lost is welcome.</p><p>It can become a problem if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-refurbished-phone">sell, trade, or even give away a phone</a> without factory resetting it, though. How it works explains why.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.34%;"><img id="qqZVBGLRi7AzNfGGxyAFiQ" name="op6tfingerprint.gif" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qqZVBGLRi7AzNfGGxyAFiQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="640" height="431" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Simply put, FRP uses the credentials of the last account on the device to permit wiping or resetting the phone.</p><p>You have to be signed in with the "owner" account (the one you used to set it up) to factory reset it. That means if you give me your phone, I can&apos;t reset it without you being signed in. There are random workarounds on the Internet, but they tend to get patched almost as soon as they are discovered and you probably don&apos;t want to try random software you found on YouTube.</p><p>You&apos;ll pretty much need to know the login details for the last account to use the device before you can reset it and create a new owner account. Note that this means you may need to have the password or PIN, not just have access to a fingerprint.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve been bitten by this ourselves. We ship phones all over North America and the U.K., and sometimes it&apos;s easy to forget you&apos;re still signed in when you stick a phone in a box. And yes, we have needed to share a password to get past the initial setup because of other policies Google has in place to protect your account.</p>
<p>This is a bit of an inconvenience, but it&apos;s understandable because FRP is in place to make sure your data is safe if you lose your device or it gets stolen.</p><p>You do have to remember the one critical rule: <strong>If you change or reset your Google account password, you shouldn&apos;t use it to wipe a phone that&apos;s using it for 72 hours</strong>. If you do this, Google can (and has) lock down your entire account. If this happens you&apos;ll need to try and contact Google support to get it fixed. Nobody wants that so change it and wait a few days.</p>
<h2 id="disable-it-the-right-way-2">Disable it the right way</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xDYn85tVjymLmMThTWmNKN" name="how-to-factory-reset-fitbit-smartwatch-1.jpg" alt="How To Factory Reset Fitbit Smartwatch 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xDYn85tVjymLmMThTWmNKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disabling FRP (Factory Reset Protection) is simple. On most phones, it will be automatically done whenever you choose to reset the data through the phone&apos;s settings. If your phone has an extra layer of reset protection from the company who built it or has a "find my phone" app from the company who built it, you&apos;ll want to disable that manually first.</p>
<p>There may be a few devices still in use that require a bit more hands-on work. If your phone is really old, you <strong>might</strong> need to remove the accounts that are signed in manually:</p>
<ul><li>Open your device settings and remove any security you have for the lock screen. This isn't a required step for all phones, but some want you to do this, so we're including it here.</li><li>Once that's done, you need to remove any and all Google Accounts from the phone or tablet. That's also done in the settings — look for a section labeled Accounts. With an account selected, look for a delete or remove option, usually hidden behind the three little dots in the top corner of the screen.</li><li>When you've made sure all of the Google accounts have been erased, you can then factory reset your phone or tablet through the device settings.</li></ul>
<p>On modern Android phones, there shouldn&apos;t be any problems as long as you choose to factory reset your phone through its settings. This will automatically remove all the associated accounts in a way that "frees" the phone from FRP. If you try to reset a phone through the bootloader, FRP will kick in, and it can&apos;t be set back up without the previous account&apos;s password.</p>
<p>You can make sure any reset protection has been removed from a phone you want to find a new owner for. Just try to sign back into it after you&apos;ve reset it.</p><p><strong>If it asks for the previous username and password, FRP is still enabled.</strong> If it doesn&apos;t, you&apos;re good to go: power it off and box it up!</p>
<h2 id="oops-too-late-i-already-sent-it-2">Oops! Too late, I already sent it.</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.63%;"><img id="jA4kiePQfUR22kSAurbezF" name="google-passwords-pixel-5-2021.jpg" alt="Google Passwords Pixel 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jA4kiePQfUR22kSAurbezF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="533" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;ve forgotten to turn off FRP and send a phone to someone else, you&apos;ll likely need to help them get it set up. <strong>This means giving them access to your Google account password</strong>. The only other reasonable option is to have it returned so you can do it yourself.</p>
<p>If you choose to let someone know your Google credentials, do it while you are on the phone with them. Give them the password to your account and have them verify that it worked, and they can continue the setup process. <strong>Then immediately </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/41078?hl=en"><strong>change your Google account password</strong></a><strong>, as well as any other accounts that might have been using the same password.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember to not erase or delete the Google account from another phone for 72 hours after you&apos;ve done this!</strong> If you try, you may be locked out of your account and need to speak with someone at Google to resolve everything.</p>
<p>While we haven&apos;t seen headlines telling us mobile phone theft is down by any measurable percentage since FRP was enabled, it&apos;s still a good way to keep your data safe. And it&apos;s pretty easy to disable when you want someone else to be able to use your old phone.</p>
