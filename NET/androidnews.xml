<ul><li>Sunbird, the messaging app that aimed to bring iMessage to Android users, announced Friday that it is relaunching in beta.</li><li>The original app quickly shut down after users exposed critical security and privacy flaws that left user messages susceptible to being intercepted.</li><li>The company added a page to its website detailing what went wrong the first time around and what has been changed since.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunbird, the messaging app that infamously partnered with Nothing to bring iMessage to Android <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sunbird-pulls-app-from-playstore">before being swiftly shut down</a>, is now returning. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunbird-messaging-announces-beta-app-relaunch-enhancing-connectivity-and-security-302109405.html" target="_blank">announced</a> Friday, April 5, that it would relaunch the beta version of its app after making changes to its backend infrastructure. Sunbird says that over 165,000 users have registered for the app&apos;s waitlist and that invitations will become available in small phases.</p><p>The first time around, Sunbird brought iMessage to Android through its own app and the Nothing Chats app. Nothing, the Android phone manufacturer behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, wanted to make all of its devices compatible with iMessage through Nothing Chats. However, users quickly discovered that the messages and internal processes were unencrypted, leaving user messages and shared files available for anyone to access. </p><p>Sunbird explained the technical changes to its iMessage architecture, intended to increase security and fix the original app&apos;s privacy woes, on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sunbirdapp.com/update-security-incident-remediation-and-sunbird-re-launch" target="_blank">website</a>. If you&apos;re curious or skeptical, here they are: </p>
<ul><li>Unencrypted messages are never stored anywhere on disk or in a database. When messages are decrypted to be passed to the iMessage and RCS/Google Messages network, they exist in that state only within memory for a limited period of time. In the front-end app, messages are only stored in an encrypted state within the in-app database.</li><li>Static files transmitted through the service are stored in secure cloud storage buckets that are encrypted in transit and at rest. They are protected through permissioned URLs that prevent unauthorized access and are completely expunged from the Sunbird systems no later than 48 hours after sending or receiving them.</li><li>All communication from the Sunbird app to the Sunbird API is protected at the transport layer, either through HTTPS or the MQTTS protocol.</li><li>The MQTTS broker is secured via strict access control lists to ensure that users are only able to access broker topics specifically assigned to them and no others.</li><li>Further, the contents of the message payload itself is encrypted at the application layer using AES encryption with an encryption key controlled completely by the client and only held in memory on the Sunbird side. Messages flow through the Sunbird system in an encrypted state and are only decrypted (in memory) at the moment of transfer of messages to the native messaging platform.</li></ul>
<p>Sunbird also indirectly mentions Beeper in its press release, which discontinued support for its iMessage client — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-mini-removed-from-the-play-store">called Beeper Mini</a> — after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/beeper-gives-android-imessage-app-one-more-go">repeated moves by Apple</a> to shut it down. The company claims that Sunbird is a solution to the iMessage compatibility problem that doesn&apos;t take steps to provide unauthorized access to Apple&apos;s iMessage servers. Ironically, Sunbird points out the "security and privacy concerns" related to Beeper Mini due to the app&apos;s "unauthorized access to iMessage."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7PHSHKgTneXCZo78APxUB3" name="beeper-mini-app-oneplus-open-iphone-15-pro-max.jpg" alt="Beeper Mini app on OnePlus Open Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PHSHKgTneXCZo78APxUB3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it&apos;s up to end users to decide whether Sunbird is actually worth trusting. For what it&apos;s worth, the company has already been caught in the middle of a discrepancy again. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/05/sunbird-imessage-android-return/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>  noticed that Sunbird claimed that it brought on Jared Jordan, a Google engineering director, as a formal advisor. However, Jordan&apos;s LinkedIn page reveals that he left the company months ago. Sunbird quietly updated its website to change the wording around Jordan&apos;s past experience, with no mention or acknowledgment of the change. </p><p>Sunbird says that the reason the company pulled the app for months was due to its "unwavering commitment to the privacy and security of our users." Instead of shipping a quick fix, Sunbird opted to rebuild its internal architecture entirely.</p><p>Still, it remains to be seen whether users trust Sunbird again. The app still has a long way to go, as it is now starting over from scratch in a very limited beta.</p>

Opening <strong>Settings</strong>, followed by the <strong>Battery</strong> option.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Battery usage</strong>, and you&apos;ll see the apps that have been using the most battery power since the last full charge.</p><p>The option doesn&apos;t tell you directly if the battery health is good or not, but it does give you helpful information on how much power your phone has, and you can see if your phone lasts as long as it did before but with data to back it up. </p>

<p>All Samsung Galaxy phones come with an app that allows you to check your phone&apos;s battery health. The Members app will enable you to diagnose and optimize your phone. You can also share reviews and tips with other Galaxy users. To open the app, swipe up from the bottom of your display and type "Members" in the search bar. Once the app is open:</p><p>1.

<p>If your phone&apos;s battery is good, that&apos;s excellent news. You can use other battery-related options, such as battery optimization, but if you would rather keep apps running, you can always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-battery-optimization-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">turn them off</a>. If the battery health is weak, you can try taking it for service since Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-ubreakifix-expand-repair-options">partnered with repair shops like uBreakiFix</a> for phone repairs and part replacements. You might want to consider getting yourself a new phone, maybe the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>. Any excuse is good when it comes to an upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-check-battery-health-for-using-a-dial-code-2">How to check battery health for using a dial code</h2>
<p>There is a dial code trick you can try, but it doesn&apos;t work on all Android phones.</p><p>1. Open the dial-pad and enter <strong>*#*#4636#*#*</strong></p><p>2. Without having to do anything else, you should see a menu with options such as Phone information, Usage statistics, and Wi-Fi information.</p><p>3. Look for the <strong>Battery information</strong> option, but if you don&apos;t see it, don&apos;t worry. The following section will show you how to get battery health information regardless of your Android phone.</p><p>Some phones don&apos;t have the battery option. But entering the code does nothing on Samsung models, while other models at least show a menu. Some phones support it, and others don&apos;t. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-battery-health-info-with-third-party-apps-2">How to get battery health info with third-party apps</h2>
<p>You can use free third-party apps to get the battery health information you need. One popular app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery">AccuBattery</a>. However, you might not like that it won&apos;t give you a health report right away, since it needs time to gather information. </p><p>If you&apos;re like me and you want the information now, you can try apps such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">Ampere</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere">DevCheck Device System Info</a>. These apps will tell you how healthy your phone&apos;s battery is within a few seconds of installing them. When I swiped left, I could choose from different information layouts on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-know-if-your-android-battery-is-damaged-2">How to know if your Android battery is damaged?</h2>
<p>A phone battery that is not in good condition shows it&apos;s struggling. But how do you know <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-tell-when-phones-battery-has-gone-bad">when your phone&apos;s battery has gone bad</a>? One of the various signs is that your phone won&apos;t charge to 100% and drains very quickly when it reaches a full charge. If the battery looks swollen, that is a clear sign that your phone needs a new battery. Does your Android phone take longer than usual to charge?  </p><p>Battery health is not the same as battery life since battery health is how well the battery performs, like holding a charge. Battery life is how much power you have until you need to charge your phone again. But before assuming it&apos;s the battery, you can try using a new charging cable and block to avoid that possibility.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-android-phone-apos-s-battery-healthy-2">Keep your Android phone&apos;s battery healthy</h2>
<p>Besides knowing how healthy your Android phone&apos;s battery is, it&apos;s also important to understand how to take care of your battery. By knowing what not to do, you can keep your phone in good shape. All Android users should also know various tips for extending the life of their phone&apos;s battery. That way, you don&apos;t have to waste time taking it for service or get a new phone.</p><p>Here are just some tips to keep in mind when it comes to taking care of your phone&apos;s battery:</p>
<ul><li>Charge your phone when it needs a charge and remove it from the charger when it's finished. Don't be afraid to use a wireless charger.</li><li>Use quick charging sparingly if you're concerned about its effect on battery lifespan. There is little immediate damage or danger from using the right charging method for your phone.</li><li>Try to manually shut your phone off if the charge ever drops below 10% and leave it off while charging it for a few minutes.</li><li>Never store a phone with a dead battery and check on a stored phone periodically.</li><li>Don't buy cheap chargers or cables from the gas station or that dude at the flea market. Use the type of charger the people who made your phone recommend.</li></ul>
<p>Whether you have a new Samsung phone or an older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-lg-phones">LG phone</a>, the tips for keeping your phone healthy apply. But now, with the free battery apps on Google Play, you can monitor your battery health.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's upcoming affordable smartwatch is tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE.</li><li>It is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4, indicates a new leak based on model numbers.</li><li>The Galaxy Watch FE is expected to release alongside the Galaxy Watch 7 later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It is rumored that Samsung will bring a Fan Edition Galaxy Watch for the first time this year. While there have been minimal details about that till now, new information heavily suggests it is indeed happening.</p><p>We first heard about the Fan Edition Galaxy Watch, tentatively named Galaxy Watch FE, earlier this year, implying that it would come on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-is-coming.html">Android Headlines</a> corroborates the same with new information. It is seemingly a new version of Galaxy Watch 4, which will be renamed the Galaxy Watch FE.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:841px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:19.62%;"><img id="jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-FE-leak.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch FE leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDzQNuBXHhsK2jGwBhfqDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="841" height="165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Headlines further notes that the Galaxy Watch FE will be seen in the global, U.S., and Korean markets with corresponding model numbers bearing <strong>SM-R866F</strong>, <strong>SM-R866U</strong>, and <strong>SM-R866N</strong>, respectively. For the unaware, the Galaxy Watch 4 also featured the <strong>SM-R860F</strong> model number — the similarities between these numbers further establish that the Galaxy Watch FE is most likely a revamped version of the Galaxy Watch 4.</p><p>If the previous Fan Edition products from Samsung are any indication, with the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE, we can expect some of the goodies from the then flagship smartwatch model.</p><p>Meanwhile, we have also recently seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-announced">Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)</a> refresh after two years of launch, dubbed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022). While most of the parameters between both tablets remained the same, the 2024 model came with a new chipset underneath.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-hands-on-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Hands On" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpPfxLZvPDpSYEzgFz5bjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, alongside bringing some highlights from the Galaxy Watch 4, the upcoming Galaxy Watch FE is expected to have a new, rumored Exynos chipset for better performance.</p><p>The fact that it&apos;s an FE model also means it will be an affordable offering, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-could-launch-in-2024">previous rumor</a> indicates that the Galaxy Watch FE will cater to the mid-range, competing against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best affordable smartwatches</a>, something that Wear OS hasn&apos;t really tapped into when it comes to new model releases. As for the Galaxy Watch FE release, it is expected to launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series (which may include Pro and Classic models) later in the year, presumably next to the Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google Wallet is now rolling out its support for Apple Wallet passes to more users following its limited availability in March.</li><li>Its functionality is not working properly as users face errors when downloading a pass saved in Apple's ".pkpass" format.</li><li>Support for Apple's standard pass format joins Google's work to bring more boarding passes to its Wallet app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems that Google Wallet is activating support for Apple Wallet passes for more users, but a problem has been spotted early on.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/04/google-wallet-apple-wallet-pass-files-how/">9to5Google</a>, the ability of Google Wallet users to access important ".pkpass" files has become widely available to more users. This file format is Apple&apos;s format used for digital passes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the publication has spotted a frustrating problem with Wallet&apos;s support for Apple&apos;s format: not every <em>app </em>supports it on Android.</p><p>It was discovered that the "Add to Apple Wallet" option consistently failed to appear in a few Android apps. Services weren&apos;t giving users the appropriate Apple file format for them to throw into Google Wallet for safekeeping. Another attempt delivered an error when adding some minor league baseball tickets to Wallet.</p><p>The error prompted users to try opening the link in Safari (the default browser on iOS), but Android users cannot do that.</p><p>The report adds that users can use an iPhone to transfer a pass to their Android device if problems become too troublesome. The publication states users can "share a pass via messaging and other apps" from an iPhone to an Android device, which will deliver the necessary ".pkpass" for them to import into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>More users should begin noticing support for Apple&apos;s digital pass format available on Android today (Apr. 5) and beyond. More importantly, apps should also start conforming to this newfound support, but it will likely take time to iron out the errors.</p>

<p>Android users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-support-apple-wallet-file-format">started noticing support</a> for Apple&apos;s pass format in March, though it was constricted to a smaller number. Such support has been coming for a long time, as Google stated it was working on implementing functionality back in 2022. However, evidence of the feature in development was only spotted in 2023.</p><p>The latest support for Wallet is one of many, as Google recently brought in additional support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">more boarding passes</a> directly from Gmail. Users receiving confirmation emails for movies and flights can now easily pop those passes into Google Wallet. The update also included archiving older passes, keeping what&apos;s important clean and concise.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing confirms on X that it plans to unveil the "Ear" and "Ear a" buds on April 18.</li><li>The company states that the name change will help it better focus on the "product" and "unique experience" it provides for consumers.</li><li>Little information about the devices has leaked, but the existence of an "a" tag for one suggests it could fall on the budget side like the Phone 2a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has been confirmed, but consumers will be treated to two earbud launches from the London-based company later this month.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1776236686340464931?s=20">posted on X</a> today (Apr. 5), stating folks should get ready to see the Nothing "Ear" and "Ear a" on April 18. Essentially, the newly announced "Ear" is the successor to the Ear 2 launched in March 2023. The post adds that the upcoming devices are the "ultimate iteration of Nothing audio" and "reflect the culmination of three years of design and innovation."</p><p>This also (obviously) comes with a curious name change that makes it seem like we&apos;re restarting the series. Nothing states the purpose of its naming strategy reset, which includes removing the series number, is to better focus on "the product and the unique experience."</p><p>The company reiterated that it will continue to create premium devices for consumers that prioritize user preference over price.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We started Nothing with audio in 2021 and since our very first product, we’ve relentlessly refined our design and engineering with every new addition to our audio product suite. 2024 is the year we’re unveiling the ultimate iteration of Nothing Audio with two new products that… pic.twitter.com/bRrFzk9wUl<a href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1776236686340464931">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-3-frog-beetle-teaser">started teasing</a> its new earbud device late in March, and the provided teasers made it seem like we were continuing to the Ear 3. The post featured a little tree frog leaping over a black beetle. The latter was used to promote the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear 2</a> before it launched in 2023.</p><p>The most interesting development is that we&apos;re set to receive an "Ear a" to accompany the, assumedly, "flagship-level" buds. With the "a" moniker, the second pair of buds seems to follow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>: a budget phone that came with a premium-level design and some slight software/hardware changes to keep the price down.</p><p>We don&apos;t exactly have much to bite into as Nothing has spilled much information regarding either of the devices. We can refer to Ear 2 as a device that features refined sound and improved ANC capabilities. The device also gained a smaller charging case to make it easier to carry around. Internally, it picked up an 11.6mm custom driver for rich sound.</p><p>It remains to be seen where Nothing will go after its 2023 release. Fortunately, we only have a couple of weeks to wait.</p>

<ul><li>The latest Android 14 beta contains information regarding Google's development of a desktop mode overhaul for Android 15.</li><li>The overhaul would fully revamp its freeform mode, giving users more agency over how to manage multiple windows.</li><li>Other Android 15 news involves additional features for its "Private Spaces" and a potential new status bar later this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>More of what Android 15 could have in store surfaces as a discovery shows Google is preparing some long-awaited improvements to desktop mode.</p><p>As detailed by Mishaal Rahman with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-desktop-mode-demo-3430991/">Android Authority</a>, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 shows that Google plans to implement a new multi-window experience. From the demonstration video, apps in full-screen now feature a navigation bar-style tab at the top. Tapping it produces a drop menu featuring the app&apos;s name and a few options: full-screen, split-screen, and freeform mode.</p><p>Split-screen functions like any other Android device. It places the app on half the display, giving users a chance to open another. Freeform mode lets users decide the window&apos;s size by dragging its rounded corners.</p><p>Moreover, testing showed that the apps gain a thick title bar featuring the app&apos;s name, a maximize button, and a close button. Tapping its name will produce the previously mentioned menu full of window options.</p><p>Rahman adds that users can drag a window in freeform mode to either side of the display to "snap it" into split-screen mode.</p><p>This desktop mode revamp is likely for Android 15; however, it&apos;s not clear exactly when it will roll out. The changes seem to make Android&apos;s OS seem a little more refined, but as Rahman noted, it still doesn&apos;t support keyboard shortcuts for window management or offer a polished launcher.</p>

<p>It seems that Google has been mulling over improving its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/with-pixel-8-google-may-finally-have-an-answer-to-samsung-dex">Android desktop mode</a> for a while, even during the early days of the Pixel 8. It was then discovered that the Pixel 8 series launched with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-8-series-apparently-supports-display-output">display output support</a>. Despite Google disabling its functionality on the software side, its hardware hid nothing, as users could attach a USB-C to HDMI cable to get things started.</p><p>The discovery was on functionality alone, as the Pixel 8 didn&apos;t showcase a <em>proper </em>desktop mode. The device&apos;s display was mirrored vertically onto a desktop monitor, but it was a positive sign of more to come — even more so now with the latest discovery.</p><p>These discoveries stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a>, which started rolling out on Monday (Apr. 1). The beta contains a host of bug fixes for some severe problems, and it features information about Google&apos;s continued development of Android 15&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-spaces-revamp-features-added">Private Spaces</a>." This feature would be a profile where users could download or lock previously installed apps behind.</p><p>Similar to Samsung&apos;s Secure Folder, users could safeguard sensitive data by locking certain apps behind a PIN or other password method.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is seemingly working on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-major-design-changes-status-bar-icons">status bar revamp</a> for Android 15. Haptic feedback could arrive for Quick Settings alongside a new battery icon.</p>

<p>As someone who used to downright avoid Samsung phones at all costs, I find it absolutely wild to see the turnaround that&apos;s happened. While the TouchWiz era still invokes a sense of cringe whenever I think about it, Samsung has managed to completely turn its software around, especially when it comes to updates.</p><p>In late March, Samsung started rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements">One UI 6.1</a>, including much more than a few bug fixes. Instead, this was <em>the</em> update to install for those using 2023 flagships, such as the Galaxy S23 or Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung brought many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI features</a> introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> to these older devices, with rumors that they could even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s22-galaxy-ai-support-potential">come to the Galaxy S22 series</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-flex-hinge-01.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in flex mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HLFPHPFELbhJrMTQGpgmjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>But that&apos;s not what surprised me the most about the rollout. It was the fact that every single device on the list got the update at around the same time. After seeing the news, I grabbed my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>, checked for an update, and sat back as both devices downloaded and installed their respective updates.</p><p>Not to mention that the Galaxy S24 received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-march-camera-update">separate update</a> at the same time, just with a focus on camera improvements, and Samsung&apos;s smartwatches also received updates, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a> series receiving a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-watch5-update/">improvements</a>.</p><p>This is the dream that we&apos;ve been hoping to see from Google, Samsung, and other OEMs. Whenever Apple releases a new update, most of the time, the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch all get an update simultaneously. However, we&apos;ve been dealing with staggered update releases on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> for years.</p><p>It definitely gives more credence to the idea that Samsung is morphing into the Apple of the Android space. Updates are all arriving together, new features are constantly arriving in one form or fashion, and the company is making efforts to provide a cohesive ecosystem. All the while, Google still seems to be falling a bit short of what we expect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-Google-Circle-to-Search-01.jpg" alt="Using Google Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8uq6C3DgSNoTTnwmaav7V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not to say Google is terrible with its updates. Sure, if it weren&apos;t for Google, Samsung&apos;s operating system would probably look a lot different than it does. After all, One UI is "just a skin" sitting atop the underlying Android platform. This obviously gives Samsung the ability to focus on improving One UI and implementing new APIs or features when Google adds them to Android (or even before Google can).</p><p>I can&apos;t help but feel as though Google is losing its grip a little, even though the company&apos;s phone division continues to see growth. The only evidence that you need is to see what happened with Gemini Nano. When initially introduced, a Google exec stated that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">Gemini Nano</a>-powered AI features were limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Many, myself included, wanted to know why the Pixel 8 wasn&apos;t going to be getting any of those features despite the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro largely sharing the same underlying hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QifomcUdXo2dssoKTPYYCL" name="pixel-8-21.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QifomcUdXo2dssoKTPYYCL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the time, Google explained that it was due to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-not-getting-gemini-nano">hardware limitations</a>." But again, that didn&apos;t make any sense, given the hardware that was shared between the two devices. Lo and behold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">Google eventually revealed</a> that Gemini Nano <em>will</em> come to the Pixel 8, albeit "as a developer option with the next Pixel Feature Drop," and even then, the announcement came much later. Meanwhile, Gemini Nano has already been available on the Galaxy S24 series, including the smallest model with 8GB or RAM.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-hope-google-doesnt-limit-assistant-with-bard">ongoing debacle</a> with the Pixel Fold, which is seeing none of the Gemini Nano features. That&apos;s a $1,800 phone that isn&apos;t capable of providing the same user experience as one that costs $1,100 less. It wasn&apos;t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/circle-to-search-will-roll-out-to-more-devices">until this week</a> that Google even brought the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature to the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, and that&apos;s not even to mention the delays seen with previous updates on Pixel models in recent years.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">doesn&apos;t exactly instill confidence</a> that Google will actually be able to follow through on its seven-year promise for software updates in any meaningful way if it can&apos;t fully commit to giving us the same features on current-gen hardware. Setting aside the differences between Tensor and Snapdragon, I&apos;m more confident with Samsung&apos;s ability to follow through than Google&apos;s. </p><p>While I do believe it was the right move by Google, I can&apos;t help but feel as though the difference between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24</a> in seven years will be night and day. Maybe I&apos;m wrong here, and I hope I am, but it&apos;s becoming more apparent that something is awry in Mountain View. </p><p>All of that is to say that I can&apos;t help but feel as though the software side of Google, you know, Android, feels a bit broken. This is a real shame, considering how great the hardware seems to be, even if it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">doesn&apos;t really hold up</a> after a couple of years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="52pxjwM2k3bG96uWEhuxxn" name="Google-Pixel-6-vs-pixel-6a-backs-angle-02.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 vs Pixel 6a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/52pxjwM2k3bG96uWEhuxxn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, it almost feels as though Google needs another "reset year," like we saw when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> was introduced. The company needs to get the hardware and software teams on a level playing field so that the ecosystem can continue to mature and grow without users running into limitations and delays.</p><p>If Google wants to continue to see growth and become a worthy alternative to Samsung and Apple, particularly in the U.S., something has to give. We&apos;ve dealt with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/genius-google-play-services">fragmentation</a> for years, but we&apos;ve reached the point of putting the blame on Google and not the OEMs. For a company worth so much money, it&apos;s really mind-boggling to see.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The great thing about Android phones and tablets is the convenient access to the most powerful search engine out there, Google Search. The Google Search widget does a lot more, such as offering one-tap access to Google Lens and voice search. To make accessing this even easier, nearly all phones these days come with the Google Search widget preinstalled on the home screen. On Pixel phones, this widget is baked into the Pixel launcher itself and cannot be removed even if you want to. </p><p>If you&apos;ve gone ahead and removed the widget from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> because perhaps it wasn&apos;t blending in with the theme or style of your phone&apos;s interface, we&apos;ll show you how you can easily customize the look of the Google Search widget with a few simple steps. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-google-search-widget-2">How to change the appearance of the Google Search widget</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>In case you don&apos;t already have the Search widget on your Android home screen, you can easily add it by pressing a long button on any empty space on the home screen and choosing <strong>Widgets </strong>from the bottom carousel. Simply scroll till you find the &apos;Search&apos; widget under Google. You can have more than one search widget too on different homescreens, if you want.<br>
<br>
The following steps were carried out on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-10-pro-review">OnePlus 10 Pro</a> running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, so some options could vary a little depending on your device or the version of Android you may have, but they should generally be the same.</p>
<p>1. Tap the colorful <strong>G logo</strong> in the left corner of the widget. This should bring up the Google Discover page. </p><p>2. Tap your <strong>profile photo</strong> in the top-right corner and then <strong>Settings </strong>at the bottom. </p><p>3. Scroll down till you find the sub-menu <strong>Search Widget</strong>. Tap it, and then tap <strong>Customize widget</strong>. </p><p>4. This will bring up a preview of your current widget against your device&apos;s wallpaper. All the options to customize it are at the bottom. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.43%;"><img id="GWuGuBjh9T4YF633ru6xJf" name="customize-google-search-widget-step-one.jpg" alt="Screenshots showing Google Search widget settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWuGuBjh9T4YF633ru6xJf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1429" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, you can go through any of the four options below to edit your Google Search widget to your liking and give it a whole new look. If at any point you want to revert all the changes, you can simply tap the Reset to Default Style option at the bottom of the Customize menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.53%;"><img id="KgG7sq3fayuCfs88v4SfHA" name="Google-Search-widget-customization.jpg" alt="Google search widget customization options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KgG7sq3fayuCfs88v4SfHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li>The first G menu lets you toggle between having just the letter "G" or "Google" appear in the widget. </li><li>The menu with the shapes icon lets you change the shape of the search box from the default pill shape to a rectangle, either with sharp or rounded corners. </li><li>The menu with the color palette icon really lets you have some fun. You can make the widget monochrome or darken the search box. The last option is a color picker, where you can choose any RGB shade and adjust the saturation. I like that when you choose a darker color, the color of the symbols in the widget automatically invert, so it's easier to see</li><li>The fourth menu gives you a slider to adjust the transparency of the widget, letting you go from translucent so you can see the wallpaper through the search box to a completely solid color.</li></ul>

<p>The Google Search widget is a powerful tool that is often overlooked by many users. It offers quick and easy access to Google search, rather than having to open Chrome and then do a search. Not only that, you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-plan-more-sustainable-vacation-google-search">plan an entire vacation using just Search</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-quickly-book-doctors-visit-google-search">book a doctor&apos;s appointment</a>.</p><p>Better yet, you get direct access to one of Google&apos;s most powerful tools right at your fingertips. The little camera logo in the widget brings up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a>, a visual search tool that lets you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-google-lens-search-images-text-simultaneously">search with text and images simultaneously</a>. It also lets you do live translation of any text you point your camera at, and you can choose the language you want it to translate to.</p><p>The microphone icon in the Search widget brings up Voice Search, which you can use to search by speaking into your device or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-assistant-identify-songs">identify songs</a> that you hear around you.</p><p>Now that you know how to customize the Google Search widget, you can use it more often. The best part is that every single Android phone or tablet can access this widget as it&apos;s built into the operating system. </p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is considering making some of its AI features in Search locked behind a subscription. </li><li>On feature, Search Generative Experience started as an experimental Search Labs feature but has since expanded to more users.</li><li>Google already offers premium features to subscribers through the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is hard at work developing artificial intelligence features, and some of them leverage the company&apos;s dominance in search. For example, Search Generative Experience (SGE) is an AI-based feature that creates summaries in response to user queries in Google Search from web results. Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">features like SGE are free</a>, but a new report from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4bfeb4-6579-4819-9f5f-b3a46ff59ed1" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> says that Google might not keep this model forever. It could make SGE or other AI features in Google Search a paid experience.</p><p>Google hasn&apos;t been shy about asking users to pay for advanced AI tools across its suite of services. Last year, the company introduced the Duet AI subscription service for business users in Google Workspace. (That subscription is now being rebranded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-business-enterprise-workspace-plans-may-launch-soon">Gemini for Workspace</a>.) Recently, Google started offering a consumer-level <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> subscription for features like Gemini Advanced. It&apos;s not that big of a leap for Google to want to bring other AI tools under its umbrella of subscriptions. </p><p>The Financial Times spoke to three people "with knowledge of [Google&apos;s] plans," who said that Google is considering adding the generative AI features in Search to its subscription services. While the report states Google is actively developing a system for subscription-based features, a decision has not been made yet.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google for a comment, and a spokesperson provided us with the following statement:</p><p>"For years, we&apos;ve been reinventing Search to help people access information in the way that’s most natural to them. With our generative AI experiments in Search, we’ve already served billions of queries, and we&apos;re seeing positive Search query growth in all of our major markets. We’re continuing to rapidly improve the product to serve new user needs. We’re not working on or considering an ad-free search experience.</p><p>As we&apos;ve done many times before, we&apos;ll continue to build new premium capabilities and services to enhance our subscription offerings across Google."</p><p>Regarding any potential plans, Google said it didn&apos;t have anything to announce at the moment. However, Google&apos;s statement does not rule out paid AI Search features sometime in the future. In fact, the company expressing its desire to enhance subscription offerings may indicate that Google is leaning toward the idea.</p>
