The beta releases gave us a preview of the features coming to Google&apos;s mobile OS, and with the beta program available on dozens of other devices in addition to Pixels, it&apos;s easy to get started with it right now. </p><p>Unlike the last two Android versions, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> has plenty of interesting additions, including a notification cooldown mode, better optimization, ability to record parts of the screen, audio sharing over Bluetooth, and a slate of upgrades around foldables. </p><p>So let&apos;s take a look at what phones will make the switch to Android 15, and when your device is likely to get the update.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google"><span>Google</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like previous years, the Android 15 update will hit Pixels ahead of every other device. If you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> or above, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a>. Obviously, Pixels will get the stable build on the day of release, and this gives Google&apos;s phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>That said, not all Pixels will upgrade to Android 15, with only the devices released in the last three years eligible to receive the build. Here&apos;s the list of Google devices that will get Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Pixel 6</li><li>Pixel 6 Pro</li><li>Pixel 6a</li><li>Pixel 7</li><li>Pixel 7 Pro</li><li>Pixel 7a</li><li>Pixel 8</li><li>Pixel 8 Pro</li><li>Pixel Fold</li><li>Pixel Tablet</li><li>Pixel 9</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro XL</li><li>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</li></ul>
<p>If you&apos;re interested and don&apos;t want to wait until the stable release hits, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">install the Android 15 beta</a> right now. The latest beta build doesn&apos;t have any major bugs, and is stable as a daily driver — I don&apos;t see any issues on my Pixel 8. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung"><span>Samsung</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-2024-phone-pile-7.jpg" alt="Galaxy S24 Ultra against other high-end Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhrhd5s7hMV6FCcDRVCnG5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung continues to be the largest phone manufacturer, and it releases more devices than any other phone brand. Samsung doesn&apos;t usually join the beta program at the same time as other manufacturers, instead opting to wait until it can roll out the next iteration of One UI. As the brand uses the stable Android 15 release as the base, that means you&apos;ll need to wait at least until mid-October to get your hands on the next version of Android on your Galaxy phone.</p><p>Samsung does a great job rolling out the stable update to its flagships in a timely manner, but its mid-range and budget phones don&apos;t get the same level of attention, so if you have a Galaxy A device, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 (or even Q2) 2025 to make the switch to Android 15.</p><p>These are the Samsung phones that should get the Android 15-based One UI 7 update:</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-s-series-2">Galaxy S series</h2>

<ul><li>Galaxy F14</li><li>Galaxy F15</li><li>Galaxy F34</li><li>Galaxy F54</li></ul>
<p>Samsung tends to prioritize its current devices over others, so it is likely that the beta update will be limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> series when it goes live. Select Galaxy A devices also got beta builds last year, and we&apos;ll have to wait and see if the Galaxy A55 joins the list this time around.</p><p>As always, the list is a tentative guideline based on Samsung&apos;s update guarantee; while all the devices mentioned above should receive Android 15, there&apos;s no telling if that will be the case until Samsung confirms it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus"><span>OnePlus</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K" name="oneplus-12-30.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 camera island next to OnePlus 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2UZcanyFQqZVSzA2Rz48K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus used to do a good job with updates, but it fumbled recent platform updates, leading to device-breaking bugs and lingering connectivity issues. And because the manufacturer uses ColorOS in all but name, it doesn&apos;t have much control over when it gets to roll out updates.</p><p>These OnePlus phones will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 10 Pro</li><li>OnePlus 10T</li><li>OnePlus 10R/10R 150W</li><li>OnePlus 11</li><li>OnePlus 11R</li><li>OnePlus 12</li><li>OnePlus 12R</li><li>OnePlus Open</li><li>OnePlus Nord 3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3</li><li>OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite</li></ul>
<p>OnePlus continues to just roll out a single update to its Nord N series of devices sold in North America, so even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">Nord N30</a> launched last year, it won&apos;t be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Considering how bad OnePlus was at delivering timely updates, I&apos;m not going to share any estimated timelines — this time, I&apos;ll wait until my devices get the stable Android 15 update before writing about it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-7-best-new-features-in-oneplus-oxygenos-14">OxygenOS 14</a> is in a decent state now, but that wasn&apos;t the case during the beta — or even the initial stable builds. So if you have a OnePlus phone, I&apos;d suggest waiting and seeing if the stable update has any issues before installing it.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo"><span>OPPO</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn" name="oppo-find-x7-ultra-27.jpg" alt="OPPO Find X7 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDJWVMS9US6s3p6RgQjCQn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO is doing a much better job with platform updates in general, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-flip-review">Find N2 Flip</a> picked up the stable Android 14 update before the end of 2023 — a sizeable achievement. With ColorOS 15 set to debut this year, it is likely we&apos;ll see a similar update cadence as last year.</p><p>OPPO guarantees four platform updates to its high-end phones, with its mid-range devices getting three updates. These are the OPPO phones that will get the Android 15-based ColorOS 15:</p>
<ul><li>OPPO Find X5</li><li>OPPO Find X5 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X6</li><li>OPPO Find X6 Pro</li><li>OPPO Find X7</li><li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra</li><li>OPPO Find N2</li><li>OPPO Find N3</li><li>OPPO Find N2 Flip</li><li>OPPO Find N3 Flip</li><li>OPPO Reno 9</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 9 Pro+</li><li>OPPO Reno 10</li><li>OPPO Reno 10 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11</li><li>OPPO Reno 11 Pro</li><li>OPPO Reno 11F</li><li>OPPO F25 Pro</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo"><span>Vivo</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8" name="vivo-x100-pro-22.jpg" alt="Vivo X100 Pro next to iQOO 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x3Fev8SEapidxjDpNT8jX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to OPPO, Vivo is delivering updates at a faster pace than previous years. And in Funtouch OS 14, the Chinese manufacturer has an interface that actually looks modern. Outside of that, Vivo continues to launch a lot of phones, with the V series getting a new model every six months.</p><p>As is the case with ColorOS, Vivo is unlikely to roll out an Android 15 build until Funtouch OS 15 is available, so devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a> won&apos;t be able to switch to Android 15 until early 2025. </p><p>That said, these are the Vivo phones that will be updated to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Vivo X80</li><li>Vivo X80 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro</li><li>Vivo X90 Pro+</li><li>Vivo X90s</li><li>Vivo X100</li><li>Vivo X100 Pro</li><li>Vivo X Fold</li><li>Vivo X Fold+</li><li>Vivo X Fold 2</li><li>Vivo X Flip</li><li>Vivo V27</li><li>Vivo V27 Pro</li><li>Vivo V27e</li><li>Vivo V29</li><li>Vivo V29 Pro</li><li>Vivo V29e</li><li>Vivo V30</li><li>Vivo V30 Pro</li><li>Vivo V40</li><li>Vivo V40 Pro</li></ul>
<p>As iQOO is basically a Vivo sub-brand, I&apos;m including its devices in the same list:</p>
<ul><li>iQOO 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10</li><li>iQOO 10 Pro</li><li>iQOO 10T</li><li>iQOO 11</li><li>iQOO 11 Pro</li><li>iQOO 12</li><li>iQOO Neo 7</li><li>iQOO Neo 7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 8</li><li>iQOO Neo 8 Pro</li><li>iQOO Neo 9</li><li>iQOO Neo 9 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7</li><li>iQOO Z7 Pro</li><li>iQOO Z7s</li><li>iQOO Z8x</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor"><span>Honor</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe" name="honor-magic-6-pro-5.jpg" alt="Honor Magic 6 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxMxtAgmaGqGU6jP9P2Ffe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is making a lot of progress in global markets, and the brand&apos;s ability to deliver standout devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> have allowed it to distinguish itself against its immediate rivals. While MagicOS 8.0 brings a lot of welcome additions, it still isn&apos;t quite as polished as other Chinese interfaces. Honor is instead leaning into AI, and it has a few unique features that are great to use.</p><p>Honor doesn&apos;t have a beta program as such, and the brand takes its time in rolling out stable updates to its devices. So if you have any of the phones listed below, you&apos;ll likely need to wait until Q1 2025 to get Android 15. With that out of the way, these are the Honor phones getting Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Honor Magic 5</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 5 Lite</li><li>Honor Magic 6</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro</li><li>Honor Magic 6 Pro RSR</li><li>Honor Magic Vs</li><li>Honor Magic V2</li><li>Honor Magic V2 RSR</li><li>Honor Magic V3</li><li>Honor 90</li><li>Honor 90 Pro</li><li>Honor 90 Lite</li><li>Honor X50</li><li>Honor X50 Pro</li><li>Honor X50 GT</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-asus"><span>ASUS</span></h2>
<p>ASUS continues to be obstinate when it comes to platform updates, and the brand only guarantees two Android OS updates even though its devices have powerful hardware. This is the biggest drawback of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, an otherwise great device that is hobbled by a shortsighted update policy.</p><p>Therefore, there are only six ASUS devices that will make the switch to Android 15, and three of those phones launched in 2024: </p>
<ul><li>ROG Phone 8</li><li>ROG Phone 8 Pro</li><li>ROG Phone 7</li><li>ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</li><li>Zenfone 10</li><li>Zenfone 11 Ultra</li></ul>

<p>Nothing is a relatively small brand, but it is doing the right things when it comes to software updates. All of the four devices in its portfolio — including the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> — will get three platform updates, and while it isn&apos;t quick to roll out updates, the fact that it is delivering the same update guarantee to its budget phone is a big deal.</p>
<ul><li>Nothing Phone 1</li><li>Nothing Phone 2</li><li>Nothing Phone 2a</li><li>Nothing Phone 2a Plus</li></ul>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi"><span>Xiaomi</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH" name="xiaomi14-ultra-27.jpg" alt="Xiaomi 14 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVsa5tGkkr9zRBkfVzgVoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most major phone manufacturers do a great job rolling out timely updates, but that still isn&apos;t the case with Xiaomi. In the last three years, Xiaomi phones were the last to receive platform updates, and I don&apos;t see that changing in 2024. Like its Chinese rivals, Xiaomi now guarantees four platform updates to its high-end and select mid-range phones, but it doesn&apos;t make any promises as to <em>when</em> it will roll out those updates.</p><p>This is frustrating if you&apos;re using a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>; the device has the best camera package available today, and while the software is fluid and has good customizability, I&apos;m unwilling to bet on the phone picking up Android 15 before the end of the year. As for the update itself, the Xiaomi 12 series and above will switch to Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>Xiaomi 12</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 12 Lite</li><li>Xiaomi 12S Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 13</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi 14</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14 Ultra</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 2</li><li>Xiaomi Mix Fold 3</li><li>Xiaomi 12T</li><li>Xiaomi 12T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 13T</li><li>Xiaomi 13T Pro</li><li>Xiaomi 14T</li><li>Xiaomi 14T Pro</li></ul>
<p>Redmi devices make up an overwhelming majority of Xiaomi&apos;s sales, but the brand uses an underhanded tactic where it doesn&apos;t launch these devices with the current version of Android. It&apos;s this strategy that makes it so hard to recommend a recent Redmi device; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12</a> series launched in Q1 2023 with Android 12 out of the box, six months after Android 13 became available. As such, these devices will not be updated to Android 15.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 series</a> debuted with Android 13 in February 2024, and this measure is to ensure that the devices don&apos;t get updated beyond Android 15. Therefore, the actual list of Redmi devices getting to Android 15 is a tiny minority:</p>
<ul><li>Redmi 12</li><li>Redmi Note 12 4G</li><li>Redmi Note 12R</li><li>Redmi Note 12T Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro</li><li>Redmi Note 13 Pro+</li><li>Redmi K70</li><li>Redmi K70 Pro</li><li>Redmi K70E</li></ul>
<p>POCO is in a similar situation, and last year&apos;s X5 and X5 Pro won&apos;t get Android 15. These are the POCO devices that will get MIUI 15 based on Android 15:</p>
<ul><li>POCO F5</li><li>POCO F5 Pro</li><li>POCO X6</li><li>POCO X6 Pro</li><li>POCO X6 Neo</li><li>POCO M6</li><li>POCO M6 Pro</li><li>POCO C65</li></ul>

<p>Motorola changed its update policy, and the brand now rolls out three platform updates to most of its phones. Of course, that&apos;s limited to select mid-range and flagship devices, with its entry-level phones only getting one update. Also, when those updates show up is an altogether different matter — the brand isn&apos;t anywhere as fast as its rivals at rolling out version updates.</p>

<p>As always, I&apos;m closely monitoring the progress of Android 15, and will share any details as and when brands officially announce them. Based on previous years, Samsung is likely to kickstart its beta program a few weeks after Google rolls out the stable release, and other brands will follow suit. </p><p>And as for the stable builds, the Pixels should switch over to Android 15 by mid-October, with recent estimates suggesting that&apos;s when Google will roll out the stable release. After that, I&apos;m estimating an eventual rollout by the end of Q4 to select flagships by Samsung, OPPO, Vivo, and OnePlus. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For the first time in a long, long while, Motorola has seemingly started a trend, and all the biggest names in the industry seem to have followed suit. While most smartphone makers appear to follow Apple or Samsung when deciding on the color palette of their new devices, everyone and their grandma seems to be following Motorola&apos;s blazing hot pink <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> these days.</p><p>A lot of people (including me) lost their minds when the first pink Pixel 9 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-leaks-in-pink-hands-on-video">spotted in the wild</a>, and we were even more excited when the matching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> made its debut next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series. Any time you spot a pink Pixel, you immediately know that it&apos;s a 9 series Pixel because of the shade alone.</p><p>The boldest new color variant in any smartphone lineup sets the mood for that launch, eventually becoming the signifier for that series. For example, the Kinda Coral <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> was a brave new hue and it ended up becoming the signature shade for Pixels of that era.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z5GEEg9KEDLvj59JCdwdXQ" name="pink-android-phones-collage-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Collage of various pink Android phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5GEEg9KEDLvj59JCdwdXQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And guess what? Apple just released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16 series</a>, and sure enough, there&apos;s a pink option that we can buy. We&apos;re not talking about Apple&apos;s usual subtle or rose gold hues, the iPhone 16 is unapologetically, irrevocably, very loudly and proudly pink. I don&apos;t know about you, but I wasn&apos;t shocked at all.</p><p>Before Google and Apple, though, Samsung brought pastel pink to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. Even HMD, the owner of Nokia, has joined in on the fun with the blushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a>. But despite all these big brands jumping on the pink phone bandwagon, none of them started the trend. The credit for that, in my eyes, goes to Motorola.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong—pink phones existed before the Razr Plus 2024. Samsung launched the S21 series and the Z Flip 5 in pastel pinks. But Motorola&apos;s story with the shade goes way back and is far more iconic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PjXi38jD3Zt9kLQ5fjYvEK" name="iphone-16-pink-and-ultramarine.jpg" alt="Two iPhone 16 units in pink and ultramarine held in two hands." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PjXi38jD3Zt9kLQ5fjYvEK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Jacob Krol)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Turn the clock back to the early 2000s, when Motorola was at the top of its game. Every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">modern-day foldable</a> has the original Razr flip phone to thank for its existence. The Razr was the coolest phone on the block back in the day. It became even more iconic when reality TV star Paris Hilton became the poster girl for the Razr, rocking one in a hot pink shade.</p><p>Fast forward to today, 20 years after the RAZR V3, and Motorola has come full circle. The brand invited Paris Hilton to don a hot pink Razr once more to honor the legendary flip phone that started it all. Hilton was a key figure at the Razr Plus 2024 launch event, inviting waves of nostalgia for so many of us.</p><p>The Razr 5G came in a subtle Blush Gold option, followed by a deep Viva Magenta offering for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>. But while this isn&apos;t Motorola&apos;s first pink foldable, the Razr Plus 2024 is the first <em>proper</em> pink foldable, and I think it&apos;s the perfect time to reintroduce this iconic coat of paint. With the launch of the Razr Plus 2024, Motorola has overtaken Samsung to reprise its role as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-foldable-phone">best flip phone</a> maker in the biz. I couldn&apos;t imagine anything better than this to encapsulate the meaning of a hot pink Razr.</p>

<p>I was curious to hear Motorola&apos;s side of this color story, so I reached out to them. Here&apos;s what Maria Jose Martin, director of North America Marketing at Motorola, had to say about the significance of a hot pink Razr.</p><p>"The original RAZR V3 established pink as a fashionable and desirable colorway for smartphones, and has since then always been closely associated with Motorola and the Razr," she commented, talking about the inception of the pink Razr. "This year, 20 years after the original Razr launch, we were incredibly excited to bring back the Razr in all of its iconic hot pink glory — alongside Paris Hilton, of course!"</p><p>Sharing some insight on Motorola&apos;s inspiration behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">Razr 2024 Plus color options</a>, this rather loud pink colorway, and the decision to bring the iconic hue back now, she said that smartphones are more than just tech these days; they’re vessels for self-expression.</p><p>The brand aimed to establish an emotional connection with consumers and felt that hot pink would naturally be associated with the original Razr. This bold and trendy color choice also offers users an opportunity to express their individuality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These days, smartphones are more than just tech, they’re vessels for self-expression.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When asked about the color and how it connects to the roots of the Razr lineup, Martin went on to give a very in-depth response.</p><p>"The original RAZR V3 was one of the first devices to become a cultural icon. In the early 2000s, having a Razr was a fashion statement, and a status symbol for the era&apos;s top celebrities and &apos;cool kids.&apos; However, the device was never just an accessory - it brought technological innovations of its time and truly bridged the gap between fashion and technology."</p><p>I love the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">Motorola is aware of the nostalgia factor</a>. In its own way, the brand is paying homage to its older fans, while attracting a whole new generation of users with more vivacious color options. It is a lovely sentiment and I hope that Motorola continues to dance to the beat of its own drum.</p>

The phone had an incredible set of cameras with unique tuning, a gorgeous design, and reliable hardware. The P30 Pro positioned Huawei as a leading Android manufacturer, and it felt like the brand was poised for great things.</p><p>Of course, the U.S. trade ban effectively put a halt to that, and while Huawei is still delivering great phones — the Pura 70 Ultra is a terrific showcase, and the insane tri-fold design is quintessential Huawei — the restrictions have hobbled the brand&apos;s global progress.</p>

<p>This is where Honor comes in. The brand started out in 2013 as a Huawei sub-brand aimed at a younger audience — much like POCO is to Xiaomi — and it picked up a sizeable market share thanks to its budget-focused designs. Honor was similarly affected by the U.S. ban, but it split away from Huawei at the end of 2020, and is now controlled by a Chinese consortium.</p><p>The split allowed Honor access to Google services once again, and it used that to good effect, swiftly rising up the ranks in the intervening three years and making decent inroads outside China, a sizeable achievement considering it doesn&apos;t have access to Huawei&apos;s marketing might any longer. While Honor focused on budget devices under Huawei, it is now squarely positioned at the premium segment, and more importantly, it is delivering exciting designs that stand out from the pack.</p><p>Chinese brands consistently push the boundaries of hardware design, whether that&apos;s retractable camera modules, phones with screens mounted on sliding rails — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-xiaomi-mi-mix-3-us">Xiaomi Mi Mix 3</a> — or foldables. Yes, Samsung beat its Chinese rivals by debuting foldables ahead of everyone else, but all the best innovations in this area are coming from Chinese manufacturers.</p>

<p>Whether it&apos;s Vivo with an ultra-sleek design and dual fingerprint sensors housed inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a>, or the insane <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">tri-fold design that Huawei just introduced</a>, there hasn&apos;t been any shortage of innovative ideas of late. The most exciting foldable I used this year is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a>; it is even thinner than last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>, and the design removes a lot of the pain points associated with foldables — the device is just as thin and light as a regular phone.</p><p>Honor has one of the strongest camera packages on a foldable, the best battery life, and the best displays. The manufacturer&apos;s efforts with PWM dimming and ensuring its devices have flicker-free panels give it a sizeable advantage, and the Magic V3&apos;s Defocus Display is terrific — as my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Nick Sutrich pointed out</a>.</p><p>It isn&apos;t just foldables either; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a> continues to be one of the best phones around, and the recently-unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">MagicPad 2 tablet</a> brings an OLED panel to the mid-range segment. Honor&apos;s strategy to focus on premium devices is an outlier; most Chinese brands turn to the budget segment to build overseas market share, and it&apos;s good to see Honor not going down that route. </p>

<p>The biggest criticism I can level at Honor is the software; MagicOS needs a visual refresh, as it still has legacy EMUI underpinnings. The recent MagicOS 8.0.1 build shows positive signs in this area, with Honor turning to a slew of AI-assisted features to differentiate its software and teaming up with Google. I&apos;m ambivalent towards generative AI, but a lot of the features available on the Magic V3 are actually usable and not just gimmicky, and that in itself is a big deal.</p><p>Honor is doing a terrific job taking on Huawei&apos;s mantle in the high-end segment, and I can&apos;t wait to see what the brand has in store for 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest AI model is preparing to slide into Assistant&apos;s turf and do more for you when you&apos;re working or on the go.</p><p>The company started sending emails out to Pixel Buds owners this week, highlighting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini&apos;s</a> upcoming addition to the earbuds (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/25/google-gemini-is-coming-to-all-pixel-buds/">9to5Google</a>). Android Central has also received this email, which states users can leverage Gemini&apos;s assistance if it&apos;s been set as the "default" helper on their phone. Google warns that some features "may work differently" if Gemini is chosen over the Assistant.</p><p>Moreover, Google states, "Your Android phone needs to be unlocked and connected to your Pixel Buds while you’re wearing them." The email adds that this prevents the necessity of constantly unlocking your phone whenever you want to talk to Gemini. Additionally, if your buds are disconnected from your phone, you will lose Gemini&apos;s hands-free assistance.</p><p>Users can get around that by altering the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7685360?utm_source=msa&utm_campaign=GS204129&utm_medium=email_service&utm_content=110854178&utm_term=oneunlock">Only Require One Unlock</a>" option in your Pixel Buds&apos; assistant settings. What&apos;s more, Google states Gemini does not recognize the "On Headphones" option in the "Personal results" settings. However, the standard Google Assistant will still adhere to that setting.</p><p>The company is also changing how the "Hey Google" command will work for the Pixel Buds. Google states your "Hey Google" settings on your phone will now control whether the AI can assist you via your Pixel Buds. This will reportedly affect Gemini alongside the regular Assistant.</p><p>The publication states the updates bringing Gemini and "Hey Google" command changes involve the Pixel Buds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">Pixel Buds Pro</a>, and the Pixel Buds A-series.</p>

<p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> in August and those tiny devices feature a rich integration with Gemini. Shifting the rest of the Pixel Buds lineup toward Gemini seems like an expected approach — especially since it&apos;s been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features">moving in on the Assistant everywhere else</a>.</p><p>In other news, the notification capabilities of the original Pixel Buds Pro went through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/pixel-buds-pro-assistant-notifications-gone">some turbulent times</a> recently, as detailed by user reports. Users attempting to have the Assistant read out their notifications were met with an error and a lack of audible information. This was concerning the device&apos;s touch-and-hold capability.</p><p>The Assistant informed users that they would need to say "Hey Google, read notifications" aloud if they needed such information. After questioning, Google confirmed to Android Central that the change would remain as it was done based on user feedback. The press-and-hold function will no longer work, but it now seems like the change was in light of bigger plans.</p>

<p>Amazfit has permanently discounted the Helio Ring to $199 and made its two hidden subscriptions free to all new and existing Helio Ring owners, eliminating one of our biggest complaints about the smart ring.</p><p>Amazfit claimed at launch that the Helio Ring had "no subscriptions required," which we called "disingenous" in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Amazfit Helio Ring review </a>because certain sleep insights, fitness summaries, and chatbot conversations did require expensive subscriptions. </p><p>"We heard the feedback and are now offering all of the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness features to new and existing ring users for free, for life," an Amazfit rep told us on Thursday.</p><p>Zepp Aura will assess possible issues like sleep apnea, insomnia, and general sleepiness while analyzing your Helio Ring sleep data, as well as offer wellness coaching and an "AI audio engine" that plays relaxing music through your phone for better sleep. The Zepp Fitness sub lets you see in-depth weekly or monthly Fitness Reports and a fitness-focused chatbot to help you with your training.</p><p>Combined, the Zepp Aura and Zepp Fitness subs cost $100/year with annual passes, more than the $70 annual fee for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Oura Ring Gen 3</a> membership. Now, Helio Ring owners will get these tools for free.</p><p>We&apos;ve asked Amazfit if Helio Ring owners who previously subscribed to Zepp Aura or Fitness will get a refund or rebate, and we will update this post if we hear back.</p>

<p>Compared to the Oura Ring ($300–550 + $6/month subscription), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> ($399), the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring</a> ($299), and most other smart rings we&apos;ve tested, the Amazfit Helio Ring ($199) is now significantly more affordable. It still has other issues like short battery life and limited ring size options, but they&apos;re easier to swallow at this price point.</p><p>Amazfit also announced that it&apos;ll launch the new version of its Zepp app on October 14, available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazfit-smartwatch">Amazfit watch</a> and ring owners. It&apos;ll have "an entirely new and improved redesign," along with new features like a workout exertion score, a health monitoring section, and a food camera diary.</p><p>Specific to health monitoring, the Zepp app will lump together key stats like physical/mental recovery, RHR, HRV, deep sleep total, exertion load, and training status and warn you which stats "need attention." If everything is where it should be, the Health Monitor will say you&apos;re "Within Range" in the main Today view.</p><p>The lower price, combined with this Zepp app revamp, have us more optimistic about the Amazfit Helio Ring as a budget smart ring option, even if plenty of people will pay extra for other brands.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed a few updates preparing to arrive for Google Maps, like an expansion of Street View and sharper satellite imagery thanks to AI.</li><li>Google Maps users will find improved Street View imagery for nearly 80 countries.</li><li>Those in Google Earth on the web will soon experience "historical imagery," which lets users go back roughly 80 years to see how the planet and cities have changed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing a few updates for Google Maps and Google Earth that may help users understand the ever-changing world.</p><p>Kicking off the changes is an update to Street View on Google Maps. The company detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/earth/3-imagery-updates-to-google-earth-and-maps/">Keyword post</a> that users can expect to find "new imagery" in nearly 80 countries. This expansion in Google Maps brings better virtual adventures to places like Bosnia, Nambia, Liechtenstein, Paraguay, and more.</p><p>The company&apos;s cars and trekkers were stated to utilize a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/street-view-15-new-features/">new camera technology</a>, which it first revealed in 2022. With the ability to mount on any vehicle, Google states it&apos;s made creating better Street View imagery a breeze in more places. The company will continue to update Maps&apos; Street View for better virtual insight into countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and more.</p><p>The Street View expansion launched on September 25, meaning users should keep their eyes peeled.</p><p>Google&apos;s update also focuses on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-google-earth-whats-difference">Google Earth</a>. The company states its users will soon have an easier time turning back the clock on a portion of the planet. A new "historical imagery" feature will soon become available on Google Earth&apos;s web version.</p><p>Users will find around 80 years of stored "satellite and aerial imagery" of the planet&apos;s geography to understand the changes it experienced. While 80 years ago from 2024 pits us in the 1940s, Google states some places will send you back to the 30s — like London, Berlin, or Paris.</p><p>Alongside this update for users, Google states researchers and companies will soon gain custom map creation. Projects will also be displayed directly on the Google Earth homepage to improve collaboration efforts.</p>

<p>Lastly, images viewed in Google Maps and Earth will benefit from sharper quality, courtesy of AI. The post states users can expect to see sharper imagery in both apps "this week" due to its Cloud Score Plus AI. The software can better recognize clouds, mist, fog, and haze while keeping the earth&apos;s weather patterns consistent.</p><p>Over the summer, Google rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-ui-overhaul-stable-rollout">a major U overhaul for Android</a> users that brought a "sheet-based" style. This new style gives users more agency over the information they see on their display to ensure they don&apos;t miss what&apos;s important. Of course, Google plans to plug more AI into Maps to assist with finding locations with pre-made questions and the option to write your own.</p><p>Other updates like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wildfire-alerts-europe-africa-expansion">wildfire alerts</a> arrived in July for Maps and Search. The feature piggybacks off satellites and Google&apos;s AI models to display the range and intensity of a wildfire so users can get to safety in time.</p>

<ul><li>The Google TV Streamer, a $99 set-top box, doesn't come with a high-speed HDMI cable in the box. </li><li>Although this practice isn't unusual, it is a stark difference from the Chromecast with Google TV it replaces, which featured a built-in USB-C cable. </li><li>Google is offering $10 off an HDMI cable to TV Streamer buyers, which gets you an HDMI 2b cable.</li><li>Unfortunately, this deal seems to be limited to people who pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer and previously owned a Chromecast. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Product boxes are shrinking, and it&apos;s not just because of eco-friendly packaging. We&apos;re also getting less in the box with each and every release. The days of a smartphone including a case, earbuds, and chargers are long gone. We&apos;re lucky to get a cable or two, and if you pre-ordered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer</a>, you&apos;ll get exactly one cable: a USB-A to USB-C cord. </p><p>Google also throws in a USB-A power adapter, two AAA batteries, and a Voice Remote to get you started. However, the Google TV Streamer is missing one thing in the box, and it&apos;s required to connect the set-top box. That&apos;s the HDMI cable, which you&apos;ll need to purchase separately if you don&apos;t have one lying around. </p><p>There&apos;s a good chance Google TV Streamer buyers don&apos;t have an HDMI cable handy, for a few reasons. TVs usually come with an HDMI cable or two, but if that&apos;s used up by a cable box or another media player, you&apos;re out of luck. Users that were accustomed to the streaming stick lifestyle, using products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-chromecast-google-tv-its-first-tv-stick-years">Chromecast with Google TV</a> or the Fire TV Stick, will miss their built-in HDMI cable. </p><p>The reason we always get from tech companies as to why we don&apos;t need new cables, earbuds, or power adapters in the box with products is that we already own them. Adding new ones would just create e-waste, and that&apos;s a fair point in some situations. But in the case of the Google TV Streamer, it doesn&apos;t make sense. You don&apos;t want to pick up any old HDMI cable with this streaming box, because it supports HDMI 2.1. Using a random HDMI cable that came with a TV or console would be wasting the performance of the $99 TV Streamer. </p>

<p>Google seems to be aware of the potential problems, because as of this week, it&apos;s offering a discount to select TV Streamer buyers for an HDMI cable on the Google Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/24/google-tv-streamer-hdmi-cable/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The HDMI 2b cable available on the store costs $10, and with a $10 off coupon, you can buy one for just $10. That&apos;s probably more than you&apos;d pay for a basic HDMI cable at your local Best Buy, but it&apos;s also HDMI 2b, so it can maximize your Google TV Streamer&apos;s performance. </p><p>Consumers pay for everything in the box, <em>including the box</em>, when they buy a product. That&apos;s why offering a discount toward needed cables or accessories isn&apos;t such a bad idea. Sure, it&apos;s annoying to have to buy a required HDMI cable separately, but would you prefer Google sell the TV Streamer for $110 and give a cable to everyone? This way, users who already have an HDMI 2.1 cable or want to buy their own aren&apos;t paying for something they don&apos;t need (and creating e-waste).</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t look like this is a standing promotion. Here&apos;s what people who pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer received in an email this week: "Take $10 off a Google HDMI cable. It’s perfect for your Google TV Streamer," it says. "Because you recently pre-ordered the Google TV Streamer, we’re giving you a discount on the new Google Ultra High­-Speed HDMI Cable. Thanks for being with us since the Chromecast days." </p><p>There could be two qualifiers to unlocking this promotion: pre-ordering the TV Streamer <em>and</em> owning a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Chromecast</a> device in the past. It also expires at the end of November. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR" name="iphone-15-pro-max-usb-c.jpg" alt="A USB-C cable and an iPhone 15 Pro Max on a wooden table, showcasing the iPhone's USB Type-C port." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziXkZUAr5KCbBjhiciF5RR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s cable credit may be the closest a big tech company has gotten to solving the cable problem. This should&apos;ve been a standing promotion that allowed any Google TV Streamer buyer to add an HDMI cable to their purchase for an extra $10. Some people would surely take their TV Streamer at the $99 price point and use their own cord, but many who need an HDMI 2.1b cable surely would&apos;ve taken Google up on its offer. </p><p>Now, it&apos;s more likely that someone buys a Google TV Streamer, realizes they need an HDMI cable, and buys a cheap one for a few bucks at a big box store. This doesn&apos;t benefit Google or the user, because the buyer gets a worse experience by not using the right specification of HDMI cable. They could be less likely to buy another Google TV product or recommend one to a friend. </p><p>Surprisingly, I think tech companies could look to an unlikely company for a solution to the growing cable problem: Otterbox. The longtime rugged case brand had a history of shipping select cases with holsters, so you could mount them on your hip. However, they weren&apos;t used by everyone, and I personally had a tendency to toss them aside without much thought. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NnaRmkmDG4azFjQ8MkgcFT" name="Otterbox-Holster.jpg" alt="An otterbox defender series xt holster against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NnaRmkmDG4azFjQ8MkgcFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Otterbox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, Otterbox doesn&apos;t ship Defender Series XT or Defender Series Pro XT cases with holsters in the box. Not everyone needs or wants one. However, buyers of either of those cases can redeem a free holster with a code that comes in the box. Otterbox found a way to reduce costs and wastes without the consumer losing out. Anyone who wants a case holster can absolutely still get one with their case, completely free.</p><p>Google, Samsung, Apple, and every other tech company could learn from this approach. I don&apos;t fault these brands from not including cables in the box by default for a variety of reasons. With that being said, some people do need a cable, and those who do should be able to get one for free, or at the very least at a discount. </p>

<p>Samsung&apos;s next big flagship is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is more than a few months from its launch. However, that hasn&apos;t stopped the device from appearing on benchmark sites, and the latest one reveals some interesting parameters alongside the details about the upcoming Snapdragon flagship chipset.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra bearing <strong>SM-S938B</strong> and <strong>SM-S938U</strong> models has hit the latest Geekbench, revealing its single- and multi-core scores. The test results were shared by Ice Universe and Tarun Vats, two prominent tipsters on X.</p>

<p>Both indicate scoring more than 3,000 for single-core performance and around 9,700 for multi-core. The leaked benchmark further indicates that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and equipped with 12GB of RAM.</p><p>The other interesting element from the benchmark test is, however, the upcoming Qualcomm chipset, which is all set to be unveiled at Snapdragon Summit next month.</p>

<p>It is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 — the octa-core chip with two powerful cores featuring whopping clock speeds of 4.47GHz and another six cores with 3.53GHz clock speeds. These speeds are for the SM-S938B Galaxy S25 Ultra. On the other hand, the SM-S938U features slightly similar clock speeds, rocking at 4.19GHz and 2.90GHz, respectively. </p><p>The impressive Geekbench score isn&apos;t just limited to the Galaxy S25 Ultra; earlier this month, the same chipset was witnessed on a OnePlus phone, likely the OnePlus 13 — also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">on a Geekbench test</a>. It also scored significant single and multi scores, 3,236 and 10,049, a noticeable bump over the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> scored 2,308 / 7,283 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> scored 943 / 4,859 in their respective Future Labs Geekbench 6.2 tests this year, each using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. So the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 looks to be a significant power boost.</p>
<p>Thanks to this Samsung benchmark, we know that Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will be a promising addition this year — thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs-leak">new Oryon CPUs</a>, which are being implemented for the first time.</p><p>Earlier this month, prominent leaker OnLeaks produced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">Galaxy S25 Ultra renders</a> that indicated a significant design change, including flatter sides over the predecessor and cameras similar to those of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, including a 200MP main camera. Now that we have the Snapdragon benchmark and RAM, the picture of what to expect from the Galaxy S25 Ultra is becoming much clearer.</p>

I couldn&apos;t envision a way for it to be the centerpiece for a game the way virtual reality is, which can transport you to somewhere new and give you completely bespoke experiences.</p>

<p>Starship Home changed my point of view. The moment the walls of my living room became windows on a spaceship, I was hooked. The feeling of looking out into space was as palpable as looking out a real window. Opening the in-floor storage container felt like it came from my basement, and letting things into the ship via the airlock evoked the real feeling of potential danger that comes with such a task.</p><p>This effect was so convincing that when I took off my headset, I kept expecting to see the starship&apos;s components on the wall where they were in the game.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kYJpDPfEcCn4qGHPVJGrJg" name="starship-home-art.jpg" alt="Starship Home logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kYJpDPfEcCn4qGHPVJGrJg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Quest 3 debuted, Meta and several other developers released short mixed-reality games that helped showcase how convincing mixed-reality could be. Of course, the problem with these is that they&apos;re short, so even the best experiences end in just a few minutes.</p><p>That&apos;s what makes Starship Home so special. It&apos;s a 4-6 hour adventure, depending on how long you take to discover everything, which is exponentially longer than most other games that rely entirely on mixed reality.</p><p>The game begins and ends in exactly the same place: whatever room you&apos;re playing in. At the start, you receive a package from what&apos;s clearly a galactic Amazon, bringing you an entire starship in one big, giant box.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe" name="starship-home-gameplay.gif" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of Starship Home as played on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuQMC9PZNvAXowaEwqrjYe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="180" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This clever intro kicks off the setup portion of the game, allowing you to place portholes, windows, the terrarium, storage depot, airlock, and, finally, the helm of the ship. Each of these pieces snaps believably to the walls of your room, except for the storage depot and the projector, which both reside somewhere on the floor.</p><p>Looking through portholes and windows is incredibly convincing in every way. The glass subtly refracts the view of the outside, and you can get up close and see around the edges of space as you might expect to be able to in a real spaceship.</p><p>The concept is quickly kicked off as an alien appears on the helm’s display, informing you that this is actually his spaceship, but Amazon brought it to the wrong planet, so you&apos;ll have to take it off and bring it back to him ASAP. What follows is an impressive trip through hyperspace, beginning with grabbing an energy crystal from the in-ground storage depot, sliding it into the fuel tube, choosing the destination from the projector, and, finally, pushing the hyperspace lever forward to engage engines.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XqbTxoD7XcZuGYRx63thkM" name="starship-home-screenshot-01.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqbTxoD7XcZuGYRx63thkM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During this entire exchange, you have a full view of your room, ensuring that everything around you begins to blend in with the objects in the game. During hyperspace, your entire room will change color, glowing convincingly from the hyperspace tunnel light emitted from space.</p><p>More than once, after I was done playing, I&apos;d take off the headset and expect the windows and portholes to still be on the wall. It was a fascinating effect that reminded me of the dreams I used to have when I first tried VR many years ago.</p><p>As the planet comes into view, you quickly realize something&apos;s wrong. No, hostile aliens aren&apos;t there to abduct you or anything. Rather, the friendly alien reveals that his planet is covered in a deadly blight that will soon erase their existence if something isn&apos;t done to stop it, revealing the real plot of the game.</p>
<h2 id="a-plot-that-fills-the-gaps-2">A plot that fills the gaps</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zj6jagxFtB44AWB5S7H9PM" name="starship-home-screenshot-05.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zj6jagxFtB44AWB5S7H9PM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you venture forth toward other planets in search of a cure — namely, other plants that are blight-resistant — you&apos;re met with the most interesting flora you&apos;ll likely ever encounter. But it&apos;s not enough that these plants have eyes and can freely move. They also have dreams that you can explore with the help of a unique machine introduced on the second planet.</p><p>Each plant you acquire has its own unique dreams, all of which are presented in the form of a puzzle or mini-game. Dreams change the room around you in a psychedelic way, sometimes changing the color of the room while other times might remove the ceiling entirely. One game had me bouncing a plant&apos;s tears on floating platforms, while another had me hitting balloons into the sky, keeping them along long enough for them to grow into floating islands.</p><p>Each is creative and unique, drawing from a wide range of play styles that feel purpose-built.</p><p>All of these interactions were made better by the close attention the team paid to controller haptics. Few games do it this well, and it&apos;s wonderful to feel the difference between a gentle vibration while petting plants and a more solid one when pulling open the storage container, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ebdu66XN6Mavumaa6w26BM" name="starship-home-screenshot-04.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ebdu66XN6Mavumaa6w26BM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, in all of this, your physical room is visible. I assumed this would get boring after a while but was pleasantly surprised when it still felt new and fresh after four or five hours.</p><p>It&apos;s proof to me that mixed reality gaming can be more than a way to safely see the room around you. It&apos;s a fantastic way to get you used to a future where we wear AR glasses exist and these types of games and encounters can happen more organically. As I wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/virtual-pets-in-the-era-of-ai">previous thVRsday article</a>, a future where we have a virtual pet that comes along for the ride with us is a very real possibility, and I can now see that extend to the plants and other objects around us.</p><p>The sense of palpability of each of the virtual objects in my room while playing Starship Home was surreal. It&apos;s funny how something that doesn&apos;t actually exist can feel so real. The feeling is more than a fleeting memory of a vivid dream. It&apos;s an expectation that I can go back to the place on command and experience them whenever I want.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DqqiNGYYZLNTZiFauEUu7N" name="starship-home-screenshot-03.jpg" alt="Mixed reality screenshots of Starship Home on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DqqiNGYYZLNTZiFauEUu7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creature)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I once thought that having virtual objects fill bare walls sounded kind of sad. But after experiencing Starship Home and realizing how authentic they could feel, I can&apos;t wait for the future of shared virtual spaces just like this. I can imagine coming into a room that&apos;s been seasonally decorated in something new without having to go down to the nearest Hobby Lobby to drop a bunch of money for it.</p><p>That future is still a ways off, and while I think there&apos;s a distinct possibility that we&apos;ll see another great full mixed-reality game come along before too long, the concept isn&apos;t as easy to work with as a full VR game. Plenty of Quest 3 games use the concept to enhance the experience — like Demeo putting the game board on a table for a bunch of people to play in the same room — but Starship Home’s concept is a unique one that won&apos;t be quickly replicated in another brilliant way overnight.</p><p>Still, I can&apos;t wait to see what some other brilliant developer comes up with, especially now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest 3S</a> is making full-quality mixed reality more affordable for everyone.</p>
