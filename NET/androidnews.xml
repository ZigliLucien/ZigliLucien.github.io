<p>Nubia has unveiled the Nova, a fresh addition to the RedMagic lineup. Unlike earlier models, this is a gaming tablet that aims to take over your gaming needs on the go, featuring an overclocked Snapdragon chipset and an RGB fan.</p><p>The RedMagic Nova is set to make its global debut on September 27, following its successful domestic launch in China.</p><p>At the heart of the flagship tablet lies a souped-up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm 8 Gen 3</a> chip, featuring an overclocked Cortex-X4 Prime core that reaches a 3.4GHz clock speed. With up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, you’ve got a tablet that flexes harder than your entire gaming rig, leaving the rest of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-gaming-tablets">favorite gaming tablets</a> in the dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.96%;"><img id="jWEaFmtVtUGovnGTiQ6PCU" name="RedMagic-nova-gaming-tablet-black-and-white.jpg" alt="Redmagic Nova in black and white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWEaFmtVtUGovnGTiQ6PCU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2141" height="1605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RedMagic Nova’s 10.9-inch display is basically a visual feast with its 2K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, so you’ll never see a stutter in your games. Gravity X2.0 and Redmagic’s Cube AI keep things running at top speed, while the 10,100mAh battery means you can game until your thumbs give out.</p><p>Moreover, the RedMagic Nova promises a killer battery life of up to 19 hours, giving you around 10 hours of non-stop gaming on a single charge. Plus, it’s got 120W flash charging, juicing up to 50% in just 15 minutes and a full charge in only 45 minutes, according to Nubia.</p><p>But the real game-changer is the 840Hz instant sampling rate. Tablets are usually a bit sluggish with touch input, but this one registers your moves almost instantly. So, you can nail those rapid jumps and shots without turning your expensive tablet into a stress ball.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="nwN2FY6QuZDTvobvKdS2wX" name="RedMagic-nova-gaming-tablet-RGB-fan.jpg" alt="RedMagic Nova cooling system" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwN2FY6QuZDTvobvKdS2wX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9000" height="6000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To keep your tablet from heating up during gaming marathons, Nubia has thrown in a 20,000 RPM fan, a 3D heat pipe, and fancy internal air ducts. Plus, it’s decked out with a 9,268 superconducting copper foil, a 29,400mm under-screen cooling alloy, and an 89,114m aluminum body that supposedly slashes core temps by 25°C—Nubia’s numbers, not ours. And there’s thermal conductive gel to top it all off.</p><p>The RedMagic Nova also flaunts a transparent glass panel made from lens-grade aluminum silicon, plus an aviation aluminum body and a sleek middle frame. It’s got a 45-degree anti-slip edge and an anodized back cover that adds to the look, while the RGB lights and ergonomic design make for a visually striking and comfy gaming experience.</p><p>On the software front, the gaming tablet comes with a custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> skin packed with AI tricks to make your gaming life easier. The USB-C port lets you beam the display to larger screens or VR headsets in 4K. It’s also got a proper desktop mode, not just lame screen-sharing, and it plays nice with popular controllers.</p>

<p>The device boasts a 50MP rear camera and a 20MP front-facing selfie snapper. Meanwhile, the 3D Explorer Edition rocks 13MP dual rear and 8MP dual front cameras. For audio, both models come with 4-channel speakers.</p><p>U.S. pricing and availability will be announced on September 27, but Nubia has already dropped the Chinese prices for the RedMagic Nova. It starts at ¥3,999 (approximately $565) for the 12GB+256GB model and climbs to ¥5,599 (around $790) for the 24GB+1TB configuration.</p>

<ul><li>Motorola has passed a new device through the HDR10+ certification database, which seems to be a new foldable dubbed the "Razr 50s."</li><li>Due to the listing, it seems the phone will support HDR10+ for its display, but any additional specifications weren't listed.</li><li>Motorola launched the Razr Plus 2024 and the base Razr 2024 this summer and the former provides a large, immersive 4-inch pOLED cover display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Motorola has already launched two new foldables this year, but a discovery suggests there&apos;s another on the way.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/motorola-razr-50s-hdr10plus-certification/">MySmartPrice</a>, Motorola is passing another foldable through the certification hoops dubbed the "Razr 50s." The phone was reportedly spotted moving through the HDR10+ certification database, likely indicating its support for a 10-bit color display.</p><p>The most curious aspect of this new device is the "S" moniker attached to the number. Rumors suggest this could signify a shift in Motorola&apos;s targeted market. There&apos;s a chance this foldable could debut at a reduced price compared to its recent summer launch of flagship devices.</p><p>More information regarding its specifications wasn&apos;t available during the database discovery.</p><p>Elsewhere, those at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/moto-razr-50s-hdr-certification-3478859/">Android Authority</a> speculate that Motorola could debut a phone with a "similar package" to the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Razr from 2023</a>. That phone offered a small, 1.5-inch horizontal cover display, which offers quick looks at the time, notifications, and the like. The post purports that the company could take that design and offer a few iterative upgrades to differentiate the devices, but to ensure the costs remain low.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the potential name for the device overseas. Outside of the U.S., Motorola dubs its recent foldables the Razr 50 Ultra and Razr 50. In the States, those devices are sold as the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr 2024. It&apos;ll be interesting to see which way we go with the name from here and if we&apos;re in for a "Razr S 2024" or "Razr Lite 2024" scenario.</p>

<p>How low Motorola could go with this next Razr is an object of discussion, especially considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review#section-motorola-razr-2024-should-you-buy-it">Razr 2024</a> launched at $699. Its competition (think the Galaxy Z Flip 6) is much closer to $1,000 than anything else. Moreover, in Android Central&apos;s review, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> was mentioned as another <em>potential </em>competitor. The phone features a nice, intriguing design; however, it undercuts the Razr 2024 by a couple of hundred bucks.</p><p>While it may seem like $449 is the realm Motorola should shoot for, Nubia&apos;s clamshell sacrifices a lot. Nubia&apos;s foldable doesn&apos;t offer wireless charging, an IP rating, or highly polished software. With that in mind, Motorola might take a look at the purported "Razr 50s" and see how it can keep costs low but still offer what consumers expect.</p><p>On the flip side (no pun intended), we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, the pricier sibling with a more immersive display. Moto provided the phone with a large 4-inch pOLED cover display that takes viewing apps and notifications while closed to another level.</p>

<p>Samsung is expected to release its next wave of flagship tablets; however, users may find an upgraded accessory to go with it.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,145064.html">WinFuture</a> (German), Samsung is preparing to deliver a keyboard for its Galaxy Tab S10 series with quick access to its AI features. Rumors claim the company will implement a "Galaxy AI key" onto the new keyboard accessories for the next tablet series.</p><p>It&apos;s presently uncertain just what this button will surface/produce on the Tab S10 series when pressed. The publication anticipates that many of the new features hitting Galaxy devices through One UI 6.1.1 will be on the Tab S10. How this may look in practice is still unknown.</p><p>The post adds that the button may feature Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> logo, which is a made of four stars, all of varying sizes. The rendering is reportedly not official and is just a mockup of how Samsung could offer the accessory to consumers.</p><p>The publication states this "Galaxy AI key" may arrive on keyboard accessories and cases for the Tab S10 with an included keyboard. This information was supposedly "confirmed" to them by insiders close to the matter.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-ultra-galaxy-ai-same-design-leak">set of rumored renderings</a> of the Galaxy Tab S10 duo leaked in August, suggesting we&apos;re going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-drops-basic-tab-s10-rumors">without a base model</a> this year. The imagery claimed that Samsung won&apos;t chase any new design languages with its tablets once again. The devices may still feature a vertical dual camera array on the back panel. The Ultra model will likely continue to feature a notch on the top of its display for the front-facing camera cutout.</p><p>That rumor also clued us into a Galaxy AI feature the tablet duo could receive. The image showed the devices automatically generating transcripts during audio recording. Considering the rumor we&apos;ve heard about a "Galaxy AI key," perhaps it could help surface this functionality quickly.</p><p>The Ultra model is rumored to feature a 14.6-inch display, potentially indicating the Plus version could begin at around 12 inches.</p><p>Speculation states Samsung could launch its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-series-launch-month-rumors">tablet duo this fall</a>, potentially in October. The Galaxy Tab S10 might not hog the limelight later this year as the Galaxy S24 FE could join that debut, too.</p>

<ul><li>Google's recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta holds clues that point toward a major makeover for the system's notifications and quick settings panel.</li><li>Viewing notifications could produce a smaller panel that takes up less of your display while the full settings menu could hold smaller, circular icons.</li><li>The recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1.1 patch fixes a rebooting Pixel problem, but we're still waiting on the stable launch, which could happen in October.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Clues in Google&apos;s Android code suggest a makeover for its quick settings menu, which could impact the way notifications are displayed in future versions of Android.</p><p>A version of this quick settings revamp was discovered by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-notifications-quick-settings-overhaul-3478974/">Android Authority</a>) when perusing a recent Android 15 QPR1 Beta. He noticed a major change in the menu&apos;s functionality: it takes two fingers to open fully. Rahman states that the new menu (after swiping down) only takes up "a quarter of your screen." </p><p>However, if you&apos;re interested in opening it fully, users will reportedly need to drag two fingers down their display.</p><p>The full quick settings menu offers much smaller, circular options for what we already have on Android today: flashlight, airplane mode, Google Home, and more. The code states users can "hold and drag to rearrange tiles." That&apos;s not anything new, but what is new is the design. Google may keep the top four Android options as larger, pill-shaped buttons, leaving the rest as circular icons. This design looks similar to what&apos;s on newer Motorola phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review#section-motorola-razr-plus-2024-software">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>.</p><p>More importantly, there&apos;s less information with the (quicker) quick settings menu only dropping partway in this early preview. Google&apos;s code teases that the initial swipe down will only show new notifications in a rounded corner area with the time, date, and battery information. This could be a welcome change as the proposed redesign lets users continue to see the app they&apos;re in instead of just a menu.</p><p>Rahman adds that this redesign could hit users during Android 16&apos;s rollout and not anytime soon. The post states that many aspects of this revamp are "unfinished."</p>

<p>Rahman states that the existence of "Flexi" or Flexiglass in his screenshots indicates Google&apos;s codename for its "restructured" System UI. Supposedly, this will allow the company to treat each piece of its UI as its own component called a "scene." Perhaps this will lead to more changes and redesigns down the road.</p><p>If true, the idea of Android 16 is (quite literally) a year away. For now, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-1-minor-patch">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 1.1</a> update. The latest beta brought Google&apos;s recent Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL to the testing grounds. The minor patch was light as the company was eager to fix a strange rebooting issue that cropped up on IssueTracker.</p><p>Elsewhere, Android 15 is seemingly poised to bring a change to its DND, known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-priority-mode-qpr1-detailed">Priority Mode</a>." Early signs in the code suggest Google will let users customize their do-not-disturb experience alongside an option to "stay focused" while on their phones. The QPR beta is expected to be the December feature drop, but in the meantime, we&apos;re still waiting for Android 15&apos;s stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-android-15-update-release-3475495/">release in October</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Windows laptops have gotten a bit of a "glow-up," if you will. While Intel and AMD continue churning out chips that promise the best performance, Qualcomm might have just snuck ahead of them all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> series. </p><p>See, we&apos;ve been waiting for the day that Intel or AMD would release a chip that is capable of going toe-to-toe with Apple Silicon. To date, that has yet to come to fruition. </p><p>There&apos;s always some major compromise that we have to deal with, whether it be in the power department or battery life. Technically, you can get a laptop that&apos;s capable of matching or even surpassing Apple&apos;s M-series of chips in terms of raw power. But, good luck using the laptop for more than an hour or two before needing to find an outlet. </p><p>On the flip side, there are chips, even Arm SoCs, that provide endless hours of battery life. However, there&apos;s not enough performance to use more than a couple of apps at a time, and you&apos;re better suited to just get a tablet instead.</p><p>This problem isn&apos;t limited to just the Windows scene, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> also have their fair share of compromises. No, we aren&apos;t talking about the limitations of ChromeOS. But it&apos;s always a "pick your poison" situation, and there&apos;s yet to be an option that checks <em>all</em> of the boxes. </p><p>At the time, Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Chromebook Plus</a> initiative seemed like a great idea, and it still is. Offer a base level of specs and features, and toss in a few extra goodies, all while <em>trying</em> to ease the decision-making process. Times are a-changin&apos;, and it&apos;s time for Chromebook OEMs to go back to the drawing board with the Snapdragon X Elite in tow. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3" name="macbook-pro-14-microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 14 next to Surface Pro 11 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn&apos;t to say that you can&apos;t get both great performance <em>and</em> battery life out of a Chromebook. What I am saying, is that after spending some time with the latest Surface Pro 11, it can get even better. Furthermore, I&apos;m frankly shocked that we haven&apos;t seen any Chromebooks announced with the Snapdragon X Elite. </p><p>Further driving the point home, is that I&apos;m writing this during IFA 2024, at which point Qualcomm has announced more Snapdragon chips that will make their way into Windows laptops. More importantly, this upcoming crop of laptops will be much more affordable than the initial wave, with some priced as low as $700. </p><p>Maybe that&apos;s the answer as to why we have yet to see new Snapdragon-powered Chromebooks. Although $700 might be seen as affordable in the Windows space, that&apos;s not the case with Chromebooks. For that, you&apos;re looking at the higher-end Chromebook models, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-features-rolling-out">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714</a>, ASUS Expertbook CX54 Chromebook Plus, and others. </p><p>Unfortunately, the real sweet spot for Chromebooks seems to be between the $300 to $500 price point. You might be able to stretch that to include the $600 bracket, but that&apos;s usually reserved for those higher-end options that are on sale for less.</p><p>Okay, so let&apos;s bring it back a bit. What is so special about the Snapdragon laptop chips that make me want one in a Chromebook? Well, at least in the case of the Surface Pro 11, it finally gives me both the performance and battery life that I look for in a laptop.</p>

<p>Imagine a non-Apple world where your laptop can last for at least 10-12 hours, while also being capable of running a bunch of apps at the same time without so much as a stutter. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been experiencing with my Surface Pro 11, which doesn&apos;t even feature the most "powerful" Snapdragon X Elite model there is. </p><p>More often than not, I&apos;m reaching for the Surface than the Spin 714 or even my own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/mac/macbook/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-review-apple-does-it-again">M2 Max MacBook Pro</a>. Not because there&apos;s anything drastically different about Windows, but because I know that 9/10 times, it will still have plenty of battery left, even after sitting unused for a day or two.</p><p>Perhaps another reason why we&apos;ve yet to see anything of substance here is because of <em>how</em> Qualcomm is making this work. We&apos;ve seen Arm on Windows devices before, but it failed rather spectacularly, despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-qualcomms-not-making-special-chromebook-chip">Surface Pro X</a> being practically perfect from a design perspective. </p><p>The reason is that there just aren&apos;t very many developers that are willing (or able) to make their apps compatible with Arm CPUs. There are quite a few, with Adobe notably offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/adobe-confirms-when-premiere-pro-illustrator-indesign-and-after-effects-will-run-on-windows-11-on-arm-natively">Arm-compatible</a> versions of many of its Creative Cloud applications. But, what about indie developers or "one-man-band" developers that don&apos;t have the time or resources to do something like that? </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-3-external-display-work.jpg" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 multiple windows with external monitor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vGeuXbbC9oCmbnKzk9LvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where the fun part comes in, Qualcomm relies on a transition layer, allowing x86_64 apps to run on Arm, which is essentially a mobile platform. There have been some growing pains, but this was to be expected, and honestly, it&apos;s been a much better experience than the first time that this was attempted in the Windows arena. </p><p>Which gives me a nice little segue into the obvious — ChromeOS has been there before, and it works just fine. Our favorite ChromeOS tablet, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-ideapad-chromebook-duet-3-review">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3</a>, is powered by the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 SoC, a mobile-first chip. Aside from some bottlenecks with the 4GB version and the reliance on eMMC for storage, it works just fine. </p><p>No, you can&apos;t do <em>everything</em> with the Duet 3 as you can on one of the x86 Chromebooks. But, you <em>can</em> do much more than you might suspect, while still enjoying the fruits offered by the Play Store. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1726px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27" name="google-intel-ifa-2024-chromeos.jpg" alt="Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group at Intel alongside John Solomon, VP and GM of ChromeOS & Education at IFA 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgghcuEa4ubjgVmxA9yY27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1726" height="971" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor that may be playing a part in why we have yet to see the Snapdragon X Elite on a Chromebook is Google&apos;s partnership with Intel. At IFA 2024, Intel introduced its new lineup of Intel Core Ultra chips. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKK7ITG9wj8">presentation</a>, John Solomon, Vice President and General Manager of ChromeOS & Education was brought on stage by Intel&apos;s Jim Johnson, Senior VP and GM, Client Business Group.</p><p>The two spoke about the power of Intel processors, while also reinforcing the relationship between Intel and Google. A Gemini demo was also played in the background, showing off the upcoming Help Me Read feature, along with the excellent Magic Editor feature in Google Photos. More importantly, the point was driven home that all of the AI tasks were being performed on-device, without reliance on the cloud.</p><p>At first glance, it appears that Intel and Google&apos;s partnership isn&apos;t going away anytime soon. However, I couldn&apos;t help but feel as though the repeated mentions of "Chromebook Plus" was Google leaving the door open a bit. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the "Plus" moniker, but it could lead way to additional branding being added into the mix. </p>
<p>To me, pairing the Snapdragon X Elite with a Chromebook sounds like a match made in heaven. Dare I say that it would make for the perfect pairing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">return of the Pixelbook</a>? I mean, with HP bowing out of the premium Chromebook space, things are lining up, yet again, for Google to make a big splash.</p>

<ul><li>Android Auto may soon give users a way to easily ditch the streaming services and use local audio, instead.</li><li>Users may also be able to play radio stations through Android Auto instead of having to switch back and forth between it and the car's infotainment system.</li><li>The features may launch in Android Auto version 12.8.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto is convenient because it streams music and simultaneously allows you to stay connected to your phone and apps hassle-free while driving. A new update to the app might level up your audio streaming experience.</p><p>Folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-local-media-playback-apk-teardown-3477234/">Android Authority</a> have managed to perform an APK teardown of the latest Android Auto 12.8 version, wherein they spotted some clues indicating a new functionality that will allow users to play local media files stored on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, a new string in the teardown mentions "Car Local Media" and the corresponding labels attached. It is new for Android Auto as it previously only allowed users to play from their favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like YouTube Music or Spotify.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.39%;"><img id="YWuKAfwvevamNJpkPntNjS" name="Android-Auto-local-media-finding.jpg.jpg" alt="Android Auto local media support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YWuKAfwvevamNJpkPntNjS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, a new Car Radio string has also been found in the latest version of the app that could allow users to play their AM and FM stations. Up until now, users had to disconnect Android Auto and rely upon the car&apos;s onboard infotainment system to play the radio. </p><p>The new findings follow the previous radio string mentioned in the Android Auto 12.3/12.4 version of the app via an APK teardown done by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/17/android-auto-car-radio-teardown/">9to5Google</a>. All the evidence points to the possibility for Android users soon, which is welcoming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:26.39%;"><img id="B7psMV8Uexpm3nJq862dcS" name="Android-Auto-am-and-fm-support.jpg.jpg" alt="Android Auto Car Radio support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7psMV8Uexpm3nJq862dcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Local media could have some limitations even though the new functionality adds some convenience. It is believed to only allow users to play local media stored on their Android phones and not the audio stored on an external USB thumb drive or in the car&apos;s built-in storage for compatible cars. In such case, users will have to exit Android Auto again and go back to the car&apos;s infotainment system. </p><p>Regardless, it is still interesting to see Google working on Android Auto and bringing new ways for users to rely less on their phones while putting their focus on driving, which is safer. These latest functionalities could soon see the light of day as it appears that the company has been working on them for quite some time now, considering previous findings.</p>

<p>XGIMI has introduced its newest line of home and portable projectors at IFA 2024, aimed at the US market.</p>
<h2 id="mogo-3-pro-2">MoGo 3 Pro</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-3-pro-review">XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro</a> is a great step up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-mogo-2-pro-review">MoGo 2 Pro</a>. It now runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, so you no longer need a separate dongle. Plus, it has Netflix built right in for a smoother streaming experience.</p><p>Weighing in at just 1.1kg, the MoGo 3 Pro is practically begging to be taken on the go. Just hook it up to a power bank, and you&apos;ll have endless hours of "cinematic visuals and sound," according to XGIMI&apos;s press release.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro comes with a rotating base and DLP tech that delivers 1080p resolution, a 90% DCI-P3 color gamut for eye-popping visuals, and 450 ISO Lumens of brightness.</p>

<p>This portable projector has a protected lens and can project images up to 120 inches. The integrated hidden bracket lets you tilt the projector 130 degrees for the perfect viewing angle.</p><p>It also uses XGIMI&apos;s ISA 2.0 image correction technology to automatically fix keystone distortion, avoid obstacles, focus the image, and align the picture for perfect viewing.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro features two integrated 5W Harman Kardon speakers for powerful sound. You can also use it as a Bluetooth speaker and enjoy the Ambient Light Mode, which lights up to the rhythm of your music.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro costs $449, but if you grab it with the Powerbase stand (usually $129) as a bundle, you’ll only pay $499. You can also grab the Optical Filter attachment for $49 and the Carrying Case for $69.</p>

<p>A more budget-friendly alternative to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-elfin-review">Elfin</a> compact projector, the Elfin Flip features a brightness of 600 ISO lumens and runs on the Android TV operating system.</p><p>The Flip&apos;s specs aren&apos;t quite as high-end as the MoGo 3 Pro, but it&apos;s still great for movie nights. It tops out at 400 ISO lumens of brightness, offers 1080p resolution, and covers 113% of the Rec.709 color space. It’s got HDR10, a 27ms low-latency game mode, plus auto keystone correction, auto focus, and automatic screen alignment.</p><p>The integrated stand lets you tilt the Elfin Flip projector up to 150 degrees, so you can angle it however you need. However, it runs on WebOS, which is a surprise twist.</p><p>At $399, the Elfin Flip is a steal compared to the original Elfin at $649. It&apos;s perfect for movie buffs who want a projector they can toss in a bag.</p>

<p>The Aura 2 is XGIMI’s newest ultra-short throw projector. If space is at a premium, this model has you covered, requiring only a few inches from your wall or screen thanks to its ultra-short 0.177:1 throw ratio.</p><p>The Aura 2 crams theater-level sound and visuals into a compact short-throw design. With its Dual Light 2.0 tech, it’s ridiculously bright and color-accurate—2,300 ISO lumens, IMAX Enhanced, Dolby Vision, and 99% DCI-P3 color coverage. So, if you’re into crystal-clear colors and booming sound, this projector has you covered with four 15W Harman/Kardon speakers.</p><p>Amazingly, it also comes with a $100 price cut compared to its predecessor, now going for a surprisingly reasonable $2,699.</p>
<h2 id="horizon-s-series-2">Horizon S series</h2>
<p>XGIMI has also unveiled two Horizon S Series projectors, namely the $1,299 S Pro and the $1,899 S Max.</p><p>The Horizon S Pro is a premium projector with Dual Light 2.0 technology, blending tri-color laser and LED for super bright images. It’s Dolby Vision-ready and comes with a flexible stand that swivels 360º horizontally and 135º vertically.</p>

<p>With 1,700 ISO lumens and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, it’s designed to wow. Harman/Kardon speakers with 2×12 output, DTS, and Dolby Audio, plus ISA 5.0 tech for real-time adjustments and an electric sliding cover, make it a real standout.</p><p>Furthermore, the Horizon S Max takes the Dual Light 2.0 tech and cranks it up a notch with Dolby Vision and IMAX Enhanced certifications—something no projector has done before. It’s 30% brighter than the previous model, boasting 3,000 ISO lumens and a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.</p><p>Neither of these models gets the Google TV upgrade, though; they’re sticking with the Android TV OS from the Horizon Ultra.</p>

The brand is building on that foundation with the MoGo 3 Pro, which has notable upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>The MoGo 3 Pro is brighter — going up to 450 lumens — and it has dual 5W drivers while retaining the same weight as the MoGo 2 Pro. XGIMI overhauled the design with this generation, and the projector looks much more upmarket, and has a unique pivoting system that makes it a breeze to set up and use.</p><p>The biggest addition is Netflix integration; XGIMI now offers Google TV with a native Netflix client, and you no longer have to rely on a workaround to use the streaming service. That alone makes the projector worthy of recommendation over the MoGo 2 Pro and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-halo-plus-portable-projector-review">Halo+</a>, and there are plenty of other upgrades on offer. I used all of XGIMI&apos;s portable projectors thus far, and the MoGo 3 Pro is the best yet in this segment.</p>

<p>XGIMI unveiled the MoGo 3 Pro at IFA 2024, and the projector is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Licensed-Adjustable-Portable/dp/B0D8HRH431/">now available on Amazon for $449</a> as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-3-pro?variant=41635185623088">brand&apos;s website</a>. The pricing is identical to the MoGo 2 Pro, and XGIMI is bundling the Creative Optical Filter accessory with all orders, a $49 value. If you intend to use the projector at home and want a mount that doubles as a charger, you can get the MoGo 3 Pro with the PowerBase Stand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-3-pro?variant=41635185655856">as a bundle for $499</a>.</p><p>XGIMI is doubling down on accessories this year, and there&apos;s a carrying case that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/xgimi-carrying-case">costs an extra $69</a>. The case has a faux leather design with suede lining, and it does a great job securing the MoGo 3 Pro.</p><p>In addition to the MoGo 3 Pro, XGIMI is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Vision-Enhanced-Lumens/dp/B0D8KRD3JK">launching the Aura 2 UST projector</a>, and the Horizon S Max and S Pro. </p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-mogo-3-pro-design-and-accessories"><span>XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro: Design and accessories</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WrgbbeTSVjwWPLTSZNd8vn" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-1.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WrgbbeTSVjwWPLTSZNd8vn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To call the design of the MoGo 3 Pro an upgrade over its predecessor would be an understatement. It is instead a fundamental reimagining of what a portable projector should look like, and the cylindrical chassis makes the MoGo 3 Pro that much more elegant while increasing portability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9qWFMvWibdWsY3DDjE8FZ5" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-13.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9qWFMvWibdWsY3DDjE8FZ5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design consists of two parts: the base houses the dual 5W audio drivers, and the projection hardware, ports, and active cooling are located up top. Both parts are connected by a built-in stand, and the projector pivots on the stand, allowing you to easily adjust the image by 130 degrees. There&apos;s a sliding metal rail inside the stand that lets you change the positioning as well, and it makes a big difference.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M5v3HEVudypamwSjJGH2K" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-4.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M5v3HEVudypamwSjJGH2K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The changes to the design makes the MoGo 3 Pro that much more usable on a variety of surfaces, and XGIMI nailed the design brief. The projector lens tucks into the base when not in use, and it doesn&apos;t get any scratches or dust as a result. There&apos;s also a lanyard on the side that lets you hook the projector to the outside of a bag — if you&apos;re feeling adventurous.</p>

<p>If you want a traditional way to take the projector on the road, XGIMI has a carrying case accessory that&apos;s ideal for the job. It has a hard shell design with PU leather and suede lining, and it is water and dust-resistant. The case accommodates the MoGo 3 Pro and the bundled remote, but there&apos;s no provision for the charging plug.</p>

<p>XGIMI also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/xgimi-powerbase-stand">PowerBase Stand</a> that is a floor stand and a power bank. The stand houses a 20000mAh battery, and allows you to power the MoGo 3 Pro with relative ease. It isn&apos;t convenient to use outdoors, but if you plan to use the projector at home and need an integrated solution, it is a decent choice — provided you buy the bundled option. It costs $129 as a standalone product, and you may as well get a dedicated power bank and regular floor stand instead.</p>

<p>My favorite accessory is the Creative Optical Filter. It&apos;s basically a fish-eye lens that you can attach to the MoGo 3 Pro, magnifying the projection and distorting the edges, ideal if you want to set up an ambient projection on the ceiling. It is used in conjunction with XGIMI Wall, a custom app that has dynamic backgrounds.</p><p>The sleeker design of the MoGo 3 Pro gives it a much better presence, and it&apos;s just easier to set up and use anywhere. Coming in at just 2.4lb, the MoGo 3 Pro is inherently portable, and the tweaks to the design make it a better overall product.</p>

<p>Just like the MoGo 2 Pro, there isn&apos;t a built-in battery on the MoGo 3 Pro, and you&apos;ll need to power it via a wall plug or power bank. XGIMI bundles a standard 65W USB PD charger in the box, and you can use your own. Any power bank or power station that delivers 65W of power via the PD standard also fits the brief.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zG7FhRkV3db7DxX4fUufs" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-6.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zG7FhRkV3db7DxX4fUufs.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the integrated design, you don&apos;t get much in the way of ports; there&apos;s a Micro HDMI and USB-A port on the side, and that&apos;s about it. The projector has the USB-C port at the bottom of the stand, and the only physical control is the power button. There&apos;s a fan at the back that does a good job cooling the unit, and it isn&apos;t audible in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QiDSoKaHok7uziV3gHuYJ7" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-16.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QiDSoKaHok7uziV3gHuYJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MoGo 3 Pro shares the same hardware as the Halo+; it is powered by a quad-core Arm Cortex A53 cluster that goes up to 1.3GHz. There&apos;s 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and you get a Mali-G52 with a solitary shader core. The projector doubles as a regular Bluetooth speaker, and the dual 5W drivers get pretty loud — more so than I imagined. The 360-degree design makes a difference in this area, and there isn&apos;t much distortion even with high volume.</p>
<p>Coming to connectivity, you get Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 5.1, and while there&apos;s no Wi-Fi 6, there were no issues connecting to my home network and streaming content. Similar to other XGIMI projectors, the MoGo 3 Pro has auto keystone correction and autofocus, and regardless of how often you change the orientation of the projector, the keystone correction calibrates the image in a matter of seconds — it goes a long way in making the MoGo 3 Pro hassle-free to use.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-xgimi-mogo-3-pro-picture-quality"><span>XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro: Picture quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QgYfWXtejjJEnLi3mv3Ry5" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-14.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgYfWXtejjJEnLi3mv3Ry5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MoGo 3 Pro is a DLP projector that uses an LED light source and a 1.2:1 throw ratio, and it goes up to a 1080p resolution. It goes up to 450 lumens — 50 lumen more than its predecessor. There&apos;s a noticeable difference between the two in regular use, and along with increased brightness, the MoGo 3 Pro has better color vibrancy. I recently tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/yaber-t2-plus-review">Yaber&apos;s T2 Plus</a>, and the MoGo 3 Pro easily outmatches that portable projector in both color accuracy and brightness.</p><p>You&apos;ll still need to minimize ambient light to be able to use the projector — it doesn&apos;t get anywhere as bright as the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-projector-review">Horizon Pro</a> — but it has a better showing than just about any other portable projector today, and that&apos;s a big deal.</p><p>There are three brightness modes — Standard, Eco, and Performance — and the projector uses Eco mode by default. You can switch to the Standard mode from the settings, and this is what you&apos;ll use most of the time. That&apos;s because you can only get maximum brightness when using the bundled XGIMI wall plug. Even if you have any other 65W PD charger or power bank, you&apos;re limited to the Standard mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="43M9mdRp6aiQJDzq9Fyck" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-5.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/43M9mdRp6aiQJDzq9Fyck.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fan kicks into high gear in Performance mode, and it gets sufficiently loud that you&apos;ll need to turn up the volume to drown out its sound. While you get better brightness and color accuracy, the hassle of using the bundled charger means you miss out on portability, so I just connected the MoGo 3 Pro to the massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-300w-48000mah-power-bank-review">48000mAh Nexode power bank</a>.</p><p>There&apos;s an ambient mode that creates diffused light when you tilt the projector lens down, and it&apos;s a nifty feature. While the MoGo 3 Pro has smaller audio drivers this time around, it still delivers powerful sound.</p>

<p>The MoGo 3 Pro has a standard Google TV interface, but there&apos;s one pivotal inclusion: Netflix. The brand finally managed to secure a Netflix license, and the platform is installed out of the box on the MoGo 3 Pro. That&apos;s a huge deal, and you no longer have to use a workaround or install a web client to stream Netflix on an XGIMI projector.</p><p>The interface is decent, but it isn&apos;t fluid, and you will have to be patient as you&apos;re navigating it — this is no Shield TV. That said, there isn&apos;t any noticeable lag when streaming content, and the MoGo 3 Pro held up just as well as other portable projectors in this category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xHSaUaFRuNbsgx7NLXour6" name="xgimi-mogo-3-pro-17.jpg" alt="XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHSaUaFRuNbsgx7NLXour6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bundled remote is decent enough, and while it is made out of plastic and doesn&apos;t have backlighting, it comes with all the requisite buttons.</p>

<p>If you need a brighter image, XGIMI&apos;s Halo+ goes up to 700 lumens, and there&apos;s a new version of the projector that has the same Netflix integration as the MoGo 3 Pro. It isn&apos;t as easy to set up, and you miss out on the effortless adjustability, and at $799, it costs a lot.</p><p>The MoGo 2 Pro is still a decent choice, and it should be discounted now that the 3 Pro is available. You don&apos;t get Netflix and miss out on the adjustable design, but it has a bright projection, and better sound.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a stylish projector with good onboard sound</li><li>You need a bright projection</li><li>You need Netflix and Google TV</li><li>You want auto keystone correction and portability</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a projector with a built-in battery</li></ul>
<p>Overall, there isn&apos;t much to fault on the MoGo 3 Pro. The projector has one of the best designs in this category, and the ability to easily adjust the projection angle unlocks a range of new use cases. The image quality itself is terrific, and the MoGo 3 Pro gets sufficiently bright and detailed. You still can&apos;t use it in daylight, but that&apos;s the case with all portable projectors.</p><p>The lack of a built-in battery is going to be a deal-breaker to some, but I think this is a more elegant system; you get much better battery life by connecting the MoGo 3 Pro to any decent-sized power bank, and the extensibility of connecting over USB-C beats the convenience of a built-in battery.</p><p>Most of all, the inclusion of Netflix creates the biggest differentiator. I&apos;ve reviewed and recommended XGIMI&apos;s offerings for over four years now, and the biggest pain point is missing Netflix integration. That&apos;s not a problem now, and if you need a portable projector that&apos;s easy to carry and has a bright projection, the MoGo 3 Pro is the one to beat.</p>

<p>Samsung is finally rolling out the One UI 6.1.1 update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series, packed with AI features and the September 2024 security patch.</p><p>At IFA 2024, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-expands-latest-galaxy-ai-features-to-even-more-users-around-the-world" target="_blank">revealed</a> during a press conference that One UI 6.1.1 is officially rolling out to its latest flagship devices. The company also mentioned that many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">beloved Samsung devices</a> will get the update next week.</p><p>This means the One UI 6.1.1 update is making its way to a wider range of Galaxy devices, including the Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 5, and Tab S9 series. These devices will have access to the advanced AI features introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>Productivity gets a boost with the One UI 6.1.1 update. New features like Note Assist, PDF Overlay Translation, and Sketch to Image streamline tasks. Note Assist can translate and summarize notes, while PDF Overlay Translation offers text translation for PDFs, images, and graphs. Sketch to Image turns simple sketches into image options.</p><p>The update also makes communication a breeze. With AI-powered tools like Interpreter, Listening Mode, and Chat Assist, translating languages and getting messaging suggestions is way easier. Plus, the Composer feature gives a hand with writing more effectively.</p><p>Of course, there&apos;s the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> feature, made with Google, for quick visual searches. Photography fans will also love the improved Portrait Mode and the new Instant Slow-mo feature.</p><p>One UI 6.1.1 also brings in fresh wallpapers that adjust based on the weather and time of day.</p><p>You can use AI features like Composer, Sketch to Image, Interpreter, and Note Assist for free until the end of 2025. Samsung hasn’t revealed how it&apos;ll charge for these features after that.</p><p>It should be noted that even after installing the update, the One UI version will stay at 6.1. Samsung uses the x.1.1 One UI version numbers exclusively for foldable devices and tablets.</p><p>Galaxy devices in Korea were the first to get the One UI 6.1.1 update on September 5. The update will be available in North America and Europe starting September 9.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I was quick to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-still-cant-get-the-basics-right-on-pixels">criticize the Pixel 9 series</a> shortly after launch, and I called out Google for moving the needle enough with its latest devices. Now that I&apos;ve used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> for two weeks, I&apos;m ready to admit that my initial assessment was incorrect — Google made a lot of changes to the phone that are noticeable in daily use.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>The first area of differentiation is the build quality; Google switched to a new design language with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and while the phone ends up looking like an iPhone because of the flat sides, it feels much better in-hand than its predecessors. It has good weight distribution, and the squarish design with added width around the mid-frame offers increased structural rigidity.</p><p>I&apos;ve broken enough Pixels to know how fragile these devices can be, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL came away unscathed after a few tumbles, so it&apos;s clear that Google paid attention to this area. In a similar vein, I&apos;ve had issues with ports and buttons on previous Pixels, but that just isn&apos;t the case on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — the build quality is finally on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p>
<p>Another big change has to do with the modem. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is powered by the Tensor G4, and while it isn&apos;t noticeably faster than the G3, the Exynos 5400 modem delivers much better connectivity. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a> couldn&apos;t maintain a reliable connection to my home network, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have those shortcomings; I got a steady signal throughout the house, and while the signal strength wasn&apos;t as high as Qualcomm-powered devices, I had zero issues in regular use.</p><p>Overheating was a big problem last year, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL mitigates that via the use of a vapor chamber and aggressive power limits. Google set up the G4 to throttle earlier than the G3, and this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">evident in the benchmarks</a>. The result is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL isn&apos;t anywhere as good as Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered devices at gaming — it throttles way too quickly, and you get visible jitter in demanding games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Br5AMsMAifmQ2PSg86wRqP" name="pixel-9-9-pro-xl-5.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL with Vivo X100 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Br5AMsMAifmQ2PSg86wRqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upside is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermals of any phone I used in 2024; it doesn&apos;t exceed 42 degrees under full load, and it&apos;s obvious that Google configured the Tensor G4 this way to prevent any overheating. While the Pixel 9 Pro XL isn&apos;t a gaming powerhouse by any measure, there is a noticeable difference in fluidity in day-to-day tasks over the Pixel 8 Pro. I had instances where the 8 Pro would lag in mundane tasks like Chrome or Instagram, and that just hasn&apos;t been an issue on the 9 Pro XL.</p><p>On that note, multitasking was an annoyance on Pixel 8 Pro, and the phone had a tendency to kill background apps after a few hours. Google changed this on the 9 Pro XL, and you can have a lot of background apps active without any issues. I understand that all of these seem like trivial problems, but they&apos;ve been a constant annoyance on previous Pixels, and it&apos;s good to see Google addressing these shortcomings on its latest device.</p><p>That said, there are things that Google needs to fix. The Pixel 9 Pro XL takes too long to save portrait shots to the gallery, and there is shutter lag — you can&apos;t take portrait shots one after the other, and that just isn&apos;t a problem on any other high-end phone I used this year.</p>

<p>After using the phone to take over a hundred photos, it&apos;s clear that Google needs to change the camera hardware. While the brand is still the best at software tuning, the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn&apos;t have the same caliber of cameras as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, Vivo X100 Ultra, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve never had an issue with Google&apos;s software efforts; if anything, I tolerated the second-rate hardware in the past because of the excellent software. There&apos;s plenty to like in this area on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, with Google doubling down on AI efforts. All major phone brands offer some level of AI-based features, Google has meaningful additions I actually use.</p><p>With the Pixel 8 Pro, I always got the sense that the phone isn&apos;t built to the same tolerance as other flagships, but that isn&apos;t a problem on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — you&apos;re no longer getting a great camera attached to an average phone. The rest of the hardware is just as good, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL is significantly better than its predecessors in this regard. </p>
