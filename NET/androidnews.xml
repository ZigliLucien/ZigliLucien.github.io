<hr>
<p>Chinese phone maker TECNO has announced the CAMON 30 series, including the CAMON 30 Pro 5G, CAMON 30 5G, and CAMON 30. The latest mid-range models boast crazy good cameras and stunning design, promising to redefine what a phone in this range can do.</p><p>The new TECNO CAMON 30 series decided to say goodbye to the angular rear panels seen in the older models. Instead, TECNO introduced a fresh look with "industry-first" marble-effect suede <em>Tech-Art Leather</em> finishes, available in various colors like Alps Snowy Silver, Emerald Lake Green, Iceland Basaltic Dark, Sahara Sand Brown, and Uyuni Salt White.</p><p>As you probably guessed, the standout feature here is the camera system, which has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">leading Android camera phones</a> in its sights. The CAMON 30 series boasts a 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera.</p>

<p>With AI-powered enhancements, these cameras promise to provide a top-notch photography experience. On the Pro models, you&apos;ll find additional cameras on the back: a 50MP wide-angle lens and a 2MP macro lens, perfect for capturing subjects as close as 2.5cm.</p><p>Up front, there&apos;s a 50MP selfie snapper with eye-tracking autofocus, supporting 4K60fps video recording. Both the CAMON 30 5G and the CAMON 30 sport the same front-facing camera hardware, though they don&apos;t match the same selfie video performance.</p>

<h2 id="ai-capabilities-2">AI capabilities</h2>
<p>Of course, no true 2024 Android phone would be complete without some talk of generative AI features. TECNO promises that the CAMON 30 lineup will support a range of AI-powered functionalities. One of these is called <em>Social Turbo</em>, designed to enhance third-party video calling apps. Users can expect to be able to change their voice and backgrounds and apply beauty filters for a more fun and personalized experience.</p><p>Another cool feature to look out for is the <em>AI Erase</em>, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Erase in Google Pixels</a>. This allows you to easily remove unwanted objects from your photos. Additionally, the CAMON 30 series supports <em>Universal Tone</em>, which TECNO claims to be the most advanced AI-powered multi-skin tone imaging technology available.</p><p>The CAMON 30 Pro 5G adds a unique AI feature called <em>AIGC Portrait</em>. This means you can create a wide range of portrait shots tailored to different occasions or social media purposes, all thanks to AI. These shots may not be real photos, but AI-generated content based on your selfies.</p>

<h2 id="run-of-the-mill-specs-2">Run-of-the-mill specs</h2>
<p>In terms of display, the CAMON 30 Pro 5G is at the forefront, boasting a massive 6.78-inch 144Hz AMOLED screen and Dolby Atmos audio for an immersive experience. The series also includes <em>Wet Hand Touch</em> technology and holds an IP54 rating for added durability.</p><p>The CAMON 30 runs on the Helio G99 chipset, while its 5G version upgrades to the Dimensity 7020 SoC. The 30 Pro takes it even further with the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate chipset. However, the 30 Pro stands out as the only variant equipped with a 50MP OIS <em>Steady Night Portrait</em> main rear camera.</p><p>On the Pro models, you can enjoy up to 24GB of RAM (including 12GB of extended memory), along with up to 512GB of flash storage. Plus, there&apos;s a 9-layer "gaming-grade" cooling system to keep things running smoothly during intense gaming sessions.</p><p>With a massive 5000mAh battery and support for 70W charging, you can go from 0 to 50% in just 16 minutes. Tecno claims the battery is capable of enduring 1,600 charge cycles and will retain over 80% battery health for at least four years.</p>
<h2 id="limited-availability-2">Limited availability</h2>
<p>While these phones will begin shipping to buyers in a few weeks, there&apos;s some disappointing news for those who want to get their hands on one of them. The CAMON 30 series won&apos;t be widely accessible right away. Initially, the three models will be sold in Africa, with plans to expand to more markets later on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CAMON 30 Premier 5G is set to debut later this month. These phones will reach over 70 territories in the upcoming months, though unfortunately, the US won&apos;t be among them.</p><p>Nevertheless, the CAMON 30 phones bring some exciting additions to this year&apos;s array of new Android devices, even if they&apos;re not easily accessible for everyone.</p><p>No pricing details have been disclosed for any of the four handsets, as they will vary depending on the region. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-20-pro-and-camon-20-premier-review">CAMON 20 Pro</a> 5G was launched at a retail price of $199, so it&apos;s likely that its successor will fall within a similar price range.</p>

<ul><li>Google introduces new features with the April 2024 update to the Pixel Watch.</li><li>It brings haptics to the current time when a user gestures on the watch face.</li><li>The update also brings improvements to auto brightness settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google announced today (Apr. 3) that its first-gen Pixel Watch will receive the April 2024 update. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/267278897/google-pixel-watch-update-apr-2024?hl=en&sjid=16971336777914090065-AP">announcement post</a>, the Pixel Watch support team shared the new update bearing the build number TWD9.240405.001. Its rollout has begun, and it is likely to reach all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> owners over the next week, per their carriers and device models.</p>
<p>The global firmware rollout “includes new features, numerous bug fixes, and performance updates for Pixel Watch users.” It additionally brings a Vibration Watch feature, and as the name suggests, users will notice the current time playing haptics whenever a Pixel Watch user utilizes gestures on the watch face.</p><p>Additionally, users can also experience improvements in auto brightness functionality on the Pixel Watch. With the new update, the relevant auto-brightness settings will improve, allowing “users to perceive the difference when switching levels easily.”</p><p>Pixel Watch owners can head over to their smartwatch’s <strong>Settings> System> System Updates</strong> and tap on the “Your watch is up to date” screen to check for the OTA update, per the rollout timeline, as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>While it seems like a minor monthly update to the original Pixel Watch, it is still unclear whether it includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-could-gain-a-new-app-download-indicator">recently spotted</a> tracking app downloads feature. For the unaware, the Pixel Watch tested a new progress bar for app updates downloaded via Google Play Store, similar to what we see on Pixel phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>That said, the latest firmware release comes along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-devices-get-march-feature-drop">March feature drop</a>, which brought some noteworthy features to the original Pixel Watch. The notable ones included were pace training, heart zone training, and auto workout mode—all of which were previously exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. Additionally, Pixel Watch owners also received the Fitbit Relax app as a guide to users’ breathing exercises.</p>

<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing OS 2.5.3 on Phone (2)What's new:🔮 Added option to apply Nothing Icon Pack solely to the home screen, for better accessibility in the App Drawer.➡️ Improved icon organisation on the Home Screen by enabling users to scroll through pages while holding app icons.… pic.twitter.com/wH7pnrCWqL<a href="https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1775134365221114151">April 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Phone 2 users will see a new option to “apply Nothing Icon Pack” for the home screen, which promises better accessibility in the app drawer. Additionally, users will also see an improved icon organization on the home screen that allows users to scroll through pages “while holding app icons.”</p><p>Other notable improvements with the <strong>Nothing OS 2.5.3</strong> include a resolved connectivity issue with Bluetooth media players. The changelog from the tweet notes the other optimizations that come to the animations in specific scenarios for smoother transitions. </p><p>Lastly, the Phone 2 owners can also experience improved system stability that promises to enhance the overall device’s performance in the new update.</p>

<p>The latest OS 2.5.3 update appears to be long overdue, since Nothing’s other devices, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-review">Phone 1</a> and the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Phone 2a</a>, are way past the 2.5.3 update. Phone 2 users have been anticipating the update over the past few weeks now, but it looks like Nothing took its time to bring the said firmware release.</p><p>The previous Nothing OS 2.5.2 version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-glyph-freezing-update-rollout">was released</a> in January 2024, which brought several new features and customizations to the Phone 2. It included direct access to the Glyph Jnterface’s Music Visualisation and other refinements to the lock screen interface, amongst others.</p><p>That said, the latest incremental update is an extension to the significant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-2-android-14-rollout">Nothing OS 2.5 update</a>, which brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> to the Phone 2 in December 2023.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit is rolling out its integration process for users Health Connect data.</li><li>Users will find options to sync active calories burned, basal body temperature, and basal metabolic rate statistics from Health Connect.</li><li>The "You" tab now houses a new "Records" tab that will let users toggle Health Connect stats on the "Today" tab.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out integration for the Fitbit app that lets Health Connect users bring their stats over.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/02/fitbit-app-health-connect-2/">9to5Google</a>, the Fitbit app is starting to display a "New Health Connect features" card that contains your health and wellness stats. Its arrival lets users set things up by tapping devices (or battery percentage) in the top left corner. From there, you&apos;ll find the new Health Connect card alongside a "set up" button.</p><p>During this process, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sign-fitbit-premium">Fitbit</a> states that users will be able to sync their fitness data <em>and </em>have the choice to decide which stats carry over. The permissions page lets users select between active calories burned, basal body temperature, and basal metabolic rate statistics. Users can toggle any of these stats to carry over into the Fitbit app or  "allow all" to take everything.</p><p>Unfortunately, users only can track their combined health statistics on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. The publication notes that the Google Pixel Watch, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, Fitbit watches, and trackers only support Fitbit-based metrics.</p><p>To begin seeing your combined health stats on the "Today" tab, users must first hop into the "You" tab for a new "Records" section. In there, folks should find a settings page letting them decide whether the app should show Fitbit data only or a combination of Fitbit and Health Connect stats.</p><p>That settings page informs that users will see data from both parties, including information about steps, distance, energy burned, and more.</p>

<p>Fitbit&apos;s option to integrate users&apos; Health Connect stats with its app is "slowly" appearing across Android devices. Users should give it some time or even the rest of the week before it appears widely.</p><p>Other news involving Fitbit includes the appearance of a new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-kickstarts-walk-mate-notifications-study">Walk Mate</a>" feature in its app code back in March. It was discovered that these personalized notifications would tailor themselves to fit the individual health needs of the user. The app&apos;s code seemingly spoiled the idea that Fitbit is designing these notifications for folks with an average of 8,000 steps a day or less.</p><p>Also, an updated Fitbit support page detailed the coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fitbit-third-party-app-removal-announced">removal of third-party content</a> for its devices for EU residents. Slated to occur in June, users in the EU will lose access to third-party clock faces and apps for a few of Fitbit&apos;s devices. Users have until the removal date to download and install any third-party content they&apos;d like before disappearing for good, leaving behind Google and Fitbit-made apps only.</p>

<ul><li>A dive into Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 shows Google is working on a new "color contrast" settings page to boost app readability.</li><li>The page, tucked inside the beta's code, would let users alter the contrast level of "text, buttons, and icons."</li><li>Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 rolled out yesterday (Apr. 1) and included many bug fixes and solutions for system glitches.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A dive into Android 14&apos;s latest beta seems to show signs of a new settings page that could help boost the readability of apps.</p><p>As spotted by Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/04/android-15-color-contrast-settings">Android Headlines</a>, Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1 contains a hidden "color contrast" page that lets users alter how text appears on their displays. Google&apos;s description reads, "higher contrast makes text, buttons, and icons stand out more." The page under development gave Rahman a quick preview of how his changes would affect an app.</p><p>It looks like users will be given three options to change: default, medium, and high. Leaving the contrast at "default" lets the Android system express your Material You theme in paler colors as it currently does. However, pushing things to "medium" or even "high" shows how deep and rich the colors become.</p><p>This page includes a second toggleable option that lets users "maximize text contrast." Google states that this button will "add a black or white background around text to increase contrast."</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that Android supports these changes across its UI in light and dark modes. The settings page warns that users may find that not all apps support "all color and text contrast settings."</p>

<p>Rahman states this new color contrast page could be the final product of an older "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1645448240991547396">contrast levels</a>" slider seen during Android 14 Developer Preview 2 in 2023.</p><p>Those diving into the code of Android 14&apos;s latest beta will be able to surface the new settings, but it remains hidden for the average tester. Rahman states that once it officially rolls out, users will find it under <strong>Settings > Accessibility > Color and Motion</strong>. Speculation suggests this should happen during the arrival of Android 15 later this year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-21-out-now">Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1</a> started rolling out to enrolled Pixel testers yesterday (Apr. 1), which included a slew of bug fixes.

<ul><li>Rumors suggest Sony could keep the same camera hardware for its upcoming Xperia 1 VI.</li><li>Such a move would see the device featuring the same 48MP primary lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens, and 12MP telephoto lens.</li><li>There's speculation that Sony is more interested in boosting the device's image quality, and this could happen because it is leveraging new AI software.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Information is slowly surfacing about Sony&apos;s next flagship, and new rumors suggest some aspects could stay the same.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sumahodigest.com/?p=28702">Smartphone Digest</a> (Japanese), murmurings on Weibo state Sony&apos;s Xperia 1 VI might stick with the same camera tech as the Xperia 1 V (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_1_vi_may_have_exactly_the_same_cameras_as_its_predecessor-news-62259.php">GSMArena</a>). The upcoming device may continue to feature a 48MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens.</p><p>Rumors add that the device&apos;s primary lens could adopt Sony&apos;s Exmor T sensor for mobile.</p><p>Supposedly, Sony is more concerned with the image quality of its Xperia 1 VI sensors as the company looks to leverage AI software. The publication states this stronger focus could result in the phone&apos;s camera performance in "auto mode."</p><p>The Xperia 1 VI was allegedly spotted receiving its FCC certification, as well. This could mean we&apos;re approaching its official launch, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see.</p><p>Last year&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-v-launch">Xperia 1 V</a> featured the same 48MP, 12MP, and 12MP triple array on its rear panel. A deeper look at the specifications shows that the primary lens features f/1.9 aperture and a 1/1.35" sensor, which is rumored to remain the same.</p><p>What&apos;s more, the Xperia 1 V was launched last year with an Exmor T sensor. This fact confirms speculation that any improvements Sony implements will be due to its internal software.</p>

<p>This second batch of rumors surfaced two weeks after the upcoming Xperia 1 VI was rumored to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperai-1-vi-display-aspect-rumors">lose its high-quality display</a>. Also, from Weibo, it was alleged that the device would drop from 4K resolution to 2K Plus. Additionally, a change to its form factor could shift the phone into a shorter and slightly wider design.</p><p>Sony is rumored to move away from its 21:9 aspect ratio in favor of a 19.5:9 setup.</p><p>Moreover, sightings about the phone&apos;s approval of FCC certification might line up with whispers about a May 2024 launch window. The Xperia 1 V launched in May 2023, so it would make sense if Sony did the same thing this year.</p>

It&apos;s an awesome device for streaming content or getting work done on the go, but not everything here is perfect.</p><p>As we describe in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-review">our OnePlus Pad review</a>, the tablet seems to lag occasionally while browsing (something appears to be up with the software) and you can&apos;t expand the storage beyond the 128GB that&apos;s available on the device. Some folks may also take issue with the tablet&apos;s large size, and you&apos;ll need to buy a keyboard separately if you wish to use the Pad like a laptop. Aside from those issues, the OnePlus Pad is an excellent choice if you need something with long-lasting battery life and a vibrant display. And thanks to this 17% discount at Amazon, the tablet is as cheap as it&apos;s ever been.</p>

Since Apple introduced the magnetic connection and wireless charging standard with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-iphone-12-review">iPhone 12</a> series, MagSafe has grown into what is easily the largest accessory ecosystem on the planet. It gets everything right, from simplicity to functionality to compatibility. An accessory you bought for the long-retired iPhone 12 mini will work with the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> with no problem. </p><p>Luckily, the MagSafe experience is imminent on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and that&apos;s thanks to the Qi2 standard. We don&apos;t know which mainstream phone will be the first to launch with Qi2, but it&apos;ll likely come sometime this year. Many were disappointed that Samsung didn&apos;t include Qi2 in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> that launched in January. </p><p>If you don&apos;t want to wait, the Peak Design ecosystem brings the MagSafe experience to Android phones today. As a longtime MagSafe user, I spent a few weeks using magnetic accessories provided by Peak Design on my iPhones and Android smartphones. With as little as one Peak Design phone case, your phone can tap into the expansive MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. If this is what the future of Qi2 on Android holds, I&apos;m excited about it. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Charger-Comparison.jpg" alt="An iPhone and an Android phone using MagSafe chargers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUJjixzaeqRyK5Y62c7wM7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Late in 2023, the Wireless Power Consortium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chargewithqi.com/resources/qi2-the-new-qi2-standard-for-wireless-devices/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Qi2 standard was ready to be included on new devices. There are a handful of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">benefits to the Qi2</a> standard, like 15W wireless charging as opposed to 5W speeds using regular Qi. And since devices must be certified by the WPC in order to use the Qi2 name and branding, you&apos;ll be certain that chargers and accessories will work with your phone. </p><p>However, the bigger part of Qi2 has little to do with charging. The standard includes support for the Magnetic Power Profile, and this is partially derived from Apple&apos;s own MagSafe tech. Qi2 includes a ring of magnets that&apos;ll help your phone align perfectly with a wireless charger&apos;s coils, which increases charging efficiency. More importantly, the Qi2 standard&apos;s magnet ring is interoperable with MagSafe. A future is shaping up where you&apos;ll be able to buy Qi2 or MagSafe accessories and use them with basically any new phone you can find.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL" name="Peak-Design-SlimLink.jpg" alt="The SlimLink connector on a Peak Design Everyday Case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9YxwTozKkmFdJW6KhxEFL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a surprising number of ways to get MagSafe to work with your Android phone in 2024. Some cases include built-in MagSafe rings, or you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">slap a MagSafe ring sticker on any phone</a> or case of your choosing. To me, using a Peak Design Everyday Case is one of the better options. There are Everyday Case options for all the biggest Android phone models, and they have more features than just MagSafe compatibility. In fact, Peak Design includes its own SlimLink connection standard as an alternative to MagSafe on the Everyday Case. </p><p>What separates Peak Design&apos;s ecosystem from all the other ways of getting MagSafe on Android is that it feels official. Things like magnetic sticker rings and cheap MagSafe phone cases often feel like hacky solutions rather than polished ones. By comparison, it&apos;s impossible to see that the Everyday Case supports MagSafe just by looking at it. Aside from the SlimLink mounting point, the Everyday Case looks just like any other premium case with a canvas exterior and plastic frame. </p><p>Completing the experience is a wide variety of first-party accessories that compare with Apple&apos;s own official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a>. For example, the Peak Design Mobile Wallet is like an Apple MagSafe Wallet, but better. I&apos;m on my third leather MagSafe Wallet from Apple, and I have had two replaced under warranty because they literally fell apart. So far, the Mobile Wallet seems better than the MagSafe Wallet in a number of ways. It also matches the Everyday Case in the same way that a leather MagSafe wallet matches Apple&apos;s official leather iPhone case.</p>

<p>However, the best part of using the Peak Design Everyday Case is that you can use it with non-Peak Design accessories. I&apos;ve used my Mobile Wallet with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, which I use without a case. I&apos;ve also used an official Apple MagSafe charger with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> through an Everyday Case. With these accessories, you can use the same great products with iPhones <em>and</em> Android phones. Considering that accessory makers consistently put more effort into creating products for iPhones, interoperability is a huge win for Android users.</p>

<p>By simply putting a Peak Design case on my Android phone, I&apos;ve been able to replicate the MagSafe experience. However, even a case won&apos;t be required for this kind of functionality in the not-so-distant future. When Android phones start shipping with Qi2, the accessory market will gain some much-needed parity between the iPhone and Android markets. If my time using Peak Design accessories is any indication, the future of smartphones with Qi2 looks bright. </p>

<ul><li>Google published a research paper about a new generative AI model for weather forecasting called Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (SEEDS). </li><li>Weather forecasting can be expensive, especially when highly trained AI models and supercomputers are involved, and that's where SEEDS comes into play.</li><li>Right now, Google's weather-forecasting AI models are comparable in accuracy to other methods, but they are much more efficient and cost-effective.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Even with detailed weather information in the palm of our hands, thanks to our smartphones, the weather consistently surprises us. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-weather-ui-redesign-phone-rollout">Weather</a> forecasting won&apos;t ever be perfect, but there may be room for it to improve, thanks to emerging technology. Using fancy artificial intelligence models and supercomputers seems like an obvious solution, but those options come with high costs. However, Google thinks it can make medium-range weather forecasting more efficient with generative artificial intelligence. </p><p>Google recently published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4489" target="_blank">report</a> and subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.research.google/2024/03/generative-ai-to-quantify-uncertainty.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on SEEDS, an AI model that stands for Scalable Ensemble Envelope Diffusion Sampler (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-seeds-weather-forecast-ai-prediction/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The company cites the problem with current methods for weather forecasting, such as physics-based simulation. While accurate, physics-based simulation becomes incredibly expensive at a large scale. </p><p>By comparison, Google says that SEEDS can "efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts <em>at scale </em>at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing SEEDS, our newest generative AI technology that advances medium-range weather forecasting. We can now generate ensemble forecasts more efficiently, helping us better predict rare and extreme weather events. 🌩️ #WeatherForecasting Learn more at https://t.co/wcVXjpS1dx pic.twitter.com/iLOEWVZelS<a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/1773774362413355099">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As they currently stand, AI models are not more accurate than other weather forecasting methods, but they are comparable. In the future, models like SEEDS could grow to be more accurate than physics-based models. However, a more realistic future could see a mix of physics-based models and generative AI models used to balance accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. </p><p>"SEEDS leverages the power of generative AI to produce ensemble forecasts comparable to those from the operational U.S. forecast system, but at an accelerated pace," Google says. "The results reported in this paper need only 2 seeding forecasts from the operational system, which generates 31 forecasts in its current version."</p><p>Google thinks that the increased efficiency of generative AI could allow weather reporting institutions to invest in forecasting in different ways. If a model like SEEDS could take a few physics-based models and turn them into a multitude of weather distributions, the money and resources saved from using fewer traditional simulations could fund a greater number of forecasts released more often. Alternatively, Google says the extra resources could be used to create more detailed physics-based models. </p><p>The SEEDS model joins MetNet-3 and GraphCast as Google&apos;s newest weather-related technologies. Whether or not SEEDS ever powers a consumer-grade product, it&apos;s cool to see use cases for AI outside of chatbots and image generators.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung Galaxy phones released in 2020 received their last monthly update with the March 2024 security patch. </li><li>From now on, the Galaxy S20 series will get quarterly software updates until support is completely dropped. </li><li>The specific smartphone models affected are the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung made waves when it decided to extend software support for a handful of older devices a few years ago and more recently when it promised seven years of support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. However, through all of this, the Galaxy S20 series has been left out. The company&apos;s smartphones released in 2020 did not get the operating system upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and now, its run of monthly software updates has ended. </p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-quarterly-updates-3430310/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> first reported, the Galaxy S20 series is no longer eligible for monthly updates and will receive them on a quarterly basis instead. Owners of the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy Note 20, and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra — all released in 2020 — should now expect updates four times a year, usually every three months. Following a lack of support for Android 14, the switch to quarterly updates is the latest step toward obsolescence for the four-year-old smartphone lineup. </p><p>While it might be disappointing to lose support for monthly security updates, this was somewhat expected. Samsung promised three years of OS upgrades for the Galaxy S20 series, which originally shipped with Android 10. After getting the bump to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> in 2022, Samsung&apos;s original promise was met. </p>

<p>That means the last monthly update to reach Galaxy S20 smartphones is the March 2024 update. All the fixes in the April 2024 update won&apos;t hit this lineup of phones until the next quarterly update, which is slated for June 2024. Interestingly, the Galaxy 20 series will be supported for a total of five years with security updates — albeit less frequently — which exceeds Samsung&apos;s original promise.</p><p>Although the Samsung Galaxy S20 series won&apos;t have access to the April 2024 security update, it has already started reaching other devices. Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S24 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/some-samsung-devices-are-already-getting-the-april-update-with-camera-improvements" target="_blank">started seeing the April 2024 patch</a> last week, and it included more than just bug fixes. Aside from those improvements, the April 2024 update featured support for 480p resolution with Instant Slow-Mo videos.</p><p>Fortunately, users who upgrade to the Galaxy S24 series can take advantage of seven years of software support, and that&apos;ll probably outlast the phone&apos;s hardware.</p>
