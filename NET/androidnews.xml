That may not seem like a lot, but discounts on the OnePlus 12 have been few and far between since the phone&apos;s February release date, and the ones that do appear never seem to last for long. In other words, don&apos;t sleep on this offer. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="781616fe-598e-432d-8fad-5192dc4eb6ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-512gb-unlocked-flowy-emerald/6570639.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:546px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:117.22%;"><img id="WpApNUoUctCEufrWszeWw8" name="oneplus-12-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpApNUoUctCEufrWszeWw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="546" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus 12 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-512gb-unlocked-flowy-emerald/6570639.p" data-dimension112="781616fe-598e-432d-8fad-5192dc4eb6ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99"><del>$799.99</del> <strong>$599.99 with activation | $699.99 unlocked at Best Buy</strong></a></p>
<p>Discounts on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> have been pretty uncommon so far, but Best Buy is attempting to change all of that by slashing a straight $100 off the OnePlus 12 when you buy unlocked, or $200 when you activate today. The same discounts are available on both the 256GB and 512GB configurations of the phone, so take your pick. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-12-512gb-unlocked-flowy-emerald/6570639.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="781616fe-598e-432d-8fad-5192dc4eb6ab" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a stylish and incredibly fast smartphone with loads of battery life and great cameras; you&apos;re sick of Google and Samsung hogging all of the attention. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re passionate about AI-powered software features; you want over five years of OS updates in your device; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 easily earned a spot in our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2024 (so far), thanks in part to its blend of stylish, sophisticated design, high-powered performance, and epic battery life with lightning-fast charging. You get the efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor straight out of the box and four years of OS updates guaranteed, plus OnePlus has continued to dramatically upgrade its camera tech with every new release. </p><p>One bit of bad news is that Best Buy isn&apos;t offering any trade-in credit with this deal, so if you&apos;re planning to recycle an old device, you may want to look elsewhere. If you aren&apos;t picky about the brand, it&apos;s worth noting that there are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-8a-deals-how-to-buy">Pixel 8a preorder offers</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> floating around for folks who are trying to trade in. </p>

<p><em>Is the price of the OnePlus 12 still too steep for your budget?

<hr>
<p>Samsung is finally starting to roll out its May security patch for its latest Galaxy S24 series for U.S.-based users.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theonecid/status/1788540681289453929">TheOneCID</a> spotted the update&apos;s rollout on X, who posted a screenshot of Samsung&apos;s official changelog (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s24-may-2024-security-update-usa/">SamMobile</a>). Owners of a Galaxy S24, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">S24 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a> should begin picking up the update marked as build number AXD3. The tipster&apos;s patch arrived at around 518MB, meaning others can expect similar download sizes.</p><p>Yet again, Samsung&apos;s provided patch notes are quite lackluster. Aside from device stability and improvements, the company doesn&apos;t explicitly state what the May update contains.</p><p>Additionally, it seems that T-Mobile customers are the first to pick up the update.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">mobile security</a> details various bug fixes it implemented for Galaxy devices. The company states that three are for "Critical" level bugs, while 26 are for "High."</p><p>Samsung looked to correct a bug that enabled attackers to take control of a user&apos;s unlocked device "for a while."</p><p>More importantly, a fix has come in for a bug that allowed hackers to access a user&apos;s Secure Folder without entering the appropriate authentication information. Samsung&apos;s FactoryCamera had an issue that allowed attackers to take photos using a user&apos;s device without permission.</p>

It&apos;s speculated that the patch could take place in June and hopefully fix some funky telephoto issues and off-white balance.</p><p>It also seems that Samsung has kicked off its internal development/testing of One UI 7, based on Android 15. A new firmware was spotted on the company&apos;s servers, and the slight change in characteristics may indicate a brand-new OS. Testing has reportedly started on the Galaxy S24 Ultra in Europe.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has been spotted testing a new feature for Chrome that could give users more agency over its Memory Saver.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://windowsreport.com/new-chrome-feature-might-help-you-change-the-number-of-active-inactive-tabs-more-aggressively/">Windows Report</a>, the upcoming option<strong> </strong>will reportedly let users customize how "aggressive" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-performance-modes">Memory Saver</a> is for active and inactive tabs. Further digging showed that Chrome will display three options to users: moderate, balanced, and maximum. Moderate is said to strike a "balance" between the memory a tab is using and keeping "recently accessed" tabs active.</p><p>However, this entry option will make tabs inactive after a "long period of time."</p><p>Chrome&apos;s code shows that the Moderate and Maximum settings progressively shorten users&apos; time to keep tabs active. Regarding the latter, the publication notes that a tab&apos;s active time is much shorter, meaning users will likely face more tab reloading if chosen.</p><p>Maximum could be useful, especially if users use their computer&apos;s memory elsewhere for programs.</p><p>Tabs marked as "inactive" by Chrome&apos;s Memory Saver are seemingly in for a visual update. After enabling the appropriate flags, a new "inactive tabs appearance" settings toggle was discovered. Google&apos;s early description states that such tabs will have a circular dotted icon to encapsulate the site&apos;s icon.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear when Google plans to roll out these customization options for Chrome&apos;s Memory Saver function. Developers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5527519">Chromium</a> have mentioned updates for certain UI elements, meaning we&apos;re likely a bit of a way out from seeing it.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the only test Google is conducting for the sake of Chrome&apos;s health. It was spotted a couple of days ago that the browser is experimenting with a new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-may-introduce-browser-health-performance-panel">Browser Health</a>" option. Early signs show the feature will be tossed into a dedicated "performance" panel in the main Chrome side menu.</p><p>It seems Google will offer health analytics for a user&apos;s browser, offering CPU and memory recommendations for improvement. Memory Saver and Battery Saver are said to join the upcoming Browser Health page when it rolls out.</p>

Fans salivated at the idea of being able to play Batman again after so many years — especially after the disappointment that was Suicide Squad — but this upcoming release changed one major thing: it was a VR-only game.</p><p>What transpired is one of the more juvenile things I&apos;ve seen in the video game industry lately — something that&apos;s saying a lot, given the behavior you can find from fanboys and forum warriors roaming social media. As of this writing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpN_Abd1RQc">the trailer</a> for Batman: Arkham Shadow has over 1.6 million views, 31K likes, and 110K <strong>dislikes</strong>.</p>

<p>The comments are filled with the notion that a VR Batman game is the worst idea of all time and that WB will blame fans when it doesn&apos;t sell well. The problem with this logic is that Warner Brothers isn&apos;t paying the bill this time around. This is a first-party Oculus Studios game, funded entirely by Meta and developed by the folks behind the superb <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/iron-man-vr-review-for-quest-this-is-what-it-feels-like-to-be-a-super-hero">Iron Man VR</a>, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> you can play today.</p><p>For some reason, a subset of gamers thinks that the existence of VR games means that non-VR games will cease to exist if VR continues to grow the way it has. We&apos;ve seen this sort of nonsense before back in the Wii days, where "hardcore gamers" on forums regularly complained about "waggle games" and how they were poisoning traditional gaming.</p><p>They were wrong then and they&apos;re wrong now. There&apos;s plenty of room for every niche and interest in the massive video game market, and it&apos;s just one of many reasons why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-will-never-replace-traditional-gaming-and-thats-perfectly-fine">VR isn&apos;t a replacement for flat games</a>. It&apos;s just a new way to game.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> is one of the more prominent upcoming Meta Quest 3-exclusive games and it showcases the continued interest in creating AAA-tier experiences for VR headsets. But criticism from "fans" of the Arkham series has been utterly tone-deaf and uneducated.</p><p>The existence of Arkham Shadow has no bearing on Rocksteady&apos;s development of a new non-VR Arkham game. Rocksteady is the developer of the original Batman Arkham games, which were all published (and paid for) by WB. Likewise, other high-profile <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> like Metro Awakening and Alien: Rogue Incursion are all developed by VR-only developers and funded by VR publishers.</p><p>In other words, VR development is a silo that operates on its own. It&apos;s not impeded or affected by non-VR game development, and it isn&apos;t somehow taking away a new entry in a series from fans who just want more of the same thing on a new system.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>VR development is a silo that operates on its own. It's not impeded or affected by non-VR game development and isn't preventing publishers from making new non-VR versions of games like Batman.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These games quite literally wouldn&apos;t exist at all if it weren&apos;t for headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. There was never a time when any of the aforementioned games were being developed as a non-VR game and were somehow switched to being VR-only somewhere along the lines.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aQ5aFnSumSiu7cXTAtp2cP" name="Iron-Man-VR-screenshot-03.png" alt="Iron Man VR screenshot from the Meta Quest 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aQ5aFnSumSiu7cXTAtp2cP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Camouflaj)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this makes me wonder if these so-called "fans" are actually fans at all. As a fan of Star Wars, I jumped at the idea of being able to wield a Lightsaber <em>myself</em> instead of just watching some generic character on a TV do it. Actually having a chance to <em>be</em> Tony Stark in Iron Man VR and fly around in the suit was downright incredible and a literal dream come true in every way.</p><p>So, wouldn&apos;t true fans jump at the opportunity to finally be able to say "I&apos;m Batman" while wearing the suit and beating up bad guys in the streets of Gotham themselves? I certainly would think so.</p>

<p>Praying for sanity from fanboys is never a winning battle, but it would be nice to see a little more thought put behind the words and actions of trigger-happy gamers. Directing your anger toward a project you don&apos;t like is fruitless and only causes more anger, not positive change.</p><p>The Helldivers 2 incident over this past weekend is a perfect example of how gamers should and shouldn&apos;t respond to a problem. When Sony mandated that a PSN account be used on a game people have been playing for months, it quite literally made it impossible for some people to continue playing the game, as PSN is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/country-selector/index.html">unavailable in 121 countries</a>.</p><p>Some outspoken gamers directed their anger toward the game&apos;s developers when the actual problem was the game&apos;s publisher, Sony Interactive Entertainment. Sony got the message when the game got a negative review and bombed into oblivion on Steam over the weekend, but the harsh and often inappropriate language used in online forums and social media geared toward the developers is downright unacceptable, and it needs to change.</p>
<h2 id="is-hybrid-aaa-a-better-way-2">Is hybrid AAA a better way?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="2c68yQ9nDkQQkHkihmcPXJ" name="resident-evil-4-remake-vr-mode.jpeg" alt="Resident Evil 4 VR Mode logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2c68yQ9nDkQQkHkihmcPXJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1918" height="1079" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Capcom)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more interesting critiques I&apos;ve seen online is that Rocksteady and Oculus Studios should have worked together to develop a hybrid version of this game that supports both flat-screen consoles and PCs and offers a VR mode for those who want to experience it that way.</p><p>It&apos;s a method we&apos;ve seen a few times recently, most notably with last year&apos;s PS5 releases of Resident Evil 4 HD, Resident Evil 8, and Gran Turismo 7, which all offer the full game playable in either VR on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-ps-vr2-review">PSVR 2</a> or on a TV in non-VR mode. Sony&apos;s release of the PSVR 2 was predicated on the idea that more of these hybrid AAA games would help further VR development while still offering something to non-VR gamers.</p><p>If I can get behind any kind of compromise, this would certainly be it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If they're not done right, hybrid games can "feel like a hotdog in a hamburger bun. Yes they are playable, but it just isn’t right."</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Every game can&apos;t be developed with a hybrid model, though. I talked to Andrew Eiche, CEO of Owlchemy Labs, about the situation. Owlchemy is the developer behind Job Simulator, one of the biggest VR hits, and he agrees that hybrid AAA could work with some caveats.</p><p>"To me, the "hybrid" approach seems to break a few different ways," Eiche told me in an email. "One is a hasty port of existing content slapped into the headset. It lets the studio say they shipped on VR and allows them to sometimes be high on a platform chart that doesn&apos;t differentiate between VR-only and VR-supported titles. It probably gives them a jolt of revenue for the initial launch. These games feel like a hotdog in a hamburger bun. Yes, they are playable, but it just isn&apos;t right."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vU877isG2AqjgVkmiDeKe7" name="Assassins-Creed-Nexus-screenshot-boston-crowds.jpg" alt="Walking through crowds anonymously in Boston in Assassin's Creed Nexus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vU877isG2AqjgVkmiDeKe7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something like Beat Saber makes no sense without VR controllers acting as Lightsabers. Likewise, while you can add a VR mode to any game imaginable as proven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/flat2vr-studios-hires-talented-vr-modders-for-licensed-quest-ports">the Flat2VR team</a>, doing so doesn&apos;t always equate to a better game.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There are times when I just want to sit on a couch and twiddle my thumbs in front of a TV.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This sort of tactic can work beautifully, particularly when trying to breathe new life into classic games. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/jedi-knight-2-quest-sale">VR port of Jedi Knight II</a> is a perfect example of this, and it makes playing through this classic PC shooter even more fun than the original release because it lets you become the character. It&apos;s an experience we might never have been able to have if it weren&apos;t for the efforts of Team Beef.</p><p>But there are times when I just want to sit on a couch and twiddle my thumbs in front of a TV. Whether it&apos;s been a particularly hard day, or maybe I&apos;m feeling sick and don&apos;t want to move around much, there&apos;s always going to be a place for non-VR games.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToM-wz3v-NU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Wouldn&apos;t it be cool, then, to be able to play through a game exactly how you want, no matter how you&apos;re feeling that day? I might enjoy playing through most of a game in VR mode but could occasionally decide to plop down on the couch and play it on a flat screen if I&apos;m feeling tired or lazy.</p><p>Whatever the way, AAA games can be an important way to bring in dedicated gamers who are willing to spend big bucks on high-profile titles.</p><p>Eiche agrees and notes that "there absolutely needs to be a place for AAA games in VR! Let me be clear about what I am saying: There needs to be space for titles with large budgets and ambitious scope in VR. If the medium is going to be a mainstream success, the industry must be able to support a variety of titles. The current console industry is able to do this and is arguably smaller than what VR aspires to be."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some gamers seem to be allergic to the idea of trying anything new or different.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So maybe hybrid AAA will be the best path forward for big games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ubisoft-sales-expectations-assassins-creed-vr">Assassin&apos;s Creed Nexus</a> — a game that didn&apos;t meet sales expectations from a big publisher that&apos;s used to raking in hundreds of millions of dollars for big releases.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note, though, that VR games require bespoke mechanics to work properly in some cases. "It is mutually beneficial for VR and AAA games to embrace VR, but VR cannot be seen as a simple porting job," Eiche said. "It must be treated as a separate medium and experiences need to be developed to embrace what makes VR so special!"</p><p>Having a dedicated VR team within the larger development team of an upcoming AAA title could be a way for big publishers to increase game sales without investing in VR-only development. This year&apos;s crop of VR-only AAA titles will certainly be a barometer of potential success, and if they don&apos;t sell as well as hoped, hybrid VR development is the next best path.</p><p>After all, some gamers seem to be allergic to the idea of trying anything new or different. This could be the way to make the largest number of gamers happy while still doing something new and different <em>and</em> supporting healthier development cycles financially.</p>

As usual, the event takes place in mid-May, which is fast approaching. As usual, we expect many fun and interesting announcements from this year&apos;s Google I/O 2024 event, with a lot of software and hopefully some new hardware to show off.</p><p>Google will host a live keynote and a number of sessions and workshops that users can pop in and out of. The event will give us the best idea of what Google has in store for Android, Search, AI, Wear OS, and tons more. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/explore/">schedule</a> has already been shared, giving us a good look at what to expect, but we don&apos;t have all the details. Still, we can make a good guess about what some of the biggest announcements will be.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-google-i-o-2024-2">When is Google I/O 2024?</h2>
<p>Google I/O 2024 begins on May 14, 2024, with the opening keynote starting at 10 a.m. PT. The event will be presented live from the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, but it will also be simultaneously livestreamed for anyone who can&apos;t be present at the event. To find out how to watch, check the next section.</p>

<p>To take part in the Google I/O developer conference, you must <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2024/">register on the website</a> to create a developer profile. Doing so is free, and it will allow you to stay up-to-date with relevant news and content. You don&apos;t <em>need</em> to register to view the sessions or the keynote, but it&apos;s recommended if you want the full experience or want to create a developer profile for additional benefits.</p><p>For the keynote, check out the video linked above to set a reminder so that you don&apos;t miss out on the biggest announcements of Google I/O. The sessions will be available on the I/O website and may likely be posted on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google">Google&apos;s YouTube channel</a> following the event.</p>
<h2 id="android-15-2">Android 15</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg" name="android-15-logo-highlight.jpg" alt="Android 15 logo on Pixel 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WymQhvqn9KZWMgDvhbDvdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a brief developer preview phase, the next version of Android is currently being beta-tested on eligible Pixel smartphones. This gives us a good idea of what to expect in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, but Google will likely go into detail on what features and changes we can expect when the stable update rolls out later this year.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect much in the way of visual upgrades, with the last major change introduced in Android 12 with Material You. Android 15 continues to build on that by further optimizing the software and refining/adding features.</p><p>One new feature we&apos;ve spotted in the beta that has us very excited is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-excited-about-android-15-audio-sharing-feature">Audio Sharing</a>. This feature seems to be based on Auracast and allows users to broadcast their audio from their device to multiple others. Samsung phones have long featured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-dual-audio-on-a-samsung-phone">Dual Audio</a>, so this should be a fun evolution of that.</p><p>Other features include partial screen recordings that only show an individual app, taskbar and continuity updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, a handy notification cooldown function, a higher-quality webcam mode for Pixels, and more.</p>
<h2 id="pixels-2">Pixels</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k" name="google-pixel-8a-colors-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8a all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXQfgQcni7RQ8esY58Vk9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2023-biggest-announcements">Last year&apos;s Google I/O</a> brought with it a few hardware announcements. The Pixel 7a impressed us with its improved display, Tensor G2, and incredible value. However, this year, Google decided not to wait for I/O and instead <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-8a-packs-just-as-much-ai-punch-as-the-standard-pixel-8">announced the Pixel 8a</a> a week before the event. The phone brings an even better display, the latest Tensor chip, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, all at the same $499 price tag.</p><p>Google also had new Pixel Tablet news, although probably not what you were expecting. Instead of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a>, Google announced that it&apos;s now selling the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/pixel-tablet-solo-launch-announcement">Pixel Tablet without the dock</a>, bringing the price down to just $399. It&apos;s a small change, and we&apos;re still waiting for a first-party keyboard and stylus, but hopefully, we&apos;ll get more news at I/O and maybe even a glimpse of the next iteration.</p><p>We also got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> announcement at I/O 2023, so it&apos;s possible we could see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Fold 2</a> at I/O, although Google may wait to launch its next foldable later in the year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wear-os-5-2">Wear OS 5</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6PyGvvbynS4SbCMDtYo4J8" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-wearing-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PyGvvbynS4SbCMDtYo4J8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One announcement we weren&apos;t expecting is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-schedule-teases-wear-os-5-what-that-means">Wear OS 5</a>. While we knew it was likely we&apos;d see an update to Wear OS, we didn&apos;t think it would be a full version jump, as we have previously been treated to partial jumps. It&apos;s a pretty big deal, even if we don&apos;t yet have the full details on what to expect from the update. Google says it will talk about the evolution of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format</a>, but besides that, we&apos;re in the dark for now.</p><p>We expect the update will first roll out on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watch series before the Pixel Watch models get it later this year, and Samsung will likely add its own goodies into the mix. We&apos;ll also be curious to see what other devices will be eligible for the update, although it will likely be those powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 platform</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ai-in-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-2">AI in everything, everywhere, all at once</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems like yesterday, ChatGPT was the big new thing. Now, generative AI is everywhere, and it seems like we can&apos;t go a day without hearing about it. Rest assured, Google will have a lot to say about it at I/O (in case you&apos;re looking to start a drinking game of some sort). The company will likely have plenty of new AI features coming to Search, Chrome, Maps, and its various other software services. </p>
<h2 id="other-google-i-o-announcements-we-expect-2">Other Google I/O announcements we expect</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wiYEJiEz4z2eKoNkrp89LX" name="Project-Iris-hero.jpeg" alt="Various VR and AR headsets with the Google logo in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wiYEJiEz4z2eKoNkrp89LX.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The I/O schedule is quite expansive, so there will be plenty to get into during the conference. One of the things we expect to see or at least hear more about is Google&apos;s XR platform, which is expected to power an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">upcoming Samsung headset</a>. It&apos;s unclear if this will actually be talked about during the event, but we feel like it&apos;s highly likely, especially in the wake of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/accessories/these-ray-ban-sunglasses-have-cameras-and-ai-but-you-should-just-wait-for-apple-glass-instead">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>.</p><p>Google is also said to have its own smart glasses in the works, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-smart-glasses-google-io-2022">showed off the Iris concept</a> at I/O 2022, so maybe we&apos;ll see how that&apos;s evolved since then.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tPpA5xXeGoyYP5xjEfA4hi" name="Google-io-2022-google-glass-translate-02.jpg" alt="The new Google smart glasses teased at Google I/O 2022" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPpA5xXeGoyYP5xjEfA4hi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also hope to hear more about Google&apos;s plans for fitness. The company signaled the death of Google Fit when Fitbit was made the de-factor app on the Pixel Watch, and recently put another nail in its coffin with the announcement that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">moving away from the Google Fit API</a>. Now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> and the Android Health Platform, we&apos;re hoping Google can shed some light on how exactly it all comes together, especially as it relates to wearables.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope to learn about what Google is doing with smart home. We haven&apos;t had a new smart display in a while, and rumors indicate we could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/possible-nest-hub-max-refresh-spotted">new Nest Hub Max</a> and Nest Audio soon, which would help reinvigorate the company&apos;s smart home efforts in a way that the Pixel Tablet couldn&apos;t really do.</p>

<p>Android Central will be present at Google I/O for any firsthand content. We will also have a live blog during the keynote so that you can stay up to date on the latest announcements as they happen. Be sure to tune in on May 14 for our live coverage!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Messages app in beta brings handy new features from the November 2023 announcement.</li><li>They include voice moods accompanied by an audio recorder redesign.</li><li>Users can also see the new noise cancellation feature as part of the interface redesign.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Beta users of the Google Messages app are seeing voice moods roll out alongside a redesign of the audio recorder interface, which features noise cancellation, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/05/06/google-messages-recorder-redesign-voice-moods/">9to5Google</a>. </p><p>In November 2023, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gain-one-billion-active-rcs-users">announced</a> some exciting new features for its messages as part of the celebration of one billion RCS users. The voice moods on the messaging app were part of this, and they are now seeing a broader rollout.</p><p>Previously, users were accustomed to long-pressing the voice memo button, which opened up the traditional “Slide to cancel” interface. However, the new one in the beta version has been revamped with a new Material You-inspired design.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="K6N3FHHaPxCBwtqDxyeqRC" name="google-messsages-audio-recorder-redesign.jpg" alt="Google Messages audio recorder new interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6N3FHHaPxCBwtqDxyeqRC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Dgae4Y6BPiRaMRVcAJR5LC" name="google-messages-audio-recorder-interface-redesign.jpg" alt="Google Messages audio recorder new interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dgae4Y6BPiRaMRVcAJR5LC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Users can notice “Tap to record your voice” aided by the microphone icon, cancel, and attach buttons. When users start recording, they can see the “Noise Cancellation” button, which can be turned on or off, per requirement. </p><p>While the feature helps turn off background noises for recording, Google says the improvements in overall audio quality can also be seen due to increased sampling and bit rate.</p><p>On the other hand, the new voice moods are added from the aforementioned new interface wherein users can pick from nine voice moods accompanied by relevant emojis, which can be added by clicking the attach button.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ETZqr4U9PSUHwb5tyQCsum" name="Google-Messages-voice-mood-1.jpg" alt="Setting a voice memo mood in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETZqr4U9PSUHwb5tyQCsum.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="939" height="939" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="gGkpAT2qrJXJ8VgWecoJ2n" name="Google-Messages-voice-mood-2.jpg" alt="Setting a voice memo mood in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gGkpAT2qrJXJ8VgWecoJ2n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="940" height="940" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>Users then would see a gradient emoji background added to the waveform for the interface, as mentioned. The same card will be sent as a message to the recipient with all the emoji and wallpaper stuff. </p><p>It is encouraging to see Google Messages finally seeing the nifty new interface amongst other announced features from last year. The features, such as the redesigned audio recorder interface, can be seen on the latest Google Messages beta bearing <strong>20240501_RC00</strong> version. </p><p>However, as 9to5 points out, the voice moods rollout doesn’t appear as extensive as the interface. However, we could see the rollout soon, followed by the official rollout in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>I&apos;ve been using the Our Groceries Shopping List app for years and love it. Being able to create categories of different store items to make the shopping trip more efficient is wonderful.</p><p>My wife and I use Our Groceries Shopping List to add items to our lists independently, then we can easily see the singular list while at the store. With integration for Google Assistant and Wear OS, I can&apos;t imagine using anything else.</p>

<p>Amazon Kindle pulls ahead of the pack with a huge library of content, including free e-books and content from indie publishers that you can read on your mobile device or desktop with the Kindle app. There is bound to be a book out there for you, no matter what genre you are looking for.</p>
<p>In the app, you can also customize fonts, margins, line spacing, and also organize the books you&apos;ve downloaded into collections so that it&apos;s easier to find the one you want to read. Kindle will also remember the page that you left reading on when you switch devices. This means that you can switch between your phone, tablet, and PC without ever losing your page in the process. Or you can simply get something like the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Amazon Kindle Scribe</a>, which is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle" target="_blank">best Amazon Kindle e-readers</a>, and go back and forth between it and your smartphone.</p>
<p>The Kindle app is so versatile that you can even have other reading pieces sent to the app, such as articles saved in Instapaper. You can also sign up for the Kindle Unlimited and get access to more than one million titles for $11.99 per month.</p>

<p>While the ability to purchase books from a major retailer and download them all to your phone is awesome, sometimes the books you want to read are ones that you already have in digital form. Whether you&apos;ve picked up e-books from an independent publisher, or you&apos;ve gotten the files from a now-defunct program, being able to open and read them properly is key, and that&apos;s where Moon+ Reader comes in.</p>
<p>This app is lightweight, easy to use, and very straightforward. I personally prefer this over the Kindle app on my Android devices. It has support for more than 10 different file formats, from RAR all the way to EPUB. On top of that, you can customize the way words look on the screen, back up your library online, and get access to five auto-scroll options apart from plenty of fantastic features. With the ability to view content in various formats, it&apos;s easy to understand why Moon+ Reader is one of the best Android apps, and not just among the best e-book apps for Android.</p>

<p>Many e-book publishers for Android limit you to only using their apps to read and enjoy content. Moon+ Reader throws that out of the window and makes it so you can enjoy just about any e-book, regardless of the format it was downloaded in.</p>

<p>Long gone are the days when you needed to head out to your local library just to get some new books to read. Thanks to the digital world and apps like Libby, your library is now available with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>If you live near a participating library, Libby opens up your world to a variety of new books at your fingertips. There are standard books that can be "checked out" easily along with audiobooks, and both of these can be saved for offline use so you can read them even if you don&apos;t have an internet connection.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy reading on a Kindle, Libby makes it simple to check out a book, and then easily send it over to a reading device. The app has all the expected options for customization, so you can read right from the app and even take notes. Did you just come across a word you&apos;ve never seen before? Libby will be able to even define it for you from the app, making it so you don&apos;t have to open another app in the middle of an intense chapter.</p>

<p>Libby, by OverDrive, is an app that works with your local library to give you access to your favorite books. While it's surely fun to actually go to the library, sometimes it's just not feasible. Also, with Libby, you won't have to worry about those pesky late fees.</p>

<p>Google Play Books gives you access to a wide range of books, some of which are free. You&apos;ll also find some textbooks, although we&apos;d like to see the textbook selection improve. You can read books offline, use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words, and have your notes and place in a book saved across multiple devices through your Google account.</p>
<p>If you have a family account set up, then you can share books between everybody without having to purchase them multiple times. Staying within the Google ecosystem also makes it easy to share your purchases with family members and keep all of your media in one place.</p>

<p>Google's Play Books app is one of those apps that doesn't get as much attention as other e-book apps for Android. Still, Google has done a wonderful job at combining a catalog of endless selections with a solid reading experience, right on your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Kobo has been around for quite some time and is now a part of Rakuten, but that hasn&apos;t stopped it from being great. This app is a great way of reading your favorite e-books whether they&apos;re on your phone or tablet. It has a gigantic selection filled with both new and established authors, including magazines and children&apos;s books. The most popular and trending e-books are even updated hourly so you won&apos;t miss an amazing story, even when it&apos;s coming from an author you&apos;ve never heard of.</p>
<p>As you begin to buy books and Kobo learns your preferences, it will build up a list of recommendations having suggestions for new books or magazines. There is also an awesome reading activity feature that&apos;ll show you how much time you&apos;ve spent while reading in the app, what books you are currently reading, a running tally of how many books you&apos;ve read, and even how many pages you&apos;ve turned in the process.</p>

<p>PocketBook is another one of those apps that make it easy to read books, regardless of what format they&apos;re in. The app supports more than 25 different formats, making it possible for you to read magazines and comic books, or even listen to your favorite audiobooks.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit to PocketBook over similar apps has everything to do with cloud syncing. PocketBook Cloud will synchronize your progress for anything uploaded to the app, so you can start reading something on your phone, only to pick it up right where you left off in a browser. You can even sync files from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cloud-storage-service">cloud storage services</a> like Dropbox and Google Drive, if you don&apos;t want to manually upload the books to your phone.</p>

<p>While Amazon has always been an online-only store, Barnes & Noble has been one of the largest bookstores still hanging around. To try and keep up with the times, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/barnes-and-noble-nook-10-inch-hd-tablet-lenovo">unveiled a series of e-readers</a> a few years back. Following that unsuccessful attempt, Barnes & Noble has now largely pivoted to the NOOK app. Like the Kindle app, you can browse a vast library of titles, genres, and much more right from your smartphone.</p>
<p>After finding a new book to settle down with, you can customize different aspects of the reading experience. This includes adjusting the font style, changing the margins, and even switching up the page animations. As you might expect, you can also make notes and add bookmarks that can then be shared with your friends if you come across an inspiring quote or just something funny. The NOOK app is free to use and includes more than 75,000 free e-books, or you can start building your digital library by purchasing e-books.</p>

<p>NOOK comes from a time when the traditional bookstore was still popular, but Barnes & Noble has evolved and recognized our smartphones make for the perfect portable library. NOOK includes thousands of free e-books but can also be used to check out magazines or to purchase new e-books.</p>

<p>Goodreads isn&apos;t an app to read your favorite e-books. Instead, it&apos;s a social community for everyone who enjoys reading and sharing book recommendations and ratings. Sometimes it&apos;s not always feasible for you to be able to catch up with your friends and family about what new books they are enjoying. That&apos;s where Goodreads comes into the foray, as this app makes it easy to see what your friends are reading and what they think of those books. It is an excellent place to find something new to read — something I can vouch for as a decade-old user.</p>
<p>You can create lists however you like, including books that you want to pick up later. You can also find recommendations based on your reading lists and read reviews. Then there are exciting challenges that you can set for yourself to achieve and share them with your community. Goodreads is a must-have app for every dedicated reader.</p>

<p>If you're someone who reads a lot of books, you may run out of ideas on where to find the next one. Goodreads changes that as this is a community-driven app where you can find and share opinions and ratings for books with both family and friends.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is debuting the new G Stylus 5G for 2024, upgraded with an improved pen experience and a bolstered premium design for $399.</p><p>As stated in its press release, the Moto G Stylus takes its capabilities further with a 6.7-inch pOLED display that rocks a 120Hz refresh rate. Motorola adds that the device&apos;s Full HD Plus resolution makes what you see feel brighter, sharper, and clearer. Moreover, the company is touting the phone&apos;s multitasking abilities, stating users can take notes while binge-watching a show.</p><p>Speaking of the stylus, the device&apos;s larger contact area and improved software is said to enhance the pen&apos;s mobility for a smoother experience. Motorola has implemented a new UI when using stylus-specific features. Additionally, users can add an array of "favorite apps" for the pen that will appear when it&apos;s taken out.</p><p>The overall design of the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is another talking point. The company states that its back panel is crafted with vegan leather. The post adds that those looking for a phone at a reduced price won&apos;t have to "compromise design."</p><p>Shielding the front of the device is Corning&apos;s Gorilla Glass 3, alongside an IP52 water-repellent rating.</p>

<p>Furthering this is the phone&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 6 Gen 1</a> SoC from Qualcomm.</p><p>Similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">last year&apos;s edition</a>, the 2024 G Stylus 5G boasts a vertical dual-camera array. The post states that the "versatile" setup contains a 50MP primary lens with an f/1.8 aperture and Ultra Pixel technology. The company adds that such improvements should aid the camera&apos;s light sensitivity.</p><p>OIS (optical image stabilization) helps keep our shots steady when moving. The main lens is joined by a 13MP ultrawide camera with 120-degree FOV capabilities. The front contains a 32MP centered punch-hole selfie camera.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the latest G Stylus offers a large 5,000mAh battery expected to give consumers over a day&apos;s worth of energy. Charging cycles are handled by its 30W TurboPower when wired and 15W when charged wirelessly. Motorola suspects the device can obtain enough power "for the day" in just thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Users will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box. Internally, the device is offered in the following RAM/storage configurations: 8/128GB and 8/256GB. However, the Moto G Stylus features a slot for a microSD card, meaning users can expand their storage by up to 2TB.</p><p>The NFC-capable device sports a 3.5mm headset jack, USB-C port, and Bluetooth 5.1 support.</p><p>For U.S. consumers, Motorola states the G Stylus 5G 2024 is available "universally unlocked" at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and its website (motorola.com). Users can grab the new phone on May 30 for $399 in Scarlet Wave and Caramel Latte. Folks in Canada can grab the phone for CAD 499 on the same date as U.S. consumers.</p><p>The company adds that there are plans to bring the device to more services such as Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Boost Infinite, Boost Mobile, Consumer Cellular, UScellular, Google Fi Wireless, and more "in the coming weeks."</p>
