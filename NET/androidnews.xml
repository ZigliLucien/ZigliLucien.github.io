I currently own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-review">Galaxy Watch 5</a>, but I kick myself for not waiting to get the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which is why I&apos;m happy to see this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C791819Q">Prime Day sale</a> on last year&apos;s smartwatch.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> normally retails for a whopping $399 for the 43mm Bluetooth/Wi-Fi model, but you can get nearly $100 on Prime Day, although your time to snag this price is obviously limited. A similar deal is also available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C79181HB">LTE version of this watch</a>, although you&apos;d pay a little more if you want cellular connectivity.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic may be last year&apos;s model, but the watch is sort of in a league of its own with no direct successor. The watch features an upgraded chip, great performance, and tons of health and fitness tracking features. However, the best part about the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is the rotating bezel, which lets you easily navigate Wear OS menus with minimal input on the touch screen.</p><p>Neither the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> nor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> feature a rotating bezel—or even a rotating crown, for that matter—which is kind of a bummer, given how popular this feature is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung smartwatches</a>. And given how expensive the Galaxy Watch Ultra is (it costs as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>), anyone looking for a relatively "affordable" (I use that word loosely) flagship smartwatch might want to look at last year&apos;s model instead.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a premium smartwatch but don&apos;t want to spend an arm and a leg for the latest Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don&apos;t care about rotating bezels and would rather have a smartwatch with multi-day battery life.</p>
<p>In addition, you can also go for the non-Classic model, as there&apos;s a pretty sweet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/dont-wait-for-my-galaxy-watch-7-review-buy-this-galaxy-watch-6-deal-before-prime-day-ends">Galaxy Watch 6 Prime Day deal</a> right now.

The 55-inch LG C3 Series OLED evo 4K TV, which we named the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-4k-tvs-chromecast">best overall 4K TV for Chromecast</a>, is downright stunning, and you can grab it at a 15% discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVXF72HV?th=1"><strong>down from $1,296.99 to $1,096.99</strong></a>. That’s $200 shaved off the price that you can use to pay for a streaming subscription plan for an entire year, maybe even longer.</p><p>What’s so special about this TV? First off, it’s a sizeable 55 inches with an OLED panel, which offers the deepest blacks, brightest whites, and more lifelike imagery than you’ll find in any other type of TV. With the 120Hz refresh rate, a9 AI processor Gen6, and ultra-slim design, it fits in just about any room of the home.</p>

<p>A gorgeous TV for the living room, den, bedroom, or basement, the LG C3 Series OLED evo 4K is a great first entry into the OLED space. It boasts a fast processor, AI intelligence features, 120Hz refresh rate, and sleek design that makes it look like a painting or photo frame when you aren’t watching TV. This deal is a pretty good one to save a few hundred bucks on one of the best you can buy if you’re in the market for a new TV.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVXF72HV?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8b07315a-a4f9-4c85-89e3-8b6d621c6d34" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="LG C3 Series OLED evo 4K TV:" data-dimension48="LG C3 Series OLED evo 4K TV:">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>Recommended if: </strong>You’re looking for a decent-sized TV for a primary or secondary viewing room and you’re going to use it in a room that doesn’t get too bright during viewing hours. </p><p><strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You want a larger-sized TV, a newer model, or you’re on a tight budget.</p><p>Along with the stunning picture, you get LG’s webOS smart TV interface, by far my favorite of any TV platform. It’s so intuitive, provides instant access to all your favorite streaming apps, photo libraries, and even LG’s own free channels. The Quick Cards make it easy to categorize apps and quickly call up favorite ones, whether it’s for fitness, gaming, or streaming TV. It comes with the Magic Remote that even has quick buttons to access the most popular streaming services. </p>

Are you so impatient that you&apos;re willing to pay double for your smartwatch? </p><p>Look, the double-pinch and knock-on Universal Gestures are cool — and I&apos;ll gush about them in the review — but they&apos;re not $140 cool. </p>

<p>After a full year of use and abuse — including wearing it to bed almost every night — my own Galaxy Watch 6 has no damage and no performance slowdowns to speak of. It&apos;s been a trooper, and thank goodness, because I am a depressed, ADHD scatterbrain who will otherwise forget that phone notifications even exist. When I&apos;m gaming or reading, my Galaxy Watch 6 ensures that even if the notifications are hidden from my phone screen, they&apos;re still front and center on my wrist.</p><p>Both watches look the same on the surface, and the only external change is actually in the Watch 6&apos;s favor. See, when you forget to charge the Watch 6 — and if you wear your watch to bed like I do, you absolutely will — you can turn on reverse wireless charging on your Galaxy S-series or Z-series phone and charge the watch using the phone as an impromptu cradle. The Watch 7 has a curvier <del>bottom</del> sensor array, and that few millimeters of extra distance precludes it from working with reverse wireless charging. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Rj2HbGVfYtuV8N6etzrJSH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-vs-6-3.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left, black) and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (right, silver) side-by-side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rj2HbGVfYtuV8N6etzrJSH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Behold the smartwatch embodiment of The Office's "They're the same picture" meme. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both watches use the same 2,000-nit screens. Both use Samsung Health for subscription-free fitness tracking. And while it&apos;ll take a few weeks/months, Samsung confirmed that the Galaxy Watch 6 is getting almost every software feature that the Galaxy Watch 7 does.</p><p>So unless you are the most impatient early adopter around, cut your watch costs in half and use that money for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-and-watch-6-classic-watch-bands">better watch band</a>. If your wrist is as narrow as mine is, the in-box band&apos;s sculpting around the lugs will make for an awkward fit. You can fix that with any plain-old 20mm watch strap, but it&apos;s Prime Day, so treat yourself to a couple of nice ones. My set of silicone straps, like the "best multipack" Lerobo, has held up beautifully over the last three years, but Samsung&apos;s official fabric band is so comfortable that I bought the Lavender myself after reviewing the cream-colored one.</p>

<p>Whatsapp has been making several changes to its platform in the past couple of weeks, and the latest is one to be happy about. </p><p>According to the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/choose-your-favorites-on-whatsapp">blog post</a>, starting today (July 16) users can choose their favorite contacts or groups on the app, making it easier for users to pull up those they frequently text.</p><p>The "Favorites" option appears like a separate filter that keeps chats with your family group or best friend all under one tab. Whatsapp also added this feature to the calling option, much like the speed dial option on the phone. The favorites picked on the chats tab will reflect on the calls tab as well, so users don&apos;t have to go through their call history or manually search for the people they want to contact. </p><p>To add a contact or group to your favorite list, select the “Favorites” filter from the chats screen or tap the “Add favorite” option after selecting a contact or group from the calls tab. </p><p>Users can also add a chat to their Favorites by tapping and holding on to the chat and selecting “Add to favorite" from the options. The messaging app states that users can manage their favorite contacts and groups by going to <strong>Settings > Favorites > Add to Favorite</strong>. The best part is you can re-arrange the order of these contacts at anytime.</p>

<p>Back in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-24-3-10-70-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a> spotted that Whatsapp was working on introducing a favorite contacts feature in a beta update. Whatsapp currently allows users to pin only three chats to the top of their chat list; however, introducing this Favorites tab will solve this issue easily by letting you choose as many favorite people/groups as you like.</p><p>This feature will be available on iOS and Android versions starting today and will gradually roll out to everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Recently, Whatsapp <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-highlights-calling-experience-updates">announced</a> that the app supports "Speaker spotlight," which highlights the person talking and moves them to the front alongside audio during a screen share. It is also working on another feature called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-could-soon-let-users-create-ai-images-of-themselves" target="_blank">Imagine me</a>," which allows users to create an AI-generated picture of themselves using Meta AI&apos;s chatbot. This is followed by a text prompt that lets the user tweak the image to place themselves in different settings.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I have tested dozens of true wireless earbuds over the years, and the Google Pixel Buds Pro remain one of my favorites. The Bluetooth earbuds are on for a good deal right now through Amazon Prime Day, down from $199.99 to $119.95, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1N7RT74"><strong>40% off the regular price</strong></a>. For a pair of earbuds that rival some models twice the price, this deal is worth jumping on. </p><p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro are two years old, but wireless earbuds don’t age as quickly as other tech, like smartphones and laptops. So, they’re still a solid choice to consider. They feature Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with a Silent Seal that works fabulously to block out surrounding noises, like someone mowing the lawn next door, cars zooming by on your morning run, or background chatter in the airport. Use Transparency Mode when you want to let in some sounds from the outside world and have a bit more situational awareness.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro might be two years old, but they remain one of my favorite true wireless earbuds, like the reliable stuffed animal you always turn back to for comfort. A perfect companion to an Android device, especially a Google Pixel phone, they offer noise cancellation, long battery life, and even come in cool colors. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1N7RT74 " target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4731433e-e1bb-4e0e-9a32-26913ed72448" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Buds Pro: $199.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Buds Pro: $199.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>Recommended if: </strong>You have an Android phone, especially a Google Pixel device, and want an affordable, versatile pair of earbuds you can wear just about anywhere. </p><p><strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the latest and greatest features, and a sleeker, more modern design. </p><p>The custom 11mm speaker drivers and volume EQ afford a wonderful listening experience at any volume. Conversation Detection can even detect when you start speaking to someone, like a flight attendant or server and automatically pauses the audio.</p>

<p>Available in six color options, including playful ones like Coral and Lemongrass, they’re not just great for listening to music, podcasts, movies, and games: you can also make crystal clean voice calls, confident that the beamforming mics will pick up your voice so the person can hear you clearly, no matter where you are.

<p>Our reviewer loved the Google Pixel Buds Pro when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-review">he tested them two years ago</a>. He appreciated the clear audio quality, solid ANC performance, comfortable fit, reliable touch controls, and more. The great thing is that new features can still make their way to these buds via firmware updates, as was the case in October 2023 when Google launched features like faster audio transmissions for gaming and hearing wellness suggestions. </p><p>If you just want a good pair of true wireless earbuds you can count on for a decent price, these are it.

Fortunately, all Horizon models are on sale for Prime Day, scoring you 19% off each finish.

<p>I&apos;ve been using the Oura Ring Gen 3 since 2021, and I absolutely love it. I&apos;ve recommended it to so many of my friends and even convinced Shruti Shekar, Android Central&apos;s EIC, to get one, and she absolutely loves it. Sleep tracking is pretty detailed, and I love the automatic activity detection, which works surprisingly well. The Readiness score brings all your activities and vitals together to help give you insights on how to make the best of your day and take charge of your wellness.</p><p>Keep in mind that Oura requires a subscription for many of its most useful features, so you&apos;ll have to include the $5.99 monthly cost in your calculations. It&apos;s a small price to pay for the membership, but it&apos;s still worth noting. That said, the Oura Ring Gen 3 is FSA/HSA eligible, so you can always use the money set aside in those accounts to pay for the ring.</p><p>Still, Oura <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-app-advisor-labs-test-launch">continues to add more and more features</a> to the Oura Ring Gen 3 and the companion app, and it&apos;s honestly incredible how much this little wearable is capable of.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You&apos;re looking for a low-key wearable to track your vitals and help keep you on top of your wellness without being too distracting.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You don&apos;t want to pay for a monthly subscription or are deeply ingrained into the Samsung ecosystem.</p>
<p>If the exact style doesn&apos;t matter to you, the older Heritage style isn&apos;t on sale for Prime Day, but you can still grab these styles for less than what you&apos;d pay for the Horizon rings. Finishes like black and silver are available to purchase starting from just $299, which is $100 less than what you&apos;d pay for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p>

For me, OnePlus has been the go-to choice in 2024 thanks to the OnePlus 12&apos;s unbelievably good (and eye-friendly) display, its fantastic features, blazing fast speed, and dreamy haptics that feel good with every touch. Thanks to Amazon Prime Day, my favorite phone is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Dual-SIM-Smartphone-Processor-Hasselblad/dp/B0CQ5M1NXQ?th=1"><strong>$300 off</strong></a><strong> </strong>for a limited time!</p><p>You can choose from the sleek black or the unique marble green colorways, as both are discounted for <strong>$100 less than their previous best price</strong>. The OnePlus 12 is a true powerhouse phone and this deal even includes 6 months of Google One and 3 months of Youtube Premium to sweeten it even further! As Harish said in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12 review</a>, it beats the Galaxy S24 where it counts.</p>

<p>You're going to LOVE the OnePlus 12. I sure do! It's my favorite phone of the year and the one I use every day despite reviewing dozens of other phones.

<p>✅<strong>Recommended if: </strong>You&apos;re looking for a phone that&apos;s faster than the rest, plays games at 120FPS, charges lightning fast with 100W wired and 50W wireless charging, lasts for 2 days on a single charge, has the best haptics in the business, and even sports a brilliant OLED display with vision-friendly options.</p><p>❌<strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> You need the best cameras on a smartphone. OnePlus has made great strides over the years but they&apos;re still not as good as the cameras on a Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, or Honor phone.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of all the reasons I use the OnePlus 12 every day, the display is my number one pick. It&apos;s incredibly bright with 4500 nits of peak brightness <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">yet offers important vision-friendly options</a> to protect our eyes. I&apos;m one of the unfortunate folks who is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">sensitive to flickering lights and displays</a>, which means I can no longer use Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel phones unless those companies make some big changes.</p><p>Thankfully, OnePlus has my back and has made great strides to make a display that both looks better than the competition and still offers flicker-reduction options so I can use it!</p><p>Aside from that, the daily experience of using the OnePlus 12 has been nothing but bliss since the phone debuted earlier this year. Oxygen OS is a superb version of Android built on Android 14 which includes some of the best features I&apos;ve ever seen on a smartphone and a great UI that I enjoy using every day. It&apos;s got more options than a Pixel but isn&apos;t as convoluted as a Galaxy.</p><p>I also cannot sell the hardware short here. Not only is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inside incredibly fast but OnePlus Trinity Engine means that basically all games run at 120FPS thanks to AI-based frame interpolation. Plus, the phone keeps cool under pressure because of a great cooling design.</p><p>OnePlus charging speed is legendary in the industry, and I&apos;m always pleasantly surprised at how quickly this phone charges. Seriously, just 20 minutes usually gets me a full battery and it blows me away every time.</p><p>And while the haptics are the best in the business, I can&apos;t say the camera is the greatest one I&apos;ve ever used. It&apos;s perfectly fine, don&apos;t get me wrong, but camera snobs will probably want to stick to a Google Pixel if that&apos;s the most important thing on a phone to them. As someone who generally prioritizes a good camera, though, I haven&apos;t found many situations where it&apos;s been a massive disappointment.</p>

Case in point: you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP?th=1">save a record-breaking $150</a> by buying the affordable OnePlus 12R unlocked. You get a mid-range phone with a flagship-level Snapdragon 8Gen 2 processor, a 6.78-inch screen, 100W charging, IP65, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3.</p><p>This flagship killer, as Android Central&apos;s Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda called it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review" target="_blank">in his review</a>, doesn&apos;t have wireless charging but offers some specs you would find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>. If you don&apos;t care for those more expensive phones but still want better specs than most budget phones, the OnePlus 12R is a great option.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> comes with a 30% discount today for Prime Day, making it more accessible for all. This flagship killer features a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 50MP primary camera, Wi-Fi 7, Android 14, 5500mAh battery, and an IP67 rating.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 12R is only a notch below the flagship <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> model but it costs considerably less. You get a premium 6.7-inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (2780x1264) display with Dolby Vision and 16,00 nits. The fancy-looking phone has a great style with its round camera bump. This is the moment to get the deal to enjoy this great Android phone and all the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/prime-day-android-phone-deals-2024">Amazon Prime Day deals</a> going on right now.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ9SZ6CP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2d8e5f77-a2d9-4dda-9e93-7938244a83df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="OnePlus 12R 128GB: $499.99" data-dimension48="OnePlus 12R 128GB: $499.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a powerful processor without breaking the bank and need a phone with a fantastic 5500mAh battery. If you like the specs the OnePlus 12 has to offer, but don&apos;t really care in having a flagship phone.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> the phone you need must have a telephoto camera, needs an IP68 rating, love high-quality selfies and videos. If you also need the phone to have wireless charging. The phone also only gets three years of software updates, so if having the latest Android version is important, you might want to go for one that offer more, such as the Galaxy S24 series.</p>

Otherwise, among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/prime-day-smartwatch-deals-2024">best Prime Day smartwatch deals</a>, I&apos;ll point out a few options from Garmin&apos;s fitness rivals that you may want to consider instead!</p>

<p>I called the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a> the "best runner's watch, period" in my review in 2023, and while the Forerunner 965 supplanted it later that year, the 955 still has all of the same running metrics like real-time stamina, training load, and workout recommendations, plus excellent 15-day battery life with 42 hours of GPS. You have to accept an MIP display instead of AMOLED, but the 955 is still pixel-rich and easier to read in direct sunlight, and it's hard to turn it down when it costs <strong>$280 less</strong> than the 965 thanks to Prime Day!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner%C2%AE-Smartwatch-Triathletes-Long-Lasting/dp/B09WTTD27P" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4fe5c70f-f6b3-4655-a714-5292b5cb6f79" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Forerunner 955: $499" data-dimension48="Garmin Forerunner 955: $499">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>I found a couple of Instinct models on sale, but we love the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-crossover-review">Instinct Crossover</a> because its hybrid design adds a little style and class to its outdoorsy look. Otherwise, its bulky design makes it ready to withstand any water or shock damage, it lasts up to 70 days with solar, and it has many of my favorite Forerunner metrics like training load and readiness.

<p>This deal barely lives up to the name, but I'm trying to prioritize watches people can actually afford over epic models where you "save" hundreds but still spend more than a traditional watch. The Vivoactive 5 is a mid-tier Garmin with an AMOLED display that's for people that can't afford the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>, with some of the same sleep coaching, all-systems GNSS for more accurate tracking, and comparable 11-day battery life. I wish it had an altimeter for elevation tracking, but this is a great option in particular for frugal indoor athletes. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9a04bbea-45b6-417a-a147-0cb4cbb7a581" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Vivoactive 5: $299" data-dimension48="Garmin Vivoactive 5: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-review">Garmin Venu 2</a> is one of the first Garmin watches I tried, and it's an attractive device with an AMOLED display and 10-day battery life. It falls slightly below the Vivoactive 5 for me: you miss out on newer perks like HRV status, recovery time, sleep coaching, and all-systems GNSS, but gain an altimeter and gyroscope, double the music storage, on-screen workout animations, and a more attractive steel bezel.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Advanced-Monitoring/dp/B0911JMXVX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="51e30213-91db-4941-adb6-8ecd4ed67fbd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Venu 2S: $399" data-dimension48="Garmin Venu 2S: $399">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>This is one of those "save hundreds" deals on a watch that's too expensive for a writer to afford normally. The Epix name isn't just about its 1.3-inch AMOLED display and 16-day battery life, nor its sleek titanium casing (instead of the usual Garmin polymer); it references how Garmin throws every software, training, and mapping feature it has into the Epix line-up. This is best suited for true adventurers that need detailed maps or specialized athletes like skiers, mountain bikers, or surfers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if battery life is your #1 priority, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-EnduroTM-Ultraperformance-Long-Lasting-Preloaded/dp/B09ZZ7Y8WZ"><strong>Garmin Enduro 2 is a whopping $500 off</strong></a>, with its solar-recharging MIP display that lasts 46 days. I lean towards the Epix and its AMOLED at this price range, but the Enduro 2 has most of the same software features.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-smartwatch-wellness-touchscreen-adventure/dp/B09NMM46QD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="58c2eaa5-0859-4c27-b265-baa1ff8d2772" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Epix Gen 2: $899" data-dimension48="Garmin Epix Gen 2: $899">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/is-garmin-inreach-messenger-worth-buying">Garmin InReach Messenger</a> isn't your traditional Garmin watch; instead, it's a satellite relay popular with anyone who travels into areas without cellular signal consistently but need to stay in touch with the outside world, either for safety or connecting with loved ones. Garmin's InReach satellite service is expensive, so saving money on this will net you about half a year of extra satellite time, depending on your subscription.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Messenger-Satellite-Communicator-Messaging/dp/B0BFBZR4KW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="404bb4fd-23e0-431b-877e-0ef8102cc911" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin InReach Messenger: $299" data-dimension48="Garmin InReach Messenger: $299">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>One of our very favorite running watches, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/coros-pace-2-review">COROS PACE 2</a> weighs as light as a fitness tracker and can last an absurd 20 days per charge, or 30 hours with GPS tracking.

<p>Calling it "tailor-made for data-driven runners" in my <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-pacer-pro-review">Pacer Pro review</a>, I really enjoyed my time with this running watch thanks to its comfortably light design, easy-to-navigate interface, 35 hours of GPS, and insightful running performance test if you want more info on your VO2 Max.

<p>If you're mainly on the hunt for something cheap and reliable, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> did surprisingly well when I <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">tested it against the Forerunner 165</a> for heart rate accuracy, though it fell short for GPS and steps. This week-long tracker is more comfortable and petite than a Garmin watch and has some Google smarts and sensors that you wouldn't get with the picks above. The Fitbit Sense 2 is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Smartwatch-Graphite-Included/dp/B0B4N2T7GL"><strong>$70 off for Prime Day</strong></a> as well, if you prefer a smartwatch.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-Membership-Porcelain/dp/B0CC63GZ3R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1deb8113-d7de-4dfd-a5b7-47567267d3a0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Fitbit Charge 6: $159" data-dimension48="Fitbit Charge 6: $159">View Deal</a></p></div>
