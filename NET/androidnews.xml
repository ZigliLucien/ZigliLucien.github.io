<ul><li>Meta Quest update v66 is now in beta testing for folks enrolled in the PTC channel.</li><li>VR analyst Luna found several new features in testing including Ray-Ban Meta AI, a wrist button, a resizable virtual keyboard, groundwork for more realistic avatars, and more.</li><li>Hardware improvements include more granular brightness adjustment settings for the Quest Pro, integration of Android's Bluetooth Quick Pair feature, and new sensor privacy features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta Quest update v66 began rolling out to Public Test Channel (PTC) members last week, and VR analyst Luna took the time to tear down the new update to see everything that&apos;s new, including new features hidden within the operating system code.</p><p>Published at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-ptc-v66-datamining-insights-luna/">UploadVR</a>, Luna&apos;s data mining of Quest update v66 reveals nearly a dozen new features that haven&apos;t been fully surfaced, meaning they&apos;re coded into the operating system but don&apos;t necessarily have a button or switch to enable just yet.</p><p>The most interesting of the bunch is the inclusion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">Meta AI Assistant</a> we first saw roll out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> at the end of 2023. Since then, the assistant has gained several new features thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Meta&apos;s Llama 3</a> AI model which can run locally on-device.</p><p>That could give players significant upgrades to voice commands over the current voice assistant. Based on prior updates, this new AI assistant may be able to visually identify objects in the room or potentially automatically map the room <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-v64-room-scanning-update">even better than before</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cudaQURCKwo5DPJxkL8Zkh" name="Samsung-fast-pair-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-Fold-4.jpg" alt="Setting up a Galaxy S23 Ultra with fast pair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cudaQURCKwo5DPJxkL8Zkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hand-tracking games are set to get more accessibility features, including a new wrist-mounted home button. That means you can turn your hand over in any hand-tracking app or game and tap your wrist to go home. Currently, users need to perform a pinch gesture to pull up the home menu.</p><p>Meta is also working towards making the Meta Quest feel more like a spatial computer rather than just a mixed reality headset with upcoming features like a downloads folder, implementing Android&apos;s Quick Pair for Bluetooth, calendar sync, and custom virtual keyboard resizing and placement.</p><p>Quick Pair, in particular, will make it even easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-keyboard-and-mouse-oculus-quest-2">pair a mouse and keyboard with a Meta Quest headset</a>. Plus, it&apos;s entirely possible that we&apos;ll be able to pair a Bluetooth speaker with the headset so you can control everything from there. Additionally, the improved do-not-disturb mode looks to let users schedule DnD for maximum productivity.</p><p>That should make headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">upcoming Lenovo productivity headset</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a> make much more sense as proper laptop replacements rather than expensive toys.</p>

<p>Beyond that, a new sensor lock feature will keep cameras and microphones off whenever the headset is put to sleep. That means tracking might take an extra second or two to load up when a user puts the Quest on their head, but sometimes a little waiting is worth the extra privacy.</p><p>Lastly, Meta continues to work on its realistic avatar technology, further baking support into the Quest for calibration and testing. Meta&apos;s realistic avatars would require a smartphone to scan your face (see above video) but allow for avatars that look incredibly realistic when released.</p><p>As always, with a beta release, some of these features may make it into the final June v66 update, while others may be delayed for release in future updates. There&apos;s also no guarantee that any of these features will make it to a final software version, but most features available in a firmware beta tend to get released soon after public testing.</p>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI made waves last week when it announced GPT-4o, a multimodal AI model that may be the most advanced and futuristic one we’ve seen to date. It sounds like a human, can interact with users via vision and audio, and is knowledgeable. OpenAI ended up beating Google to the punch, and GPT-4o seems more advanced than Project Astra, which Google previewed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google I/O 2024</a>.</p><p>But one of the voices OpenAI chose for GPT-4o has been drawing attention online for all the wrong reasons. First, some users on social media pointed out they thought the voice “Sky” was overly flirty and sultry to the point it was unsettling. Then, people started noticing the similarities between the voice of Sky and that of Scarlett Johansson, the award-winning actress. Now, it appears that may have been intentional.</p><p>To be clear, OpenAI denies that the voice of Sky was based on Johansson and even released a blog post explaining how the voices were chosen. However, Johansson put out a scathing statement telling the story of how OpenAI approached her about officially voicing GPT-4o, which she declined. After facing legal pressure from Johansson’s lawyers, the company removed the Sky voice option from GPT-4o. </p><p>As distressing as this situation is, it’s almost ironic. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman told Johansson that her voice, being the official voice of ChatGPT, would be more comforting to users. And yet, by releasing a voice so similar to Johansson‘s without her permission, Altman and OpenAI ended up perfectly encapsulating everything that makes people uncomfortable about AI. </p>
<h2 id="did-openai-steal-scarlett-johansson-x2018-s-voice-2">Did OpenAI steal Scarlett Johansson‘s voice?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP" name="ChatGPT-hero.jpg" alt="ChatGPT conversation screen on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UxkEjFyJ7VMwPGcRaYjtgP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though OpenAI says that it sought out professional voice actors for GPT-4o and did not seek someone who sounded like Johansson specifically, the evidence might tell a different story. It starts in September 2023, according to Johansson, when OpenAI’s Altman reached out about hiring her as a voice actor for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-now-use-chatgpt-without-an-account">ChatGPT</a>. </p><p>“He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and Al,” she said in a statement to NPR’s Bobby Allyn. “He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.”</p><p>Johansson eventually decided not to go forward with voicing GPT-4o. However, it’s easy to hear her resemblance in the Sky voice that ended up being demoed and shipped with the AI model. To say that Johansson was displeased with the result would be an understatement. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement from Scarlett Johansson on the OpenAI situation. Wow: pic.twitter.com/8ibMeLfqP8<a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1792679435701014908">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>“We believe that AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity&apos;s distinctive voice— Sky’s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,“ OpenAI said in a blog post. </p><p>The whole reason that OpenAI wanted a voice like Johansson’s, as Altman is said to have told her, is to make AI more comforting. People may be more scared about AI than they are excited about it. Especially those in creative industries are finding that AI is being used to automate writing, visual art, music, and other mediums. This isn’t something unique to OpenAI — Apple recently came under fire and apologized for an advertisement that literally saw instruments being crushed into pieces and replaced with an iPad. </p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntjkwIXWtrc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>By using her likeness in a GPT-4o voice without her permission — whether intentionally or unintentionally — OpenAI ended up validating the discomfort associated with AI that it was desperately trying to address. Creatives, from actors and actresses to writers and photographers, are worried about being replaced by AI. The idea that OpenAI could have mimicked Johansson‘s voice for GPT-4o is exactly the kind of thing that worries and alarms people in creative industries. </p><p>“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,” Johansson wrote, explaining that she asked OpenAI to show how it developed the Sky voice. “In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity.”</p>
<h2 id="we-shouldn-x2019-t-want-ai-to-sound-this-human-2">We shouldn’t want AI to sound this human</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3635px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B" name="How to use Google Gemini on Android.jpg" alt="Using Google Gemini on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3635" height="2045" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the unsettling idea that a company could rip off an actress‘ voice after disagreeing with a deal, there are other reasons why we don’t want AI voices to sound like Sky. All of OpenAI’s GPT-4o voices, and especially Sky, sound very human-like. This is a problem, because there is a high level of trust and familiarity people have with human voices. When you talk to a voice assistant like Siri or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Alexa</a>, it’s clear that you’re talking to — for lack of a better word — a robot. After having a conversation with GPT-4o, that level of clarity won’t always be in the back of your mind. </p><p>Right now, AI models have a problem, and it’s that they confidently state their answers as fact even when they are blatantly wrong. People still end up believing AI responses as true despite the array of warnings that come along with them. As voices for AI models become more human-sounding, this problem will only get worse. It’ll be easy for the average user of an AI tool to believe what is being said thanks to the welcoming human voice it uses. </p><p>In trying to make people more comfortable with the future of AI, OpenAI ended up making it feel <em>more</em> dystopian. We shouldn’t want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">AI to sound as human as GPT-4o</a>, and there are plenty of reasons why. It could foster an unwarranted level of trust between users and AI models, as well as put creatives like Johansson In a precarious position.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/swappable-popsockets-review">PopSockets</a> are some of the most popular and widely-used phone grips on the market for a reason: they last a long time, really help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/popsockets-and-phone-grips-why-they-matter-and-why-you-should-use-one" data-original-url="https://www.androidcentral.com/popsockets-and-phone-grips-why-they-matter-and-why-you-should-use-one">reduce the stress</a> on your hands, and come in more styles than you can possibly imagine. PopSockets are also impressively affordable, but PopGrips with premium materials and franchised designs can get a little pricey for such a small plastic accessory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Once you pop a PopTop, you'll find it hard to stop.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One of the more addictive aspects of PopSockets is its trademarked accordion design, which pops in and out in a satisfying fashion. The biggest issue with the older PopSocket design was the thickness that interfered with wireless charging. You also had to either pry the whole darn thing off your phone or disassemble the tops in order to swap them. PopSockets decided to fix both of these issues with the Swappable PopGrips and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/get-a-magsafe-popsocket-this-black-friday-i-put-one-on-my-pixel-and-it-was-a-game-changer">PopSockets for MagSafe</a>.</p><p>By allowing you to twist off PopTops from the PopGrip base, you can remove the bulk while using wireless charging, great news as wireless charging expands to more and more phones. You can also swap PopGrip designs to match your outfit, mood, or even Poptivism PopGrips that support a wide variety of charities like The Trevor Project, March for Our Lives, and Charity: Water. Just be mindful that once you start a PopGrip collection, they can get slightly addictive.</p>

<p>While PopSockets are more prevalent, popular, and diversely designed, some folks simply prefer the traditional ring-style design. The Spigen Style Ring 360 is more functional than PopSockets, which makes it a better grip for a lot of users that can see beyond PopSockets&apos; cutesy designs.</p><p>Ring grips are awesome because you only need one finger to use them, as opposed to at least two with the PopSockets. The Style Ring 360 also allows you to flip it over and hang your phone off the back of your hand when you need both hands to carry something like a food tray or grocery bags.</p><p>The Style Ring 360 can allow your phone to sit flat on a tabletop, and a magnetic plate is hidden in that flat back so that you can use it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-magnetic-car-mounts">magnetic car mounts</a>, too. Of course, that plate inhibits wireless charging, but metal grips almost always interfere with that anyway. Thanks to the 360-degree rotation of the base and the 180-degree hinge on the ring itself, you can use it as a kickstand in landscape or portrait mode on most phones so long as you don&apos;t stick it to your case too close to the bottom.</p><p>Plastic grips like PopSockets can potentially last a lot longer than metal grips like the Style Ring 360, whose bearings and hinge will inevitably wear out over the course of several months. It depends on how heavily you use it and how heavy your phone is.</p>

<p>As noted, I have been using HANDL New York&apos;s flexible brace for many years and it has become one of my favorite phone accessories. The flexible brace, designed by a painter who got his inspiration from how he held his palette in his hand, the grip stretches out to wrap around your fingers. Hold it like that while taking a selfie or recording video, even twisting the phone whichever way you need (great for lefties like me!)</p><p>When you&apos;re down, let go and it falls right back into place. Stretch to click the top into the bottom and voila! You have a handy kickstand as well. You get so used to clicking, flexing, and holding that it becomes second nature. I even find it useful to simply hold your phone at your side while you walk using the brace: it won&apos;t fall out!</p><p>With tons of colors and designs from which to choose, keep in mind that it does protrude slightly from the back of the phone which means it won&apos;t sit flat on a table or other surface. Depending on how much you use it, the brace will also wear over time, though it took several years for this to happen to mine.</p>

<p>This snappy silver/black grip can serve as a kickstand, a phone grip, and either a standalone car mount or a mounting plate for a magnetic mount thanks to the bi-stable metal spring inside. That spring is insanely durable, which means that unlike a Spigen Style Ring 360 or Speck GrabTab, the Scooch Wingback Universal will definitely last you years and years.</p><p>While the actual in-hand grip with the Scooch isn&apos;t quite as natural for smaller fingers, it&apos;s easy to get the hang of and its kickstand is far superior thanks to that springy metal back. It may wobble in portrait mode from time to time, but it won&apos;t slowly sink and flatten the way portrait kickstands on most phone grips will.</p><p>The Scooch Wingback Universal produces an angle that&apos;s high enough to easily reference notes on your phone while typing on your computer. You can easily snap this grip flat or push it out with one hand. It may not be the cheapest grip on this list, but it&apos;s certainly the most well-made one.</p>

<p>Popsockets makes a second entry on this list for its phone grip that&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">compatible with MagSafe</a>, allowing you to use it with virtually any case, turning it into a wireless charging compatible one. Available in a range of colors, it magnetically attaches to a case using the included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/consider-adding-magsafe-adapter-for-android">magnetic adapter ring</a>, and then can be used like any other Popsocket.</p><p>The advantage here is that it&apos;s simple to remove as well as put on without the need for adhesives. Just keep in mind that while it works with most cell phone cases, this grip is best on cases that aren&apos;t made of silicone, that aren&apos;t textured, and that don&apos;t have an anti-fingerprint coating.</p><p>Once you want to recharge your phone, slide the grip off, charge, and then pop it back on like magic. While this one is slightly more expensive than others, the ability to transform a cheap old case into a high-tech one, and wirelessly charge your phone is worth it.</p>

<p>While in-hand use is the most important part of phone grip usage, the CLCKR Phone Grip and Expanding Stand can do so much more than that. It doubles as a sturdy portrait and landscape kickstand, giving you two phone accessories in one compact package. While most phone grips can be landscape kickstands in a pinch, they can&apos;t hack it vertically, but CLCKR is one of the few that actually makes for a darn good vertical kickstand.</p><p>You can snap the CLCKR&apos;s strap between flat and a kickstand, and you can leave it loose as a hand strap when holding the phone as you walk around. Unlike the Speck GrabTab, the strap doesn&apos;t bow up or flop around when not in use; it snaps back into place to stay flat and out of the way. Unlike the Scooch, the kickstand won&apos;t bounce around since it locks into place properly. It also comes in a half-dozen materials and finishes and several colors of each.</p><p>The only real problem with the CLCKR is that you can&apos;t use it on smaller phones or phones with a rear fingerprint sensor. You might find it dominating the rear of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">petite Android phone</a> like the Galaxy S24 or Pixel 8. Also, while 4.2mm isn&apos;t very thick for a phone grip, it&apos;s still too thick to allow for wireless charging.</p>

<p>Plastic and metal grips can last a long time, but they can also be hard to grip for hours and hours on end if you&apos;re a power user. That&apos;s where fabric grips like the LoveHandle come in. This adorable little bow can help you avoid wearing out your fingers pinching a PopSocket or slinging a Style Ring 360, and since it&apos;s an elastic fabric strap, it&apos;s available in so many cute and adorable styles.</p><p>Of course, fabric can have its own pitfalls: elastic wears out over time, especially if you have a habit of yo-yo-ing your phone on your finger when you&apos;re bored. Fabric can also pick up stains and smells from spilled coffee and greasy, sweaty fingers, so you&apos;ll want to take care to keep your hands and your LoveHandle clean.</p><p>The LoveHandle Universal Grip is also one of the few phone grips on the market to not have any kickstand ability at all. However, that just means it&apos;s doing one thing well instead of trying to do two things poorly like many phone grips. You won&apos;t find any comfort or wireless charging incompatibility issues here.</p>

<p>Phone grips tend to monopolize the back of your phone, and if you&apos;re used to keeping a stick-on card slot back there for your work ID or credit card, good news! You can get stick-on wallets with phone grips attached. Sinjimoru makes a wide array of these card pouches, including a couple of models with elastic phone grips on the back, but the Sinji Pouch B-Flap is the best of the bunch.</p><p>Despite the rather bland name, this grip comes in one of five warm colors including ruby red and autumn gold. The Sinjimoru Sinji Pouch B-Flap has room for up to five cards or cash, and the elastic strap can be used with one to four fingers slipped through it, whatever is the most comfortable for you.</p><p>Like the LoveHandle, the elastic here can wear out over time, but some users have also reported seams busting after a few months as well. If you tend to be hard on your tech, you might want to opt for a metal or plastic grip instead.</p>

<h2 id="why-popsockets-are-the-best-phone-grips-2">Why PopSockets are the best phone grips</h2>
<p>While there are about as many phone grip styles as there are case styles out there, PopSockets remain the most popular because they work well, last a long time, and with the newer Swappable PopGrips style, they&apos;re both easier to upgrade to a new style and use with Qi wireless charging.</p><p>PopSockets come in hundreds upon hundreds of styles, including Poptivism styles that benefit specific charities of just about every type you could imagine. Whether you want to swap out for PopTops that highlight your Disney fangirling or support your team on game day, there&apos;s probably a PopSocket for that. Another useful quirk of PopSockets is that they can double as fidget toys to help keep me from spacing out during staff meetings. These all help PopSockets be part toy, part tool, making them <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-grips-students">perfect for kids, too</a>.</p><p>If you prefer a phone grip you can hook a finger through rather than having to pinch the PopSockets&apos; plastic accordion, the Spigen Style Ring 360 is a great ring grip that works well as a kickstand, too. And if you want more flexibility (literally), I urge you to consider the HANDLstick as well.</p><p>Without a PopSocket or another grip, holding a large phone isn&apos;t just inconvenient; it can actually develop into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-i-use-phone-grip">repetitive stress injury</a>, especially if you spend a lot of time on a keyboard. That&apos;s why you should invest in one of these picks and give your hands and wrists a break.</p>

In a nutshell, that means there are a <em>ton</em> of amazing features that you&apos;ve got to check out.</p><p>But which ones should you try first? We&apos;ve got a list of all the first things you need to do with your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> to get the best experience. From Audio Magic Eraser to VPN, Google&apos;s AI-based call screening, or even car crash detection, Pixels do so much more than you probably realized. There&apos;s a reason the Pixel A-series sits atop our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-call-screening"><span>Call screening</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Dxgzw4LCjFr9dd7fUhgD4h" name="google-pixel-8a-caller-id-spam.jpg" alt="Spam caller detection settings on a Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dxgzw4LCjFr9dd7fUhgD4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone hates spam calls and robo calls, two things that seem to only get worse, not better. Thankfully, your Pixel has a built-in AI-driven feature that can identify spam calls and automatically filter them. That means Google Assistant can actually be your <em>personal</em> assistant, including asking callers why they&apos;ve called and helping them leave a message if it is actually important.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to enable that.</p>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Phone app</strong>.</li><li>Tap the <strong>three dots</strong> on the top right and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Caller ID & spam</strong> from the list.</li><li><strong>Click the toggle</strong> next to caller and spam ID to enable the feature.</li></ol>
<p>While Google Assistant will automatically filter calls that have been deemed spam, there are times when you might want to manually filter them yourself even if it&apos;s not a spam call.</p><p>When a call comes in, you can tap the <strong>Screen call</strong> button between the "answer" and "decline" buttons. That&apos;ll have Google Assistant pick up for you and walk the caller through leaving a message. That&apos;s particularly good for when you&apos;re busy but don&apos;t want to miss a call from a friend, family member, or colleague.</p>

<p>Mager Eraser does exactly what it says on the tin. The tool lets you "magically erase" anything you want in an image with just a tap or by circling it. Using the tool is easy, and it&apos;s free to use for all Pixel phone owners. Everyone else will need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription</a> to use it.</p><p>Our guide for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">how to use Magic Eraser</a> gives you all the details, but here&apos;s a quick overview:</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> launched with the Pixel 8 series in October 2023 and brought AI photo editing to the small screen. With Magic Editor, you can move and resize objects in a photo, fill in missing details, and even change how the sky looks to enhance any image.</p><p>The tool has seemingly unlimited potential that&apos;s mostly constrained to your imagination, although it&apos;s not expressly designed to be an AI image generation tool. Rather, it&apos;s designed to fix up photos and make them look the way you <em>originally</em> envisioned them.</p>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Photos app</strong> and find a photo you want to edit.</li><li>Tap the <strong>Edit button</strong> on the bottom row of icons.</li><li>Tap the <strong>multicolored icon</strong> on the bottom left to launch Magic Editor.</li><li><strong>Tap or circle</strong> any object you want to chose, then long-press and slide to move it, or pinch to enlarge or shrink it.</li><li>To change the look of the sky, tap the <strong>magic wand</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen and choose your preferred look from the list.</li><li>When you're done, tap <strong>Done</strong>, then <strong>Save a copy.</strong></li></ol>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> is Google&apos;s first "magic" feature for videos, and it works by analyzing the sounds in a video and using AI to split them into channels. From here, you can adjust the volume of each channel in a way that truly feels magical, helping remove unwanted background noise or other distractions.</p><p>Better yet, you can use the feature on <strong>any</strong> video, not just ones you&apos;ve recorded with your Pixel 8a. That means you can go back through all your old footage of your kids or family and take out traffic noises in family vacation videos, increase the volume of your kids voices to make them clearer, or even take out that distracting music playing in the background.</p><p>Here&apos;s an idea of what it can do and how to do it yourself:</p>

<p>Like other Pixel phones before it, the Pixel 8a supports a number of gestures that can make common actions as simple as turning your phone over or double-tapping the back instead of searching through menus or opening apps.</p><p>I love the <strong>Tap to check phone</strong> gesture, which makes it easy to check your lockscreen notifications by just double-tapping the display. That&apos;s super handy for when the phone is on a table and you just want a quick glance.</p><p>I also love the <strong>Quick tap to start actions</strong> gesture, which lets you double-tap on the back of the phone to launch any app, or choose from a number of actions to launch instead.</p><p>To find these and all the gestures on the phone, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app or just swipe down twice on the phone's status bar, then click the settings icon.</li><li>Scroll down to and tap <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Gestures</strong> from the list.</li></ol>

<p>Have you ever heard a song playing in a public place and wondered what it was? You can always open Google Assistant and have it identify a song, but I&apos;ve had plenty of times where I wasn&apos;t fast enough and missed my opportunity. That&apos;s what makes Pixel&apos;s Now Playing feature so great!</p><p>Now Playing automatically identifies any music it hears <em>all the time</em> and will give you a quick way to find that song without needing to open an app and wait for it to listen. Plus, Now Playing has a song history list that makes it easy to scroll back and listen through any songs that might have been playing around you recently, making it super easy to identify what you&apos;ve heard throughout the day.</p><p>Here&apos;s how to enable Now Playing:</p>
<ol><li>Open your <strong>Settings app</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sound & Vibration</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Now Playing</strong>.</li><li>Toggle <strong>Identify songs playing nearby</strong> on.</li></ol>
<p>Now, when you hear a song playing and you want to identify it, all you need to do is look at your lockscreen. The song playing will appear at the bottom of the screen below the fingerprint sensor icon. If you want to find that song on your favorite music service, just tap the song name, unlock your phone, and Now Playing will give you several options for listening.</p><p>If you want to check on your Now Playing history, here&apos;s how to find all the songs your phone has recently heard:</p>
<ol><li>Open your <strong>Settings app</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sound & Vibration</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Now Playing</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Now Playing history</strong>.</li><li>Find your song in the list.</li></ol>

<p>Google Pixel phones were the first phones to be able to detect car crashes and have been offering the option since 2019. This is a no-cost service that uses your phone&apos;s sensors to detect a potential car crash, then can automatically call emergency services if the need arises.</p><p>You&apos;ll need to accept a number of permissions in order to use the feature, however, so just be aware that the list of required permissions is quite lengthy. Here&apos;s how to enable car crash detection:</p>
<ol><li>Open your <strong>Settings app</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Car crash detection</strong>.</li><li>Sign in to Google Personal Safety with your <strong>Google account</strong>.</li><li><strong>Accept any permissions </strong>required to use the Personal Safety app.</li><li>Click the <strong>banner up top </strong>for location permission, then select <strong>Allow all the time</strong> for location access.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Actions if you need help after a crash</strong> section and enable any actions you want your phone to perform in the event of detecting a car crash.</li></ol>

<p>From here, you can change the font, color, size, and style of the clock, select a different wallpaper for your home and lock screen, and modify the two shortcuts in the bottom corners.</p><p>A word of note: some lock screen customizations are only visible when you have no notifications, so you may want to disable lock screen notifications if this bothers you. That can be done in the lock screen customization options.</p>

<p>Every Pixel ships with a free VPN service by Google. While it used to be available to all Google One subscribers, the company has since rescinded the offer, making it a totally Pixel-exclusive feature. That means your Pixel&apos;s internet traffic can be secure no matter if you&apos;re using sketchy Wi-Fi at a cafe or even the spotty Wi-Fi on an airplane.</p><p>Google&apos;s VPN service isn&apos;t as full-featured as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPNs</a>, so there&apos;s no way to change your location or customize other features, but it still keeps your internet traffic encrypted and secure. Plus, you can&apos;t beat free! Here&apos;s how to enable Pixel VPN:</p>
<ol><li>Open your <strong>Settings app</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Network & internet</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>VPN</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>VPN by Google One</strong> from the list.</li><li><strong>Click the toggle</strong> next to <strong>Use VPN</strong> to enable the feature.</li><li>You can also toggle VPN by Google One in the <strong>quick toggles </strong>area of your notification shade. Just pull down twice on the status bar at the top of the display.</li></ol>

<p>Google Play Points, which launched in 2019 as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-redeem-google-play-points-movies-shows-and-apps-google-tv">marketplace&apos;s own rewards program</a>, is back with a new set of perks and rewards to spice up your experience.</p><p>Of particular interest is Diamond Valley, a treasure hunt mini-game that&apos;s making its way to the U.S. on June 17, according to a post on Google&apos;s blog site. If you&apos;re curious, it&apos;s already up and running in Korea and Japan.</p><p>Google Play Points is a rewards program for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play</a> users. The tech giant reveals that it&apos;s a hit with over 220 million members who use it to rack up points and score rewards.</p><p>In this mini-game, you get to hunt for diamonds and trade them in for a shot at awesome prizes like Pixel devices, exclusive game merchandise, bonus points, and more.</p><p>You can pre-register for Diamond Valley to grab some extra diamonds.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Honor is stepping up its game by diving into generative AI technology with a unique on-device AI approach.</li><li>At the VivaTech event, Honor shared its plans to power future devices with AI from Google Cloud.</li><li>The Honor 200 series is also set to go global on June 12, after a debut in China on May 27.</li><li>Moreover, the MagicOS 8.0 update, which is all about AI, is coming soon to the foldable Magic V2 and the Honor 90.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over the past year, Honor has emerged as a key player in the smartphone market by focusing on innovative hardware and is now stepping into generative AI technology. The company today introduced its unique on-device AI approach.</p><p>At VivaTech, a European technology showcase, Honor revealed plans to equip its future devices with generative AI powered by Google Cloud. The company is keen on harnessing AI to boost user privacy and personalize experiences. As part of this effort, Honor unveiled its new "4-Layer AI Architecture" to incorporate AI thoroughly across all user interactions.</p><p>Honor also revealed that the Honor 200 series will make its global debut on June 12. Initially previewed in China earlier this month, the series will be fully introduced there on May 27.</p><p>Additionally, the company announced that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-magicos-80-with-android-14-and-a-generous-serving-of-ai">MagicOS 8.0</a> update, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and packed with AI features, will soon be rolling out to the foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-90-and-90-pro-china-launch">Honor 90</a>.</p><p>Honor emphasized that Magic OS 8.0 is the industry&apos;s first intent-based UI, designed to predict what users might need next and make things smoother. A cool example of this is the Magic Portal feature, which turns complicated tasks into easy, one-step actions and adjusts to how individual users like to do things.</p><p>Smartphone companies are packing AI features into their new models, hoping to convince consumers to switch to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest and greatest phones</a>.</p><p>Honor&apos;s use of Google&apos;s AI features is a natural step since its smartphones already run on Google&apos;s Android operating system. Developing complex AI features can be a big challenge for phone companies on their own, so working with Google is like a fast track to getting the latest AI apps and tools on their devices.</p><p>Honor is one of the few brands to embrace Google&apos;s AI tools. Earlier this year, Samsung got into the mix too, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-features-galaxy-s24-series-detailed">announcing a deal with Google to add Gemini Pro and Imagen 2 to its lineup</a>.</p>

While phone designs and hardware haven&apos;t changed too much, the one area that is seeing continual improvement is mobile imaging, with Chinese brands in particular pushing the boundaries of camera tech.</p>

<p>Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">OPPO Find X7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a> all have outstanding cameras, and while there are differences between each device, you&apos;re guaranteed to get great shots regardless of whichever phone you choose. And while Chinese brands are doing a decent job with software, there&apos;s still some way to go in this area.</p><p>I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Porsche Design Magic 6 RSR</a> extensively in recent weeks, and the device has a lot to offer; it combines distinctive styling with terrific cameras, but Honor&apos;s MagicOS is irksome to use at times, and it misses out on a few basics. That&apos;s why I decided to switch back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> once I was done with the current review cycle.</p><p>I&apos;ve always gravitated to Pixels; in previous years, Pixel devices got the most amount of usage out of all other phones. The reasoning is simple: I like Google&apos;s vision of Android, and the Pixel&apos;s clean interface coupled with unique software extras makes it the ideal choice for my own use case.</p><p>I&apos;ll freely admit that the Pixel 8 Pro doesn&apos;t have the best feature-set: the OLED panel doesn&apos;t get as bright as 2024 phones, the hardware is hilariously unsuited for gaming, the battery doesn&apos;t last as long, and 30W charging is pitifully slow. From just a hardware point of view, it is objectively worse.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TmopkaobwSLhDg7jgXCAAc" name="google-pixel-8-pro-phone-pile-6.jpg" alt="Pixel 8 Pro next to 2024 phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TmopkaobwSLhDg7jgXCAAc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google doesn&apos;t even have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best cameras</a> in the industry. Chinese brands have made greater strides in this regard over the last 15 months, and the switch to massive 1-inch sensors combined with overhauled camera tuning means the likes of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Find X7 Ultra, and Magic 6 Pro take much better photos than the Pixel 8 Pro in any given scenario.</p><p>The Xiaomi 14 Ultra in particular is terrific, and the Magic 6 Pro somehow manages to take outstanding photos of fast-moving objects. Out of all the phones I used this year, I liked the cameras on the Find X7 Ultra the best — I prefer its color vibrancy to that of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and the phone does a better job with portrait shots in challenging scenarios.</p><p>But I don&apos;t care about any of that. What the Pixel 8 Pro lacks in hardware prowess it more than makes up for in the software, and that ultimately is the differentiator. The Find X7 Ultra&apos;s interface is fluid like no other phone around, but trying to wrestle the Chinese ColorOS build to do what I wanted became a constant source of frustration. Same with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra — Xiaomi&apos;s long-awaited software overhaul isn&apos;t meaningfully different, and if anything, it is more annoying to use.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 Pro, meanwhile, manages to deliver an overall experience that&apos;s just better than other devices. The software doesn&apos;t have as many features as its rivals, but the ones Google included inevitably get a lot of use; I like At A Glance and Now Playing and constantly utilize both features, Recorder is my go-to choice to record and transcribe interviews, and all the AI-infused camera features that debuted in the Pixel 8 Pro are fantastic to use.</p><p>While a lot of brands are bundling AI into just about every product they can imagine, I like what Google did in this area. Best Shot, Audio Magic Eraser, and Magic Editor are all useful features that make a difference in how I take and edit photos and videos, and I even get a lot of utility out of Video Boost.</p><p>There&apos;s also the fact that I like the Material You interface; it is quirky and playful, and it does a great job with the basics: notification management, UI navigation, and security. </p><p>I know it isn&apos;t for everyone, but for what I need from a phone, the Pixel 8 Pro continues to be the perfect choice.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm is allegedly sending new XR2 and XR2+ Gen 3 chips out to VR HMDs.</li><li>These "Project Matrix" chips supposedly support 16GB of RAM, UFS 4.0 storage, and 4K screens and may use Oryon CPUs.</li><li>The Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 was announced in early January and has yet to be featured in consumer products.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm reportedly has begun testing and lending out its Snapdragon XR2 Gen 3 and XR2+ Gen 3 chips, designed for the next generation of VR headsets. This leaked news surprised us, given that one Gen 2 chip hasn&apos;t entered consumers&apos; hands yet.</p><p>WinFuture&apos;s Roland Quandt first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/rquandt/status/1791626922645954608">posted</a> on X about "Project Matrix," the company&apos;s "next-gen AR/VR chips," on May 17. Specifically, he explained how the higher-end SXR2350 will support 16GB of RAM, UFS 4.0 storage, and 4K screens. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'Project Matrix' https://t.co/wO4jAXnyZ0<a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1791626922645954608">May 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>More recently, VR analyst Brad Lynch shared a leaked cargo manifest showing that Qualcomm is shipping out the SXR2350 chip — likely called the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 — for "testing and integration in future HMDs."</p><p>Lynch speculates that it&apos;ll be "nearly identical" to the XR2+ Gen 2 in features and bandwidth, but use the Oryon CPU found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> instead of Arm Cortex cores, plus a more energy-efficient GPU. </p><p>Qualcomm is "shipping these much faster than the gap between Gen 1 and Gen 2," Lynch points out in the same thread, arguing that "there must be (a) huge demand for something better" than the XR2+ Gen 2. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My personal speculation* on what changes we will see in this chip (probably next year):- Orion CPU cores (the biggest change)- More power efficient GPU at similar graphic performance as XR2 Gen 2- nearly identical XR features/bandwidths as XR2 Gen 2<a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1792814078089691289">May 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> used the XR2+ Gen 1, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> uses the XR2 Gen 2, which gives it strong gaming performance. The XR2 Gen 3 (no "+") would theoretically target the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a>, but that&apos;s not expected to arrive for years.</p><p>Qualcomm only announced the upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</a> in January 2024, with Samsung, Sony, and HTC Vive committing to use this chip in future productivity headsets that require more power. As of yet, none of them have shipped. </p><p>Qualcomm says the XR2+ Gen 2 can support 4.3K per eye resolution, 12 concurrent cameras, and 15% & 20% boosts to GPU and CPU frequency, respectively, over the XR2 Gen 2. It&apos;s certainly an upgrade, but not a drastic shift in power. The leaked XR2+ Gen <strong>3</strong> could change that. </p>
<h2 id="early-testing-or-a-rapid-fire-shift-2">Early testing or a rapid-fire shift?</h2>
<p>Multiple leakers agree that the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 is coming. The question is, why so soon after the XR2+ Gen 2 announcement?</p><p>This new chip&apos;s power makes it well-suited for productivity headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2">Meta Quest Pro 2</a>, with its rumored 3,840 x 3,840 resolution — but LG has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-2-new-display-delay">delayed it until 2027, reportedly</a>. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Meta Horizon OS</a> headsets could use it, like Lenovo&apos;s XR productivity headset. But that might not arrive for some time, either. </p><p>At present, devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung&apos;s 2024 XR headset</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-announces-high-end-xr-headset-to-compete-with-apple-vision-pro">Sony&apos;s spatial XR headset</a> are slated to use the XR2+ Gen 2. So why send the XR2+ Gen 3 out to HMDs if they&apos;re still finalizing their Gen 2 headsets? </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oJ9WqVcT37QWSqBfkPHwDb" name="Sony-XR-headset-display-flipped-down.jpg" alt="A man wears the unnamed Sony XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJ9WqVcT37QWSqBfkPHwDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Sony XR headset that reportedly uses the XR2+ Gen 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can only think of two possibilities: (A) Samsung and Co. asked for a chip with more power and will skip the Gen 2 after all, or (B) Qualcomm itself wants to persuade these brands to try its newer, better tech, now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-launch-details">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will use Oryon</a> later this year.</p><p>The Apple Vision Pro used an M2 chip found in MacBooks, making it difficult for other productivity headsets to compete. Charging a laptop-level price for productivity headsets with Snapdragon XR2 chips — essentially redesigned versions of mobile chips found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> — is a tall ask for consumers.</p><p>If the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 3 has Snapdragon X Elite-quality performance with better RAM, then maybe Samsung would delay its headset into 2025 to see a greater chance of success. We&apos;ll have to wait and see whether the XR2+ Gen 2 actually sees the light of day or not, if the Gen 3 has supplanted it. </p>

<ul><li>Google stated that it would bring ads to its AI Overviews in Search for U.S. users.</li><li>The company said that ads will only appear if they are relevant to the query and the information discovered by the AI.</li><li>According to its data, Google states that users in previous tests have found ads in its overviews to be helpful.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is preparing to create more "opportunities" for consumers seeking information through Search with ads.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ai-creativity-google-marketing-live/">Keyword</a> blog post, Google advised users that it will soon begin testing "Search and Shopping" ads in its AI Overviews. The company explained that ads will surface in these overviews via their own sub-section labeled "Sponsored." Ads will only appear if they are relevant to what the user is looking for and the information that artificial intelligence managed to gather.</p><p>For example, Google searched for ways to get wrinkles out of clothes. While the AI-backed overview delivered a few quick solutions and websites to help, the ads were listed at the very bottom. The section was described as "products to unwrinkle your clothes," followed by a horizontally scrolling carousel of "relevant" products.</p><p>Google states that advertisers don&apos;t need to do anything to get these ads to function properly.</p><p>Moreover, the company cites prior testing and feedback from SGE users as part of its decision to implement ads. Google said, "we’ve heard that people find the ads appearing above and below the AI-generated overview helpful."</p><p>Ads in AI Overviews are slated to begin with U.S. users before arriving elsewhere. However, the company did not state when this is set to begin.</p>

This was done on the back of its acquisition of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-liz-reid-appointed-head-of-search">new Head of Search</a>, Liz Reid. The company hoped that the many questions users have will push its AI to scour multiple sources across the web to deliver appropriate answers.</p><p>More recently, during I/O 2024, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">highlighted several</a> big generative AI features en route to Search — and AI Overviews. Understanding complex questions is expected to gain a boost as users will no longer need to break up their queries. Users will also gain the ability to "adjust" their AI Overview.</p><p>The company explained that users could ask the AI to simplify its language or to break its results down more for better understanding. Both the adjustment function and complex query understanding are on deck for Search Labs testers in English (U.S.) "soon."</p>
