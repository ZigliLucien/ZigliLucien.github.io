<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>WhatsApp is introducing a feature to set HD as the default upload quality for photos and videos.</li><li>Users no longer need to attach media as documents to avoid compression.</li><li>The feature is spotted in beta version 2.24.13.10 and expected to roll out globally soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is upping its game with a new default setting for sending high-quality photos and videos.</p><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-hd-media-sharing-default-almost-ready/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">popular messaging app</a> is rolling out a new feature that lets you set "HD" as the default upload quality for photos and videos. This means you won&apos;t have to manually choose HD every time you share media, making high-quality sharing less of a hassle.</p><p>Previously, as an alternative, some users had to attach media as documents to avoid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>&apos;s compression. This clunky workaround added extra steps to what should have been a simple process.</p><p>The latest update eliminates the need for those workarounds, ensuring your precious moments are preserved in high quality. The company has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/hd-images-in-whatsapp">working on this capability for some time</a>, with Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-hd-photos">launching HD photo sharing last August</a>. Media files sent in this manner are marked by the HD label in the bottom left corner. Later, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-send-high-quality-videos">expanded the feature to include HD video sharing</a> as well.</p><p>Although HD isn&apos;t completely lossless, it&apos;s a big step up from WhatsApp&apos;s usual compression. That infamous compression often ruined image and video quality, turning memories into pixelated disasters. This update ensures your precious moments are shared with much better clarity.</p><p>Android Police noticed the new default setting in beta version 2.24.13.10 of WhatsApp. This suggests the feature will soon be available worldwide, moving beyond the testing phase.</p>

<p>To check if you already have access to it, go to the app&apos;s settings and then open <strong>Storage and data</strong> > <strong>Media upload quality</strong>.</p><p>This update is a mixed bag for WhatsApp users. While many will celebrate the crystal-clear quality of HD uploads, WhatsApp warns that these files use more bandwidth and storage space compared to standard options. However, for those who prioritize pristine photos and videos over saving data, the extra data use is a small price to pay.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I&apos;ve been using the Motorola Razr Plus as my daily driver for about a year now, pretty much since the device launched in June 2023. To say that this has been my favorite phone to use is quite an understatement. This phone was my first foray into foldables and made me fall in love with flip phones. I&apos;ve since reviewed plenty of other clamshells over the past year, but I always go back to the Motorola Razr Plus.</p><p>It&apos;s not Motorola&apos;s first foldable Razr since the moniker was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-razr-review">revitalized back in 2019</a>, but this was a huge leap forward for the company, essentially solidifying it in the foldable market with an impressive and well-designed phone. Its biggest selling point has been the massive cover screen, which is also the biggest reason why I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-plus">chose the Razr Plus over the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Now, more competitors are coming with larger cover screens, great cameras, and other compelling specs that could give the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> a run for its money. And with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-foldables-june-launch-confirmed">the next Razr on its way</a> very soon, I want to look at how the current model has fared over the past year compared to when I first reviewed the phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-3.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3S8QFTpRzPa8aQLkLC4FqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"However, unlike its biggest competitor...the Razr Plus embraces curves, with the rear panel seamlessly flowing into the frame, which is also rounded. The result is a phone that&apos;s quite comfortable to hold, devoid of any sharp edges digging into my fingers."</strong></em></p>
<p>The phone&apos;s curvy design was one of my favorite things about it, and that remains true to this day. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">reviewing the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, returning to the Razr Plus felt like a sweet relief to my hand, especially my poor pinky finger.</p><p>Overall, the phone is actually quite sturdy and has held up relatively well in the year I&apos;ve had it. Yeah, there are a few nicks here and there on the aluminum frame, and the power button/fingerprint sensor is starting to show its age, but everything still works as it should.</p><p>The hinge has also held up, but not as well as I would hope. Yes, the phone still opens and closes just like it should, and it even retains the very soft and satisfying sound when you shut it. However, open the display at just about any angle, and I notice it doesn&apos;t feel quite as sturdy as I remember. It even wobbles quite a bit, especially when I put my finger on it, and the effect is far more dramatic than what I&apos;ve seen on other flip phones like the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Motorola Razr 2023</a>.</p><p>I can&apos;t say whether or not this is just a quirk with my particular unit, but I also sometimes hear a creaking sound when opening the phone. Not all the time, but when it does occur, I get a little concerned that the hinge is beginning to falter. It <em>should </em>be able to withstand up to 400,000 folds, although we&apos;ve seen one (rather extreme) case where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-5-vs-motorola-razr-folding-test">didn&apos;t quite reach that number</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Of the three color options, it&apos;s the only one with a faux leather back, adding a nice soft texture to the phone. I wouldn&apos;t say it feels premium, but it&apos;s definitely different from the all-glass or plain plastic phones I&apos;m used to."</strong></em></p><p>Motorola has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">leaning heavily on vegan leather</a> with its 2024 lineup, which is very nice to see on cheaper phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>. I will say that since reviewing the cheaper Razr, I find the finish on that phone feels a lot better, and I&apos;m curious to see how the next Razr will follow up. Still, the vegan leather finish is quite a nice touch on the Razr Plus and has probably saved me a few times after dropping the phone, although I&apos;d still recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-and-razr-cases">Razr Plus 2023 case</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-plus-and-razr-screen-protectors">screen protector</a> for the cover screen while you&apos;re at it.</p><p>Not all screen protectors and case combinations will work. I like the first-party Motorola cases, but the screen protector I was using would extend beyond the cover screen and onto the bezel above. Needless to say, this is a section already covered by the case, and using both at the same time just didn&apos;t work, so I had to choose which I would keep.</p>

<p><em><strong>"Aside from the faux leather back, the phone is quite glossy, which makes it look more crimson than magenta and reminds me of the red </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-g8-review"><em><strong>LG G8</strong></em></a><em><strong>. It&apos;s a beautiful phone that will surely stand out, especially if you can snag this colorway."</strong></em></p><p>The phone is still a head-turner and always gets looks whenever I use it in public. Plenty of strangers comment on it, saying how cool it looks and that it resembles a Game Boy Advance SP. I find that the people who are most in awe when they see the Razr Plus are iPhone users. Given the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in the iPhone space, that makes sense, but it&apos;s nice to see them appreciate the ingenuity of Android OEMs.</p>

<p><em><strong>"It&apos;s nearly a year old, but the [Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1] is still quite good and brings some solid performance to the Razr Plus."</strong></em></p><p>Motorola went with the slightly older Snapdragon chip in the Razr Plus, which is likely to keep costs down. This seemed very much like a smart move on Motorola&apos;s part, and performance has mostly remained consistently good with the chip. Obviously, the downside is that a year later, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a> is now a generation and a half behind current flagship devices, and in the era of generative AI, it&apos;s starting to show its age.</p><p>Still, overall performance has held up well over the past year, although gaming can cause the phone to heat up quite a bit. Since the bottom half of the phone is vegan leather, only the top half—glass and aluminum—gets hot, which can be quite uncomfortable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-7.jpg" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2023 internal display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUghf2sg5tnb7i42XbVDfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"I will say that the teardrop hinge mechanism on the Razr Plus seems to do wonders with the crease. It&apos;s not nonexistent — tilt the phone just right, and you&apos;ll definitely see it — but it&apos;s not as jarring as I expected it to be."</strong></em></p><p>The foldable display has not failed me in the year I&apos;ve used the phone. The crease is still extremely minimal, especially when compared to the Grand Canyon found on the Galaxy Z Flip 5. I will say that I&apos;ve started to notice very faint lines across the crease, which I imagine are stress fractures that have accumulated after flipping the phone open and shut for a year. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m particularly concerned about them, as they&apos;re very hard to see, and I can barely feel them with my finger, but it&apos;s worth noting if you&apos;re concerned about longevity and durability.</p><p>Dust and other particles will also accumulate in between the screen protector and the display bumper, which I don&apos;t really care for.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 doesn't have the best OLED display, and after some time, it starts to show its age.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The OLED display on the Razr Plus isn&apos;t the best-looking display I&apos;ve ever seen, especially since reviewing more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> over the past year. The display&apos;s Natural mode is too washed out, while the Vibrant mode is too vibrant for my liking. You can adjust the temperature, but this doesn&apos;t help too much. At one point, I tried to get it as close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> as I could, as it&apos;s a <em>much</em> better display, but nothing really worked.</p><p>Still, the 165Hz refresh rate is nice to have when viewing media and playing games, at least indoors or away from direct sunlight. I just wish peak brightness was brighter, as the display can be a little hard to see outdoors, which I believe is partly (or mostly) because of the built-in screen protector.</p>

<p><em><strong>"What I love about the cover screen is that it makes it incredibly easy to use the phone while closed."</strong></em></p><p>This has not changed, and it&apos;s the primary way I prefer to use the phone. The cover screen, while not as bright as I&apos;d like it to be, is still the most useful implementation of a flip phone external display that I&apos;ve come across. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">OPPO Find N3 Flip</a> feels like a wasted opportunity with the vertical cover display, and Samsung makes you go through too many hoops to allow access to your apps.</p><p>Since the phone launched, Motorola has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-razr-40-ultra-receives-update-that-enhances-the-user-experience/">updated the cover screen</a> with more functionality, allowing users to jump straight to the calendar, add more panel shortcuts, access more news stories, and more. My favorite addition is the ability to rotate the cover screen, which can be helpful when navigating certain apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, which enables a different UI in the Now Playing screen.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s still no option to adjust the resolution or refresh rate of the cover screen, which I feel could help reduce battery consumption.</p>

<p><em><strong>"The company promises to support the phone with three OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security updates, which is great for a phone that costs this much. Let&apos;s just hope Motorola can actually live up to the promise."</strong></em></p><p>As we all know, Motorola has not been the best when it comes to software updates. Things seem to have improved ever so slightly, but it still remains an issue if you&apos;re going to consider a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>. To its credit, the company has been pretty consistent in keeping a bi-monthly update cadence, which has been the case with the Razr Plus. Some of these updates have even included new UI tweaks and features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/experience-seamless-connectivity-with-smart-connect/">Smart Connect</a> (which is something of a Ready For rebrand).</p><p>Aside from that, many of the updates are small and just give the phone a security bump, usually with the previous month&apos;s patches. It&apos;s not phenomenal, but at least it&apos;s consistent.</p><p>The problem is with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Most Android OEMs have rolled out the OS upgrade to all, if not most, of their devices by now. Meanwhile, the update has only appeared on a small handful of Motorola devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-review">Stylus 5G 2023</a>. The Razr Plus is somehow still without Android 14, which is a bit ridiculous at this point.</p><p>Stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> is fast approaching, as the beta has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-3-platform-stability-rollout">just reached platform stability</a>. At this rate, the Razr Plus will receive Android 14 when other devices start getting Android 15, and it&apos;ll be yet another waiting game.</p><p>I&apos;ll also note that, for some reason, the Motorola Razr Plus still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-gemini-app-still-isnt-available-for-some-phones-why-not">doesn&apos;t have access to the Gemini app</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>"The phone struggles to get through an entire day on a single charge, despite Motorola&apos;s claims, so if you&apos;re a power user, be ready to charge the device at least once during the day and perhaps even twice within 24 hours."</strong></em></p><p>I can&apos;t say everyone has had the same experience as I have when it comes to battery life, but it&apos;s probably my biggest annoyance when it comes to the Razr Plus. Battery life has been consistently abysmal for me, and I won&apos;t even consider going out without making sure the phone is fully charged. And even then, I&apos;m still worried that it will die, so I try to make sure I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable charger</a> on me.</p><p>Battery anxiety like this should not happen in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2023-cameras-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2023: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="reKwdMcFhUgip8q86YfFaT" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-how-its-going-5.jpg" alt="Auto Enhance on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/reKwdMcFhUgip8q86YfFaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>"Don&apos;t get me wrong...the Razr Plus doesn&apos;t take bad photos. It just doesn&apos;t take the best photos either, which, unfortunately, is par for the course when it comes to clamshell foldables."</strong></em></p><p>The cameras have been another weak point for me and is the main reason why I have often considered switching to the Galaxy Z Flip 5. This is also the reason why I normally carry two phones around with me (usually a Pixel), so that I can at least get some decent shots wherever I&apos;m at. The Razr Plus camera is just unreliable.</p><p>Motorola surprised me with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-is-making-photo-editing-effortless-with-auto-enhance-from-google-photos/">update</a> that addressed this. The phone now has an option to apply AI-based Auto Enhance via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, which happens automatically when you take a photo. This gives photos a welcome boost, and you can always toggle it off in the viewfinder if you need to. That said, it still doesn&apos;t do enough for me to rely on this phone&apos;s image quality, especially when taking selfies.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-plus-2023-is-it-still-worth-buying-2">Motorola Razr Plus 2023: Is it still worth buying?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3803px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="nvb5Aw6TxuTWwhAUJtiNsK" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-review-21.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr+ retail box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvb5Aw6TxuTWwhAUJtiNsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3803" height="2137" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, how has the Motorola Razr Plus held up in the year that I&apos;ve used it? Well, it&apos;s a bit of a mixed bag. I still love this phone enough to keep it as my daily driver, and I will boast loudly and proudly when people ask me about it. The cover screen experience is still the best, and I still enjoy the versatility of a flip phone. Plus, Motorola still has some things going for it, like its useful gestures and powerful Smart Connect.</p><p>However, my biggest gripes with the phone still remain. Atrocious battery life and cameras that are okay at best can sometimes ruin the overall experience. For some of you, I can see how these points would deter you from buying the phone.</p><p>To counter that, this is a phone that cost $999 when it launched and has since seen some incredible discounts. Now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/who-needs-prime-day-the-motorola-razr-plus-has-already-crashed-to-its-lowest-price-ever">buy the Motorola Razr Plus for as low as $650</a>, which is about what you&apos;d pay for a standard midrange phone and is even cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. For that price, I think the negatives can be overlooked, just as long as you&apos;re willing to work a bit for a good photo and carry a portable charger around with you.</p><p>Or, you can wait to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>, which will hopefully have addressed many of the problems I&apos;ve had with its predecessor.</p>

<p>Google relaunched the Find My Device network to compete with Apple&apos;s similar item-finding Find My network, with the official roll-out going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">live in April 2024</a>. The idea behind this was to create a web of compatible devices around the world to help you find lost stuff using compatible item trackers.</p><p>This is right up my alley as a professional accessory fiddler, which is why I got my hands on the latest and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">greatest Bluetooth trackers</a> that support the new network. Chipolo and Pebblebee were the first brands to jump on the Find My Device train, so those are the brands I chose for my little experiment.</p><p>We&apos;ve all heard that Google&apos;s Find My Device network is live, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">it isn&apos;t working as expected</a>. Still, I was really hoping that my test would yield positive results to a certain extent. Here&apos;s how it went down.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U" name="google-find-my-device-network-trackers-pebblebee-chipolo-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Various Google Find My Device Bluetooth trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee held in one hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SRB5UNuckEYD6iUD7vE58U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2556" height="1438" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pebblebee was kind enough to send me the Pebblebee Clip for Android, Pebblebee Card for Android, and Pebblebee Tag for Android. Here are the basic specs of the three Bluetooth trackers.</p>

<p>To get a fair understanding of the network, I also reached out to Chipolo for their Google Find My Device compatible trackers. The brand just launched updated versions of its older lineup. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-one-bluetooth-tracker-review">Chipolo ONE Point</a> and the Chipolo CARD Point have been revamped to support Google&apos;s new network.</p>

<p>Both brands offer your typical circular trackers with keyholes as well as card-shaped ones. In addition to these, Pebblebee offers a tiny tag that comes with a silicone mold and double-sided adhesive tape. You can either attach the tag to your pet&apos;s collar using the silicone holder or use the sticky tape to attach it to something like a TV remote.</p><p>In essence, Pebblebee and Chipolo&apos;s Find My Device trackers are nearly identical in terms of functionality. You set each tracker up using your Android phone and each brand&apos;s respective <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android app</a>. The app automatically helps you add your tracker to the Google Find My Device app.</p><p>I found Chipolo&apos;s app to be a tad faster while setting up new trackers. Meanwhile, Pebblebee&apos;s trackers have better response and a wider Bluetooth range. Bear in mind that Chipolo&apos;s trackers are louder than Pebblebee&apos;s. They all sport splash-proof water resistance across the board.</p><p>What&apos;s really cool is that Pebblebee&apos;s trackers are rechargeable using plain old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cables</a> or magnetic-pin-to-USB-C cables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3531px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK" name="Pebblebee-Clip-google-find-my-device-tracker-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Pebblebee Clip for Android compatible with the Google Find My Device network, attached to a car key." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V5FH6M5hinMGoe6h9tFuMK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3531" height="1986" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After setting up the Google Find My Device trackers, you name and attach them to things that matter. What I ended up doing with all five of my trackers was dividing each one among my friends and asking them not to disclose their location to me. I wanted to locate them randomly using the power of Google&apos;s network, and my friends could then confirm whether the network was correct or not.</p><p>Everything worked out fine and dandy while the trackers were within my phone&apos;s Bluetooth range. However, the minute I was out of range, the network lost them immediately. At this point, I decided it was time to turn things up a notch.</p><p>The next day, I marked all Bluetooth trackers as lost. Surely, at least one of the five trackers would be found over the next few days? Shockingly, three whole days passed before I heard anything back.</p><p>And get this: it wasn&apos;t even the network that helped me find my "lost" trackers. I happened to have dinner with my friends and had forgotten that some of them were carrying my trackers. Midway through my meal, a notification on my phone alerted me that one of my lost trackers was found and was nearby.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rXEnfLMRkn3xTMDSLvpx2T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was under the impression that the network would work spectacularly well, seeing as how Android devices are massively popular in the Asian region where I am based.</p><p>Going off of my expectations versus reality, I soon realized that the presence of Android devices is not enough for the Find My Device network to be successful. My colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">Brady Snyder did a fine job explaining this</a>.</p><p>Although the majority of all Android and Google Fast Pair devices can use Google&apos;s new network, not many choose to contribute to the crowdsourcing network. Limited contribution and participation are killing what could be a fantastic anonymous way of item tracking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5" name="google-find-my-device-app-screenshots-2.jpg" alt="Google Find My Device network app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJLvbMZRiqnjQcBntwG6P5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, Google offers too many options for participating in the Find My Device network. This was designed to protect user privacy, so I can&apos;t really fault them for that, but it doesn&apos;t really make sense, seeing as how device location data contributions are anonymous and encrypted.</p><p>Apart from this confusing variety of options to contribute to the network, there&apos;s also the fact that a lot of people simply haven&apos;t set up the Find My Device feature on their Android devices yet. It&apos;s not on everyone&apos;s list of first things to do with their new Android phone, and some people don&apos;t even know about the feature, which is a whole other problem.</p><p>So, what can be done to fix this? As controversial as it might sound, Google needs to find a way to make more Android users contribute to its crowdsourcing network if its Find My Device network is going to reach its full potential. If people choose not to be part of the network, it will fail as an item-finding network by design. And with that in mind, there will be no point in upgrading your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a> to the latest variants either. Since contributions to the crowdfunded Find My Device network are anonymous anyway, why give people so many chances to opt out of its more useful feature?</p>

<ul><li>Google patched a serious security issue for Pixel devices with the release of the June Pixel Feature Drop last week.</li><li>Though the flaw affects more Android devices, non-Pixel devices will have to wait for Android 15.</li><li>This decision leaves Android devices vulnerable to an actively-exploited flaw for months.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last week, Google finally addressed a critical security flaw that researchers and security advocates have been raising awareness of since April. The problem? Google included the fix in the June Pixel Feature Drop, and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> aren&apos;t able to receive the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-patches-exploited-android-zero-day-on-pixel-devices/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a> first reported the patch, and the team at GrapheneOS — who first reported the vulnerability — confirmed that non-Pixel devices will need to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> to get a fix.</p><p>Google patched 50 security vulnerabilities in the Android 14 QPR3 update for Pixels. However, one stands out because it is a zero-day vulnerability. This means that the flaw was actively exploited in the wild before Google became aware of it. Zero-day security vulnerabilities are the most severe, and thus, Google recommends that all Pixel users apply the June update as soon as possible. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's fixed on Pixels with the June update (Android 14 QPR3) and will be fixed on other Android devices when they eventually update to Android 15. If they don't update to Android 15, they probably won't get the fix, since it has not been backported. Not all patches are backported.<a href="https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294252925927728">June 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The company shared this information on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2024-06-01" target="_blank">Pixel Update Bulletin</a>, which is where Google provides updates on security problems affecting Pixel devices or Android. "There are indications that CVE-2024-32896 may be under limited, targeted exploitation," the company explains. According to GrapheneOS, the actively-exploited CVE-2024-32896 refers to the same exploit that was previously reported as CVE-2024-29748. The new identifier represents the Pixel-exclusive fix that was included in the June update. </p><p>The issue is an elevation of privilege (EoP) problem with Android firmware that Google referred to as of "high severity" for Pixels. </p><p>"It was exploited by forensics companies against users with apps like Wasted and Sentry trying to wipe the device when detecting an attack," the GrapheneOS team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1801294115407106186">explained</a>. "We addressed it as part of making our duress PIN/password feature and reported it to get Google to fix it across Android, which is now done." </p><p>The developers add that two core problems are making the exploit possible. The first is system memory not being erased when entering fast boot mode, meaning that it&apos;s possible for an exploit to access older system memory. A separate but related issue centers around the Android Open Source Project device admin API needing reboot-to-recovery to erase — though this has been fixed in Android 14 QPR3.</p><p>The first problem was previously fixed on Pixels, and the second was fixed in the June Pixel Feature Drop. However, as we&apos;ve mentioned, Pixel phones and tablets are the only ones that receive the fix. That&apos;s because of the way that Android OEMs release software updates and fixes, and it isn&apos;t entirely Google&apos;s fault. </p>
<h2 id="why-other-android-phones-aren-apos-t-getting-a-fix-2">Why other Android phones aren&apos;t getting a fix</h2>

<p>Considering that this issue was actively exploited and has a high severity, you&apos;re probably wondering why other Android devices aren&apos;t getting a fix. After all, Google is advising Pixel users to update their devices ASAP to protect themselves. The truth is that Google has done its part, and it&apos;s up to the other OEMs to implement a fix. The company included the patch in Android 14 QPR3, and any device that receives the Android 14 QPR3 update will get it. </p><p>Fixes like this one are often added to the Android Open Source Project, or AOSP, which serves as the basis for other versions of Android. An operating system like Samsung&apos;s One UI or OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS uses AOSP as the groundwork. The issue is that third-party operating systems usually apply AOSP upgrades yearly. So, Samsung will likely use the AOSP version of Android 15 as the basis for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-early-testing-spotted">One UI 7</a>. However, a future version of Android 15 QPR2 or Android 15 QPR3 wouldn&apos;t impact Samsung Galaxy devices until One UI 8. </p><p>In other words, the reason Google Pixel devices are the only ones to get this patch are because they&apos;re the only ones to receive monthly, quarterly, and yearly updates. Theoretically, a company could take the fix included in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr3-beta-2-2">Android 14 QPR3</a> and apply it to their phones. However, since other OEMs don&apos;t do quarterly updates, the security patches included in Android 14 QPR3 won&apos;t hit their devices until Android 15. </p><p>Some security patches are seeded to older versions of Android through a process called backporting. This doesn&apos;t happen for every patch, though. Google probably should have backported the fix for this security flaw, keeping in mind the severity and its zero-day status. However, it&apos;s not necessarily Google&apos;s responsibility to do so. Additionally, only half of the security issues are related to AOSP. No one can solve the first issue described above except each manufacturer itself. </p><p>This is the latest example of how choosing an Android phone from a brand other than Google can put a user at a security risk. Other brands are too slow to respond to critical zero-day flaws with patches, and it&apos;s a real problem. Sometimes, the blame lies with Google and others with the partner OEMs, and it&apos;s often a mix of both. Either way, the users suffer.</p>

<ul><li>Tipster Ice Universe has shared some exciting details about the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim.</li><li>It is a thinner, lighter, and bigger alternative to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, launching in China as Galaxy W25.</li><li>The tipster indicates that the slimmer Galaxy foldable will launch in October, and not at the upcoming July Unpacked event.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung&apos;s anticipated Galaxy Unpacked event is only a couple of weeks away. We should see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 next to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 during the launch event. Several rumors have been regarding another Galaxy Z Fold 6 model over the past few months; however, new information indicates it is likely to launch in October. </p><p>The device in question is the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, another foldable device from Samsung. Well-known leaker Ice Universe on X has shared some interesting details about the foldable of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim. As the name suggests, it will be thinner, lighter, and larger than the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 6 and will be renamed Galaxy W25 in China, notes Ice Universe. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Z Fold6 Slim will be named Samsung W25 in China, which is lighter, thinner and larger than Fold6.Will be released in October and does not support SPen.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1803016380838551887">June 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The tipster further indicates that it will be launched in October, although it didn&apos;t specify whether it is for the Chinese market or other regions. Also, it will be missing an important feature, which is the support for S-Pen, unlike the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> that support it.</p><p>In the accompanying interactions with the comments on the aforementioned X post, Ice Universe has shared that it wouldn&apos;t be some kind of Fan Edition device. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim will also have a solid build, as it utilizes the premium titanium frame.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim details are still scarce, although this isn&apos;t the first time we have heard about it. Late last month, prominent display analyst Ross Young <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-fold-6-slim-expected-to-launch-in-2025">shared details</a> of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Slim, which slightly differ from today&apos;s Ice Universe claims.</p><p>While Young also hinted that the Z Fold 6 Slim will have a bigger display than the original Z Fold 6 next to no S-Pen support, he noted that the alleged device won&apos;t launch until next year, as its display panel will be shipping in the fourth quarter of this year. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-stick-to-two-galaxy-foldables-as-before">latest report</a> from South Korea claimed that Samsung is sticking with the same two foldables this year, citing a lack of differentiation factors.</p><p>While it will be encouraging to have more foldables phone options from Samsung to consider next to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Z Flip 6</a>, rumors regarding the Z Fold 6 Slim are becoming speculative at this point. </p><p>Given the tipster&apos;s solid credibility, if the prediction regarding the new Slim foldable phone is accurate, it would be an interesting option to look forward to, even if it likely turns out to be a pricer.</p>

<ul><li>An APK dive into the Google app's latest beta shows the company's early development of an audio lookup feature.</li><li>Concrete details are scarce, however, speculation suggests the function could let Circle to Search run an audio query based on sounds from your device.</li><li>Circle to Search was previously tipped to pick up new features for "copying" and sharing highlighted snapshots alongside split-screen support.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery shows that Google could implement a way for its Circle to Search to handle audio queries.</p><p>An APK dive conducted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug/status/1803036529839030335">AssembleDebug</a> in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/circle-to-search-audio-search-apk-teardown-3452225/">Android Authority</a> shows evidence of a new audio option. The tipster discovered the feature in beta version 15.24.28.29 of the Google app on Android.</p><p>When activating Circle to Search, the feature displays a new music note icon between the manual search box and the Google Translate icon.</p><p>Details about the feature&apos;s functionality are scarce as the tipster couldn&apos;t get it to function properly. However, speculation suggests the note&apos;s icon could let <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> listen in on what your device is playing and that as a query. This could be useful as another way of discovering music heard through a social media app or anywhere else on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>.</p><p>What&apos;s also unclear is if users can let Circle to Search listen in on a segment of audio <em>and </em>attach extra written context in the bar. This is already a possibility as the feature captures what&apos;s been circled with the option of adding a bit of text to help refine Google&apos;s search.</p><p>The tipster needed to manually surface the note&apos;s UI button, however, with so little information it&apos;s likely Google&apos;s still in early development.</p>

<p>There&apos;s more in development for Google&apos;s Circle to Search as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-new-options-spotted">a previous APK dive</a> showed updates for sharing and editing. Regarding the former, the app&apos;s code showed the feature may let users circle a section but opt to share that highlighted portion with others through the sub-menu instead of running a query.</p><p>The latter "copy" what they&apos;ve circled and throw it into their device&apos;s photo editor to spruce it up, add annotations, or share through Messages and more.</p><p>Another discovery during Android 15 beta showed that Google plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-phones-may-soon-let-you-use-circle-to-search-in-split-screen-mode">bring split-screen support</a> to it for Pixel phones. This would allow Pixel owners to use two apps at once <em>and </em>leverage Circle to Search&apos;s assistance for quick queries without having to swap around.</p><p>Moreover, it seems as though the lack of support was more of an internal development bug as supported Samsung phones don&apos;t have a problem.</p>

Its battery life turned out to be great as well—thanks to its fast charging speeds. We expect the same, if not a better version, whenever it lands in the U.S. market. </p>

<ul><li>YouTube appears to be testing a feature that will add notes at the bottom of the video.</li><li>This aims to provide sources and relevant information to viewers about the video, making it easier for them to spot fake/altered videos on the platform.</li><li>This is being rolled out to US people who will start seeing notes on videos in the "coming weeks and months." </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-ways-to-offer-viewers-more-context/">announced</a> on Monday (June 17) that it is testing a feature to allow people to add notes and provide relevant and easily understandable context to their videos on the platform. </p><p>The blog post explains that YouTube could include notes that clarify when a song is a parody, or a new version of a product being reviewed is available, or let viewers know when older footage is mistakenly portrayed as a current event. This will make it easier for viewers to spot fake or altered videos/news on the platform.</p><p>This feature looks similar to Community Notes on X, which provides a disclaimer right below the tweet to inform users that the post is misleading or lacks information—providing links to additional sources on the web.</p><p>YouTube says it will invite a limited number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14925346#zippy=%2Cwho-has-access-to-write-notes%2Cwhy-can-i-see-notes-on-videos-even-though-i-cant-write-them%2Cwhat-happens-to-my-note-after-i-submit-it%2Ccan-i-check-the-status-of-my-notes%2Chow-do-i-delete-a-note%2Cdo-i-need-to-sign-up-to-write-notes-and-how-do-i-know-if-im-off-the-waitlist%2Cwho-rates-notes">eligible</a> contributors who will write notes on these videos to help them test this feature before expanding it on a larger scale. </p><p>To be eligible to participate in this test, users should have created their account six or more months ago, haven&apos;t had any community guidelines strike in the past year, and aren&apos;t supervised or have a brand/school account containing multiple users. It&apos;s important to note that these YouTube accounts need to be based in the United States and have their language set to English.</p><p>"These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9230586?sjid=7456120448090610509-NC" target="_blank">third-party evaluators</a> are the same people who provide feedback on YouTube’s search results and recommendations," the blog states.</p><p>Also, these contributors will appear as "anonymous" on YouTube&apos;s notes, so they won&apos;t have to worry about being &apos;exposed&apos; per se. The company says that as the pilot project expands, contributors themselves can rate notes as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.00%;"><img id="CDtH5yfSuGorZbQCdE9s5E" name="YouTube-notes-.jpg" alt="YouTube tests notes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDtH5yfSuGorZbQCdE9s5E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="744" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube says that Notes will appear publicly under a video if they’re helpful to a wide range of audiences. </p><p>Under a video, viewers will be given options to choose if they found the note “helpful,” “somewhat helpful,” or “unhelpful” and why. Allowing users to share their thoughts about whether the note cites the right sources or is written clearly and neutrally. </p><p>"From there, we’ll use a bridging-based algorithm to consider these ratings and determine what notes are published," the blog added.</p><p>YouTube says that people in the US will start to see notes on videos in the "coming weeks and months."</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (June 18), Google is detailing its latest Android 15 beta update for developers and users involved.</p><p>According to Google, its Android 15 Beta 3 rollout brings the upcoming major OS release into "Platform Stability" right on schedule. With that, there are only a few things testers and developers should look out for, like passkey and Credential Manager updates.</p><p>Google is letting enrolled testers in on single-step sign-in capabilities through biometrics like facial recognition, fingerprint, or screen lock. Previously, users were given two sub-menus: one asking about a "saved passkey" for a given service and another for their biometrics. Now, users will see one unified sub-menu detailing the service they&apos;re signing into and a prompt for their fingerprint or the option to use a PIN.</p><p>The company states that if a user accidentally dismisses the app&apos;s prompt to use a passkey, the Credential Manager will display autofill suggestions on their keyboard.</p>

<p>For developers, the post states they can deliver Credential Manager API requests through the inline autofill fallback UI or its dropdown menu. This is all done through the user&apos;s keyboard, as previously mentioned.</p><p>Google states it has now depreciated WebSettings (WebSQL) in Android WebView with Beta 3. These settings no longer appear in Chrome, either. Additionally, the company will look to turn the methods into a "no-op" on all Android software versions "in the next 12 months."</p><p>The update&apos;s rollout also encourages app developers to prepare their products, libraries, tools, and game engines for Android 15. Google hopes devs will prepare their apps for the new "FLAG_STOPPED" changes that ensure apps remain stopped until a user&apos;s manual input is detected. Support for 16KB pages, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/gmail-gets-predictive-back-feature-on-android-14">predictive back animations</a>, and support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> are items to keep an eye on even if developers aren&apos;t yet targeting Android 15.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 3 is rolling out now to all enrolled testers and supported devices. Those with a Pixel phone can check which devices can join the testing environment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">and get started</a>.</p><p>The last Android 15 beta update came via a minor patch labeled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-2-private-spaces-nfc-fixes">Beta 2.2</a> early in June. The original Beta 2 update was frustrating as enrolled testers quickly let Google know. Beta 2.2 continued to hammer away at some of those pesky problems plaguing Private Spaces and some devices&apos; NFC capabilities no longer functioning. Other problems regarding the app drawer and HDR were also targeted.</p><p>Google is right on time in reaching Platform Stability for its next major OS release in June. We should continue to get updates, most likely to iron out any problems until Beta 4 arrives in July. From there, we&apos;ll see where the road takes us.</p>
