                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Figuring out how to change screen brightness on Wear OS is a breeze once you know how. Of course, different Wear OS watches have slightly different methods and settings, depending on whether you&apos;re rocking a Samsung Galaxy Watch, a Pixel Watch, or any other brand.</p><p>To teach you how, we&apos;ll run through most of the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> running Wear OS 3 or 4, and the other screen brightness settings you need to know.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-change-screen-brightness-on-wear-os-2">How to change screen brightness on Wear OS</h2>
<p>To answer this question, we checked four Wear OS watches — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">Ticwatch Pro 5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> — since each has distinct UI and settings choices. That said, when it comes to screen brightness, they all use the same simple method:</p><p>1. <strong>Swipe down</strong> from the top of your Wear OS watch display.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>sun icon</strong>.</p><p>3a. On the <strong>Galaxy Watch</strong>, slide your finger along the arc to adjust the brightness up or down.</p><p>3b. On the <strong>Pixel Watch</strong>, <strong>Ticwatch Pro 5</strong>, or <strong>OnePlus Watch 2</strong>, tap the <strong>+</strong> or <strong>–</strong> buttons to switch between brightness settings. You&apos;ll also find a toggle for <strong>Auto brightness</strong> you can turn on or off.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nkeUdWzGx5goyytrL6iasH" name="galaxy-watch-6-screen-brightness-settings.jpg" alt="Galaxy Watch 6 screenshots showing how to adjust screen brightness, turn on adaptive brightness, or edit your Quick Settings to add brightness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nkeUdWzGx5goyytrL6iasH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Galaxy Watch 6 screenshots for brightness and adaptive brightness settings </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s it! Samsung lets you choose whatever screen brightness option you want, which we appreciate; OnePlus and Ticwatch offer five brightness settings, while the Pixel Watch 2 only has three.</p><p>On the Galaxy Watch 6, you can only turn on <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> in the Settings. <strong>Tap and hold</strong> the brightness icon to pull up the Display settings, then toggle adaptive brightness on.</p><p>Also, since you can edit your Galaxy Watch quick settings, you may want to move your brightness icon, or re-add it if you deleted it by mistake. <strong>Swipe down</strong>, then <strong>swipe left </strong>until you find and tap the <strong>+ icon</strong>. You can now drag the brightness icon to where you want, or tap the <strong>+</strong> sign to add it back onto your menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MNEMoLucaEHxketxpvtHZH" name="pixel-watch-display-brightness-screenshots.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 screenshots showing how to adjust display brightness or turn on Sunlight Boost." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNEMoLucaEHxketxpvtHZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pixel Watch 2 screenshots for brightness and Sunlight Boost </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel Watch 2 has a <strong>Sunlight Boost</strong> mode for better brightness outdoors. To make sure it&apos;s toggled on, swipe down from your watch face and tap the <strong>Settings cog icon</strong>. Select <strong>Display > Sunlight Boost</strong> and turn it on (or off, if you&apos;re trying to save battery while out and about).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VbA6BdHX4v4jNZ5k9B9DgH" name="sleep-modes-wear-os-screenshots.jpg" alt="Wear OS screenshots showing "Sleep" or "Bedtime" modes on Pixel Watch 2 and Galaxy Watch 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbA6BdHX4v4jNZ5k9B9DgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you&apos;re more concerned about keeping your watch dim or dark so it doesn&apos;t wake you at night, you should look into <strong>Sleep</strong> or <strong>Bedtime mode</strong>. It disables Raise to Wake and keeps brightness at a lower setting, but switches back automatically to your previous brightness setting once you turn the mode off.</p><p>On the <strong>Galaxy Watch</strong>, swipe down to Quick Settings, tap the <strong>Checkmark icon</strong>, then select <strong>Sleep</strong>. The display will dim significantly until you tap <strong>Turn off</strong> from the main watch face. On the <strong>Pixel Watch 2</strong>, swipe down to Quick Settings, then tap the <strong>Moon & stars</strong> icon. Other Wear OS watches have similar moon or bed icons for their respective modes.</p>

<p>As we said, adjusting your smartwatch&apos;s screen brightness is easy, but using adaptive brightness or a Sleep/ Bedtime function is a better option so you&apos;re not constantly having to adjust your display every morning and evening. Hopefully, you&apos;re all set now!</p><p>One reason to change your watch display brightness is to try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-extend-battery-life-wear-os">to extend the battery life on your Wear OS watch</a>.

Despite three years between the original Roam and this presumed sequel, the two share a lot in common.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-sonos-roam-2-price-and-availability"><span>Sonos Roam 2: Price and availability</span></h3>
<p>Sonos launched the Roam 2 in May 2024 and it should be widely available until the company retires the speaker, which probably won&apos;t happen until a newer model comes along. It starts at $179, a modest $10 increase over what the original Roam cost when it came out in 2021. You&apos;ll be able to find it from a variety of retailers, including Sonos&apos; own website. It comes in Black, White, Sunset, Wave, and Olive.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-sonos-roam-2-what-s-good"><span>Sonos Roam 2: What's good</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mnua3k6rH3zMQmEtxa7sgE" name="Sonos-Roam-2-back.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 rear view showing power and Bluetooth buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnua3k6rH3zMQmEtxa7sgE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sonos chose to stick to a familiar design with the Roam 2. So familiar, in fact, that you have to know the distinct differences to notice. The color options mirror those launched for the original Roam, only the second-gen speakers don&apos;t have the logo emblazoned in white on all colors (it is for the white variant, though).</p><p>You&apos;ll also notice a dedicated Bluetooth button in the rear. This solves a nagging issue where you had to hold down the power button on the previous model for an exact number of seconds to put it into pairing mode — invariably turning it off when you missed the mark. The Roam 2 only requires you to hold down the Bluetooth button to do that. And if you need to switch between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi mode, you just need to press it once.</p><p>Apart from that, there&apos;s not much else to separate the Roam 2 from a physical standpoint. It has the same chassis, layout, weight, and IP67 dust and water resistance as its predecessor. It supports wireless charging the same way when you place it upright and put the bottom of the speaker onto a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">Qi-enabled charger</a>. Plus, any accessories made for the original Roam will fit right in with this one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4daWfQKbfYnnnq59xVhC4F" name="Sonos-Roam-2-buttons.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 speaker top view of buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4daWfQKbfYnnnq59xVhC4F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Roam 2 launched with less fanfare, partly because Sonos also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">released its first pair of headphones in the Ace</a>. Except, the Ace can&apos;t be part of a Sonos system the way the Roam 2 can. Adding the speaker to a Sonos system is easy and only takes minutes to confirm and complete. Indeed, the process is pretty much the same as it always was despite Sonos&apos; redesigned app.</p><p>All the familiarity extends to the controls, which are situated in exactly the same spots. The play/pause button is flanked by volume buttons on either side, along with a microphone button up top. When the LED above it is on (and you&apos;ve set up voice control in the Sonos app) you can use either Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. Missing in action is Google Assistant, a feature the original Roam still maintains. Until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sonos-versus-google-patent-infringement-case">Sonos and Google resolve their legal issues</a> after a judge threw out a judgment against Google in October 2023, its voice assistant won&apos;t be doing any talking. </p><p>At least the speaker won&apos;t take issue with splashes of water. The Roam 2 doesn&apos;t look like a ruggedized speaker but its IP67 rating is pretty tough by speaker standards. Using this by the pool or tub shouldn&apos;t be a problem. Stay away from saltwater and remember that it&apos;s more water-resistant than waterproof. You can submerge it for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r4XNar8E7aTLvsCWvRVJAJ" name="Sonos-Roam-2-with-Roam-1.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 next to Roam 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r4XNar8E7aTLvsCWvRVJAJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the music plays, Sonos&apos; tuning clearly focuses on clarity without skewing too far one way or the other in the audio spectrum. It&apos;s par for the course for Sonos at this point, and it offers Trueplay as a way to tune the audio based on where you&apos;re actually playing music through the Roam 2.</p><p>It&apos;s just that this speaker doesn&apos;t sound any different from the original, so there&apos;s no sonic improvement. The app&apos;s EQ only lets you adjust bass, treble, and loudness. Go too far with the bass or loudness, and you lose some of the clarity in the process. Finding the right mix in a certain setting can prove to be a challenge. Worse yet, Sonos still inexplicably doesn&apos;t let you save any presets under the false impression that Trueplay is good enough on its own.</p><p>On the bright side, you can stereo pair a Roam 2 with a Roam 1 to create true stereo sound with left and right channels. The app makes this fairly easy to pull off, and put together, two definitely sound better than one. If you use the Roam 1 as the primary of the two, you can retain Google Assistant as the prime voice assistant, but not if it&apos;s the other way around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5hkKtw4sVJoTTRJaxttxVF" name="Sonos-Roam-2-in-hand.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 speaker in hand at park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5hkKtw4sVJoTTRJaxttxVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sonos rates battery life at up to 10 hours per charge, but you likely won&apos;t get there. That&apos;s at default volume and it&apos;s unclear if Sonos means Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. You&apos;re more likely to hit the seven-to-eight-hour range if you regularly raise the volume higher either way. That&apos;s not great but also not bad considering the tech involved here.</p><p>The app lets you take some control in mitigating battery loss. You can choose how long it takes for the speaker to turn off due to inactivity, and a Wi-Fi Power Save toggle saves power whenever the Roam 2 is connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AGKCe9DsP53yvwMaFMXA4H" name="Sonos-Roam-2-upright.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 upright outside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGKCe9DsP53yvwMaFMXA4H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the first Roam launched in 2021, it stood out as a superb portable speaker that could extend Sonos&apos; sonic presence beyond the home. Three years later, competitors manage to either offer better value relative to price or find ways to surpass the audio output available here. It&apos;s just odd Sonos chose not to at least try to make the Roam 2 sound better than its predecessor.</p><p>If you&apos;re into bass-heavy music, don&apos;t bother with this speaker because it will disappoint you that way. While highs and mids are pretty good for the size, they lose some of their resonance when you pump up the bass. You&apos;re then left with a choice to make if you&apos;re after a certain type of sound.</p><p>Not only that but SBC and AAC are your only Bluetooth codecs, so forget any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> playback outside of Wi-Fi connections at home. Not to mention it&apos;s Bluetooth 5.0, a fairly outdated standard for something that costs this much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zGCQkWJK4RZcYaCHpTDDcH" name="Sonos-Roam-2-voice-control.jpg" alt="Sonos Roam 2 voice control setup with Sonos app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGCQkWJK4RZcYaCHpTDDcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These drawbacks don&apos;t apply to a variety of portable speakers currently available, some of which very much undercut Sonos in price. Granted, those are Bluetooth speakers without any Wi-Fi compatibility, but it&apos;s still hard to ignore the comparisons.</p><p>As a smart speaker, certain roadblocks also pop up. You can use Alexa as the voice assistant, only it can&apos;t actually play music by request for you. This will feel strange when you encounter it because you can control smart home devices by voice. Ask it to play a song, album, or playlist, however, and it can&apos;t do it. Even if Amazon is partly to blame for that, it makes the absence of Google Assistant all the more glaring. Sonos Voice Control is terribly limited and not a true alternative.</p><p>Sonos doesn&apos;t enable multipoint connections, so two devices can&apos;t pair with it at once. When stereo pairing, you need Wi-Fi to facilitate the connection, making it all but impossible to do it away from home. Thus, if you want to use a stereo pair to serenade your group or BBQ at the park, your Roam 2 will have to fly solo.</p>

<p>The Roam 2 stands out among the best Sonos speakers because it&apos;s the smallest in the lineup, but when it comes to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best Bluetooth speakers</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-move-2-review">Sonos Move 2</a> is the company&apos;s better option. It&apos;s much bigger, yet still mobile enough within a home, and delivers sound that trounces the Roam 2 in every audible form. If you&apos;re willing to take it to the park or host people in a backyard, it will have no problem handling a crowd.</p><p>For something closer to the Roam 2&apos;s own size, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 packs a real punch, especially when it comes to bass response. For clearer sound with a real presence, the Marshall Emberton II frankly sounds better. Both of those come in cheaper on top of that. If you want bassy sound with a light show to go with it, the JBL Pulse 5 is unique in the category.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want a wireless speaker to take with you</li>
  <li>You are already in the Sonos ecosystem</li>
  <li>You like the convenience of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</li>
  <li>You already own a Roam speaker and want to stereo pair</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want hi-res audio playback</li>
  <li>You want booming bass</li>
  <li>You want Google Assistant</li>
  <li>You prefer to spend less</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The Sonos Roam 2 isn&apos;t a real sequel when it comes down to the sum of its parts. The upgrades, such as they are, feel more like incremental tweaks, giving me the impression this speaker was more like a Roam 1.5 than a 2. The biggest reason is that it doesn&apos;t sound any different and offers no credible improvement in Bluetooth range or quality.</p><p>This is a little confusing considering Sonos re-engineered its Era speakers to cut above the previous One and Play models. By contrast, the Move 2 feels like a much more substantial upgrade compared to its own predecessor. That doesn&apos;t all mean the Roam 2 is terrible. It&apos;s a solid, very portable speaker. It just doesn&apos;t stand out a whole lot from the one that came before it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I usually recommend budget home NAS servers if you&apos;re just getting started with the category; they give you a great overview of what&apos;s available with storage servers, and the affordability means you don&apos;t have to invest too much cash to get started. There&apos;s no shortage of choice in this regard, and in recent years, ASUSTOR has delivered a lot of good options in the entry-level and budget categories.</p><p>The AS3302T v2 is its latest showing, and it ticks a lot of the right boxes. It is powered by Realtek&apos;s RTD1619B platform and is noticeably faster than its predecessor, and you get 2GB of RAM, 8GB embedded flash storage, and three USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="s6yULt5ZrKbyAfKyQcmvve" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-6.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s6yULt5ZrKbyAfKyQcmvve.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key talking point is the connectivity; the AS3302T v2 has a single 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port at the back, and that gives it a distinct advantage over just about any other NAS in this segment. ASUSTOR routinely offers multi-Gigabit connectivity on its mid-range servers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">AS5402T</a>, but to see a 2.5GbE port in this segment is a welcome move. The AS3302T v2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Asustor-Drivestor-AS3302T-v2-Quad-Core/dp/B0CHYPGX1M">retails for $269 on Amazon</a>, so it goes up against the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WzwhpnVA22A6Vo4AaMcpEe" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-2.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WzwhpnVA22A6Vo4AaMcpEe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You don&apos;t usually see any major design changes with NAS servers, and ASUSTOR didn&apos;t change the overall aesthetic to any noticeable degree with the AS3302T v2. The NAS has the same design as most of the brand&apos;s 2-bay servers, with a magnetic panel covering the drive bays.</p><p>The panel has a geometric pattern and the ASUSTOR logo, and it attaches securely to the NAS. The dual drive bays have a tool-less installation — which hasn&apos;t always been the case with ASUSTOR — and they slot in standard 3.5-inch drives or 2.5-inch drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hSc6P5KkuYNwHSfPbC357e" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-3.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hSc6P5KkuYNwHSfPbC357e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s the usual array of status indicators located below the power button to the left, and on the whole, the AS3302T v2 has a familiar design. The build quality is good, and the fan at the back ensures the drives don&apos;t overheat under heavy loads. What&apos;s good to see is that ASUSTOR offers the same three-year warranty as its mid-range servers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yCSD5HSC9EQXedMi5Kssde" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-5.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yCSD5HSC9EQXedMi5Kssde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUSTOR is usually generous with port selection, but the AS3302T v2 doesn&apos;t have an HDMI port or dual Ethernet connectivity. That&apos;s not a huge omission given that you get a 2.5GbE port at the back, and other than that, there are two USB ports along with a USB-A connector at the front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yUuP4EPaqH83gX26kazCNe" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-4.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yUuP4EPaqH83gX26kazCNe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ASUSTOR is still using a Realtek platform with the AS3302T v2, but the RTD1619B goes up to 1.7GHz, and is a good choice. It isn&apos;t quite as powerful as the Intel Celeron-backed products in this category, but as a daily workhorse, I didn&apos;t see any issues. You get a native Plex utility, and again, it is good enough to stream content to connected devices on your home network.</p><p>The AS3302T v2 has 2GB of soldered memory, and there isn&apos;t a slot to add more down the line should you need it. Similarly, you don&apos;t get M.2 slots, so if you want to use SSD storage, you&apos;ll need to get 2.5-inch drives instead. While 2GB of RAM is adequate in daily use, I would have liked the ability to extend the memory, but the bigger omission is NVMe storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7XQjAdtJb9sAcRAGNd43We" name="asustor-as3302t-v2-8.jpg" alt="ASUSTOR AS3302T v2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XQjAdtJb9sAcRAGNd43We.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the AS3302T v2 has plenty to offer in its own right, and ASUSTOR&apos;s software comes with a ton of useful features. You get container management, video and audio utilities designed to make it easy to access your media collection from anywhere, and back up vital data with ease.</p>
<p>I slotted in two 6TB IronWolf drives into the AS3302T v2, and the 2.5GbE connection is able to maximize the bandwidth of the drives — I routinely saw transfers averaging 214MB/s. Link Aggregation would have achieved similar results, but I like that there&apos;s multi-Gigabit connectivity as standard.</p><p>I&apos;d still prefer the DiskStation DS224+ in this category as it has better software and standout mobile clients — it continues to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS server</a> around. Having said that, the AS3302T v2 is a good alternative if you want to maximize value.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Apple was reportedly in talks with Meta about bringing new AI-powered features to iPhones in a partnership. </li><li>The company already partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. </li><li>Apple could be trying to compete with Google Gemini integration on Android by offering multiple AI systems on its platforms.</li><li>A new report from Bloomberg says that Apple isn't considering a Meta deal anymore.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has spent more than a year integrating artificial intelligence into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> with the help of Gemini, and now Apple is trying to do the same with iOS. The company debuted a suite of Apple Intelligence features at WWDC 2024 earlier this month and paired that with an OpenAI partnership. As part of the deal, iPhone users will get access to ChatGPT for free, as an optional addition to Siri. Now, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-meta-have-discussed-an-ai-partnership-cc57437e" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> reveals that Apple has also had talks with Meta about using its AI on the iPhone. </p><p>It&apos;s unclear what the scope of the Apple and Meta partnership would be. According to the report, a deal is not final and could fall through. However, this would align with prior reports that Apple is looking for more AI companies to work with besides OpenAI. The company is said to be having talks with Google and Anthropic about AI services, in addition to the current OpenAI deal and the rumored Meta AI partnership. </p><p>Artificial intelligence has slowly become a focus for Meta, the company best known for its social media sites — including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads — and virtual reality Quest headsets. The company&apos;s Meta AI appeared on the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have quietly become one of the best products with a wearable AI assistant. In April 2024, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">Meta shipped an update</a> to the Meta Ray-Bans that added multimodal AI support to the glasses. </p><p>For the uninitiated, multimodal AI simply means you can interact with the Meta AI assistant in multiple ways. In the case of the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, they can now use vision with the onboard camera in addition to voice. It&apos;s possible that Meta could provide similar functionality on the iPhone with a potential deal. While OpenAI has a GPT-4o modal supporting multimodal input, it seems that the version of ChatGPT on iPhones only supports text. Since the details of a possible Apple/Meta partnership are unconfirmed, this is pure speculation. </p><p>In addition to working on the Meta Ray-Bans, Meta also added a universal Meta AI chatbot to the search bars of its most popular apps. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger</a> all have Meta AI front and center. With these developments, it&apos;s clear that AI is a priority for Meta moving forward. The company has many ways to get Meta AI in front of users. The four apps listed are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/">most-used social apps </a>on the planet. On top of that, it has smart glasses and a VR headset. </p><p>The thing it doesn&apos;t have is a mobile operating system. In order to really compete with Google, Gemini, and Android, Meta will need a way to get its AI assistant in front of smartphone users. It can do this, in part, by leveraging social media apps like Instagram and Facebook. However, partnering with Apple would give it a large iPhone user base, making a deal potentially lucrative for both sides.</p><p>It would seem that the deal may have been more lucrative for Meta than Apple, because Bloomberg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/apple-spurned-idea-of-iphone-ai-partnership-with-meta-months-ago" target="_blank">reported</a> Monday, June 24 that Apple passed on the deal months ago. However, talks did briefly occur, and Apple is still considering companies for AI partnerships.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3635px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B" name="How to use Google Gemini on Android.jpg" alt="Using Google Gemini on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wKHFbNCrVxCorZMzi9J36B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3635" height="2045" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether it&apos;s Meta or another company, it seems likely that Apple will continue looking for someone to partner with for more AI products. It&apos;s an interesting strategy that seems to be the complete opposite of what Google wants to do with Android. Using its own AI chatbot (Gemini) and its own on-device AI model (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-8-8a-receiving-gemini-nano-soon-should-make-you-skeptical-about-update-promise">Gemini Nano</a>), Google wants to keep as many Android artificial intelligence features in-house as possible. </p><p>That&apos;s usually the strategy we see Apple take, prioritizing its ecosystem over third-party collaborations. Now, it&apos;s Google trying to do everything itself, and that&apos;s probably because AI is a big threat to the company&apos;s dominance in search and advertising. Google arguably has more to lose if it doesn&apos;t win with AI than any other big tech company. </p><p>By comparison, Apple is willing to work with anyone it can to make its platforms the most versatile on the market when it comes to AI. It has on-device processing covered with the Neural Engine and Apple Intelligence. For secure cloud processing, the company has Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute. And in a rare move for Apple, the company is admitting when its in-house options aren&apos;t good enough by allowing users to outsource their request to ChatGPT. </p><p>In the future, we could see an iPhone that uses Apple Intelligence, ChatGPT, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Meta AI, and more to handle different tasks. That might make the iPhone&apos;s approach to AI more appealing than Android&apos;s. For now, Android users only have Gemini deeply integrated at the OS level. </p><p>The role reversal should show the differences in priorities for Apple, Meta, and Google. Apple just wants to sell iPhones, and if it needs to partner with multiple AI companies to do that, so be it. Google wants to keep everything in-house, presumably to help train its AI models, serve ads, and collect your data. Meta just wants a place to get Meta AI in front of more users, which is why an Apple deal could make a lot of sense for the company. </p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t look like Apple shares the same sentiment. </p>

<p>Motorola nailed the basics with the Edge 2024, and the phone has a clean design with leather at the back, a good P-OLED panel with vibrant colors and contrast, amazing battery life, 68W charging along with 15W wireless charging, and IP68 ingress protection. The software is clean and has Motorola's usual extras, but it will only get two updates. The biggest drawback is the cameras; they're nowhere as good as the Pixel 8a, and the Qualcomm hardware just doesn't measure up in daily use. It is still a decent option if you prefer Motorola's phone, but the Pixel 8a is an objectively better choice.</p></p>

<p>The Pixel 8a continues to set the standard in the mid-range segment, and it brings much-needed changes: the screen now goes up to 120Hz, the back is made out of glass, and the phone has rounded edges, making it easier to hold and use. You get the best cameras, the best software, seven Android updates, and the best part is that the clean software has plenty of great additions you won't get outside of a Pixel. The device has its share of issues around thermal management, but on the whole, the Pixel 8a is the only mid-range phone worth considering.</p></p>

<p>Motorola hasn&apos;t changed the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Edge 2024</a> too much from last year, and the result is that the phone looks largely identical to its predecessor. The same is true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8ahttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but Google made a few tweaks to the design that make the device easier to hold and use. The Pixel 8a has rounded edges, and it now has an aluminum mid-frame that gives it much better rigidity. What hasn&apos;t changed is the size — the Pixel 8a is noticeably smaller than the Edge 2024, and it feels great in-hand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JMVBRxXhDuTapKdvtTBw5h" name="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-corners-camera-bars-01.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JMVBRxXhDuTapKdvtTBw5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the eco-leather back on the Edge 2024, and it allows the device to stand out a little bit. Although it is larger because of the 6.6-inch screen, it is 14g lighter than the Pixel 8a. There isn&apos;t much in the way of customizability as the device is sold in a single color, so if you need a phone that will turn heads, you should pick up the Pixel 8a in the new Bay variant — the pastel blue hue looks gorgeous, and the texture is delightful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3QtXuJpmvgmtg6qGamSH8g" name="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-side-keys.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3QtXuJpmvgmtg6qGamSH8g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both devices have ingress protection, but Motorola has an edge in this regard as it offers IP68 dust and water resistance — you get IP67 with the Pixel 8a instead. There isn&apos;t an outright winner in the design area, but I prefer the size of the Pixel 8a, so that gets my recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-screen-2">Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a: Screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ahAXLA3HU7yBYitChDBqXg" name="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-02.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ahAXLA3HU7yBYitChDBqXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the screen, the Edge 2024 has a 6.6-inch P-OLED panel with 144Hz refresh and max brightness of 1300 nits in HDR content. If those numbers look familiar, it&apos;s because Motorola is reusing the same panel as last year; that said, it is still a good choice, and you get vibrant colors.</p><p>Google, thankfully, made much-needed tweaks to the panel on the Pixel 8a, and the phone finally goes up to 120Hz. The OLED panel is significantly brighter as well, going up to 2000 nits in HDR content. The smaller 6.1-inch size is ideal if you need a phone that&apos;s usable one-handed, and when it comes to color fidelity, the Pixel 8a does all the right things.</p><p>The only issue in this area is that Google didn&apos;t change the bezels, so the Pixel 8a has sizeable bezels that are bigger than just about any other mid-range device. The Edge 2024 is noticeably sleeker, and Motorola did a great job maximizing the real estate.</p>

<p>The Edge 2024 is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, and Motorola should have ideally used MediaTek instead. The 7s Gen 2 uses the ancient A78 and A55 cores, and it just doesn&apos;t have the power to meet demanding workloads. If anything, there&apos;s noticeable stutter in daily use, and even mundane tasks like launching the camera and taking photos is often laggy.</p><p>The Edge 2024 is sold in a single 8GB/256GB configuration, but it uses older UFS 2.2 storage, so you will see some lag when saving photos to the gallery. Thankfully, the Pixel 8a doesn&apos;t have any such shortcomings; the phone is powered by the same Google Tensor G3 as the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, and it has 8GB of RAM and is available with 128GB and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QaVm8vUQ7TcXxWwzndVhGg" name="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-bottom.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaVm8vUQ7TcXxWwzndVhGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Pixel 8a misses out is thermal management; the phone tends to throttle aggressively while gaming, and it overheats with extended gaming sessions. Continuous 4K video also tends to heat up the phone to a noticeable degree, and this is something that Google needs to address. Outside of that, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the Pixel 8a in daily use.</p><p>The one area where the Edge 2024 has a distinct edge is the battery life; the 5000mAh battery easily manages to last over a day with ease, and you get 68W charging and even 15W wireless charging as standard. The Pixel 8a has a smaller 4492mAh battery, and while it also lasts a day, you will need to plug it in by nighttime. Google still uses the 18W charging standard, so it takes considerably longer to charge the device.</p>

<p>Google has maintained a heady lead in the camera section, and that hasn&apos;t changed this year — the Pixel 8a is still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best mid-range phone</a> if you take a lot of photos and videos. The phone has a 64MP main camera and a 13MP wide-angle lens, and it does an outstanding job in just about any scenario. Google also retained the camera features it introduced last year, so you get all the extras that are a mainstay on the Pixel 8.</p><p>Motorola, meanwhile, hasn&apos;t done enough to differentiate the Edge 2024 in this regard. The main 50MP camera takes good photos in its own right, but it isn&apos;t consistent, and it just doesn&apos;t measure up in situations with little to no ambient lighting. While the camera is usable, you should pick up the Pixel 8a if this is a priority.</p>

<p>Google is once again in the lead when it comes to the software. Both phones run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, but the Edge 2024 will only get two guaranteed platform updates, one less than the industry standard. Google, meanwhile, is offering the same seven-year update guarantee as the Pixel 8 series, and that&apos;s unmatched in this segment — even the Galaxy A55 will pick up just four updates.</p><p>It remains to be seen what software features actually roll out to the device in seven years&apos; time, but there&apos;s no question that the Pixel 8a is the phone to get if you want long-term updates. Then there&apos;s the software itself; while both phones have clean software, the Pixel 8a comes with all of Google&apos;s exclusive AI-assisted features, and they make a genuine difference in daily use. Most of these features are limited to Pixels, and the fact that you don&apos;t miss out on any features present in the standard Pixel 8 makes the 8a just that little bit more enticing.</p><p>Motorola also has a slate of unique features on its devices, but the brand really needs to do more with software updates. The brand isn&apos;t anywhere as good as Google, Samsung, or most Chinese manufacturers at rolling out platform updates on time, and the device is unlikely to switch to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before the end of the year.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="nmH4423Uj3ZSmp5b9Katvi" name="motorola-edge-2024-vs-google-pixel-8a-back-01.jpg" alt="Motorola Edge 2024 vs. Google Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmH4423Uj3ZSmp5b9Katvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola did a lot of the right things with the Edge 2024; the phone has stellar battery life, a good OLED panel, lightweight design with thin bezels, and clean software. But the hardware is underwhelming to say the least — as are the cameras — and it won&apos;t get as many software updates. It costs $549, so you are shelling out $50 more than the retail price of the Pixel 8a.</p><p>Ultimately, the Pixel 8a is still the definitive choice in this category. It has a better design, brighter panel, much better hardware, outstanding cameras, and will get seven Android updates. Google continues to thermally constrain its devices, and that limits the Pixel 8a&apos;s potential as a gaming phone, but it still outshines the Edge 2024 in this regard. If you want to get a new mid-range phone in 2024, the Pixel 8a is still the best overall choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>While there is a lot to look forward to at the next Galaxy Unpacked event, which may feature the Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Buds 3 series, and Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. The Galaxy Tab S9 series was also released last year, although it is doubtful that their successor will be released this year. However, the first renders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Galaxy Tab S10</a> Ultra have appeared.</p><p>Together, Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Android Headlines</a> have come up with the first high-quality renders of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, the premium one in the trio of the tablet series. Right away, the Ultra tablet looks identical to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! Here comes your very first look at the #Samsung #GalaxyTabS10Ultra (360° video + 5K renders + dimensions)!On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/d7RG3W5APv pic.twitter.com/W3AVdLpruA<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1804523245137219702">June 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The publication further notes that it would measure approximately 326.4 x 208.6 x 5.45mm, wherein the previous iteration is 0.5mm thinner. Users expecting a major design refresh with the Tab S10 Ultra might have to wait for the successor, considering the new renders.</p><p>According to the tipster, the device will feature a large 14.6-inch display — still the largest available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> world. It sports a notch featuring dual cameras, and it is rightfully placed for landscape mode, which is considered the default mode for using the tablet for video calls.</p>

<p>Aside from these renders, little to no evidence has come up regarding the Tab S10 Ultra and its accompanying Tab S10 and S10 Plus models. That’s because the trio launch isn’t likely happening this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a>; instead, it will be happening early next year, notes the tipster. </p><p>Further, it still needs to be determined whether Samsung will opt for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 or the latest Snapdragon X Elite SoC; the latter might be the case if the Korean tech giant wants to take the tablet against the M4-based iPad Pro models. </p><p>The other expected specs from the upcoming Galaxy S10 Ultra include up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of onboard storage. The tablet will further feature quad speakers tuned by AKG. Lastly, it will also have S-Pen support, as seen on the predecessor.</p>

<p>It's pretty obvious that the Chromecast with Google TV is long overdue for an upgrade. While it still excels in certain areas, the reality is that it's almost impossible to justify the price tag compared to what you can get elsewhere. </p></p>

<p>One could argue that the streaming devices category has basically plateaued, and it would be a difficult argument to counter. Occasionally, we&apos;ll see a new device hit store shelves, as is the case with Walmart&apos;s Onn. streaming devices. This time around, we&apos;re comparing the new Onn. Google TV 4K Pro vs. Chromecast with Google TV (4K).</p><p>Both of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming devices</a> upgrade your existing setup with the Google TV interface and for the same price. But that&apos;s pretty much where the similarities stop.</p>
<h2 id="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-design-2">Onn. Google TV 4K Pro vs. Chromecast with Google TV (4K): Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RW8ZrWHwAypL7LnQN6pEcH" name="Chromecast-with-Google-TV-dongle-remote-and-box.jpeg" alt="Chromecast with Google TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RW8ZrWHwAypL7LnQN6pEcH.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the cost and the general experience are the same, there&apos;s nothing similar about the design. One of the biggest benefits of owning a Chromecast over the years is that it&apos;s small enough to toss in a bag and plug it right into any TV. This trend continues with the current iteration, as the Chromecast with Google TV remains one of the lightest and slimmest streaming devices out there.</p><p>Really, all you need to bring with you is the remote and a USB-C cable so that the Chromecast has power. Then, just plug it in, connect it to the internet, and let the streaming begin. You don&apos;t have to fiddle around with anything else, offering a level of convenience that remains among the best streaming devices.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">Onn. Google TV 4K Pro</a>, you might mistake this as a competitor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2022-review">Amazon Fire TV Cube</a>. Instead of being able to be hidden away behind the TV, the 4K Pro is a box complete with a proprietary barrel connector for power. It&apos;s not quite as elegant or as portable of a solution, but there&apos;s a good reason for that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DHb8bmdcZy5sUtAvGGAsRS" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review-1.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro on TV stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DHb8bmdcZy5sUtAvGGAsRS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 4K Pro itself is covered in a fabric-like material, akin to what you&apos;ll find on the Fire TV Cube and Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> speakers. There&apos;s also a button on the front, which serves an important purpose, in addition to ports on the back and a microphone toggle on the side.</p><p>Lastly, the remotes are somewhat similar, with a couple of caveats. Both Google and Walmart include shortcuts to different streaming services, such as YouTube and Netflix. With the 4K Pro remote, you also have shortcuts for Disney+ and Paramount+, along with a big "Free TV" button in the middle.</p><p>There are also dedicated Google Assistant buttons on either remote, but Walmart did something a bit unexpected. In the top right corner, there&apos;s a new "Favorites" button that can either be used to switch between your TV&apos;s inputs or quick-launch one of your most-used apps.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="USKvnNXChkJnYWLzAuoBcK" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-google-stadia-controller-2.jpg" alt="Google Stadia Controller next to the Onn Google TV 4K Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USKvnNXChkJnYWLzAuoBcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It&apos;s been almost four years since the Chromecast with Google TV debuted, and since then, Google hasn&apos;t done much besides release a 1080p version. This means that we&apos;re still limited to 2GB of RAM and 8GB of onboard storage with the Chromecast. Unfortunately, the only way to get any additional storage is to attach a USB-C dongle to the lone USB-C port on your Chromecast.</p><p>By comparison, the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is packed with 32GB of storage. When accounting for the operating system and built-in apps, this drops to around 25GB, which is still 3x as much as the Chromecast. But, it&apos;s much easier to add on extra storage thanks to the built-in USB-A port on the back.</p><p>On paper, the 4K Pro offers what seems to be a minor bump in performance. It&apos;s powered by the Amlogic S905X4, which is just a step above the Chromecast&apos;s Amlogic S905X3, paired with 3GB or 2GB of RAM, respectively. However, the overall experience is vastly different between the two, as we have yet to deal with any stutters or potential bottlenecks with the 4K Pro.</p>

<p>The same can&apos;t be said about the Chromecast, as it can feel like Google&apos;s attempt to give us a lesson in patience. Considering the minimal performance upgrades, a potential explanation could have to do with the limited onboard storage. Google backed itself into a corner and has yet to rectify the situation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="4uWKKp3Gwxm87sjterd4QH" name="onn-google-tv-4k-pro-ports.jpg" alt="Onn Google TV 4K Pro ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4uWKKp3Gwxm87sjterd4QH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro isn&apos;t as travel-friendly as the Chromecast, there&apos;s a pretty good reason for that. Instead of releasing a box with ports, the 4K Pro is also a smart speaker powered by Google Assistant. There are microphones and speakers built into the 4K Pro, letting you control your smart home, ask questions, or start a movie, without needing the remote.</p><p>That can come in particularly handy if you can&apos;t figure out whether your couch swallowed the remote. In that case, there&apos;s another trick that the Chromecast doesn&apos;t have, as the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is the first Google TV streaming device to sport a Remote Finder functionality. Just push the button on the front of the 4K Pro, and a sound will emit from your remote, so you know exactly which couch cushion to lift.</p>

<p>There&apos;s still a space in the market for something like the Chromecast. But, it&apos;s likely not the streaming box that you want to have at the center of your home theater setup. Instead, it&apos;s better suited for those times when you&apos;re traveling and don&apos;t want to deal with whatever nonsense the hotel tries to use. Even then, $50 is a lot to spend on something that primarily resides in your suitcase or travel bag.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is the better solution if you want a new streaming device at the center of your home theater setup. It costs exactly the same but is faster, has more storage, offers ports without needing a dongle, and the list goes on.</p><p>There are rumblings that an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast-with-google-tv-4k-successor-may-come-soon-new-remote">updated Chromecast</a> could be on the horizon, possibly launching this fall alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. However, we wouldn&apos;t hedge our bets on that until some type of official announcement is made. Until that happens, the Onn. Google TV 4K Pro is the one that we&apos;d recommend for pretty much everyone in the market for a new streaming device.</p>

<p>If any manufacturer gets the award for "most improved," it&apos;s OnePlus. The OnePlus 12 is the company&apos;s latest flagship phone and it lives up to the hype in basically every way possible. As Harish noted in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review#section-oneplus-12-software">OnePlus 12 review</a>, "it took OnePlus a decade, but it finally created a flagship without any noticeable drawbacks."</p><p>The overall design of the OnePlus 12 is similar to the OnePlus 11, but it still stands out when compared to just about any other phone on the market. In addition to being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">much more eye-friendly</a> than other OLED displays, OnePlus included what it calls the "Trinity Engine" that lets you push all games to 120Hz regardless of whether they support them or not. That&apos;s a huge upgrade from previous OnePlus phones which kept gaming locked at 60Hz.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inside the phone is plenty powerful and lets OnePlus not only push the boundaries of mobile performance but also improve battery life. Both Harish and I got two days on the average charge and, thanks to SuperVOOC 100W wired charging, it will only take a few minutes to top-up the battery and get another day of use. Plus, OnePlus includes that 100W charger in the box, and the phone also supports 50W wireless charging.</p><p>You&apos;ll also be impressed by the cameras which take genuinely good pictures and video in any lighting condition. They&apos;re not <em>quite</em> as good as the Hasselblad branding might suggest — the more expensive Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 8 Pro outclass it — but check out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-vs-oneplus-12-camera-review">OnePlus 12 camera review</a> to get an idea of what to expect.</p><p>The only real "downside" is that OnePlus is offering four major Android updates with one extra year of security updates, totaling five years of update promises. OnePlus hasn&apos;t always been as fast as Google or Samsung when it comes to updates, but five years of support is still excellent and ranks among the very best. Plus, even though Samsung and Google offer two extra years of software updates, OnePlus won&apos;t charge you nearly as much to get its latest phone.</p>

<p>I used the Nuu B30 Pro for several weeks and was regularly surprised that this phone could somehow cost under $300. An eye-friendly 120Hz AMOLED display uses 1920Hz PWM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq0zTAsNL0Y">at low brightness levels only</a>, making it feel great to look at in any light. The build features premium-looking curves and a snazzy teal color on the back that is wonderful to hold and use all day.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor is surprisingly speedy, especially when compared to anything else in this price range. Plus, 12GB of RAM means you&apos;ll never have trouble multitasking between apps, and the nearly bloat-free version of Android 13 ensures that the phone won&apos;t get slowed down by garbage apps you&apos;d need to uninstall right away.</p><p>Battery life was quite good and I had no trouble getting through a full day no matter how much I used it. OnePlus offers faster charging in this price segment but 30W is still faster than lots of other phones, including far more expensive ones from companies like Google and Samsung.</p><p>Plus, the camera is surprisingly excellent and blows phones like the Moto G 5G out of the water, even though those phones cost about the same amount of money. The only real downsides are lack of water and dust resistance and wireless charging.</p><p>Nuu promises 2 years of security and OS updates, which means this phone could potentially get Android 15 sometime in 2026. Two years of updates could be seen as a negative, but at less than $300, it&apos;s uncommon to find anything better.</p>

<p>If you want the best Android phone that Samsung has to offer right now, look no further than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This premium device boasts all of the efficiency and power found in the S23 Ultra with a few notable improvements.</p><p>This year, Samsung outfitted the frame with titanium and finally flattened the display. Couple that with the included S Pen and you have the best note-taking phone on the market. Plus, the display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">doubles the PWM rate</a> and adds an anti-glare filter for better long-term eye protection.</p><p>The Ultra features the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy Devices chipset, an exclusive version of the Qualcomm processor. This internal hardware gives your phone enough power to handle graphics-intensive gaming without totally annihilating your battery life or dropping in performance. Plus, it&apos;s got great new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features that work flawlessly with the included S Pen.</p><p>In most cases, the Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera is better than the Pixel 8 Pro, an achievement that&apos;s taken Samsung years to earn. But, as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-camera-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra camera review</a> shows, it still struggles to take clear pictures of moving subjects. That&apos;s particularly problematic for households with pets or kids.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the S24 Ultra&apos;s biggest flaws is its price. Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month">best Galaxy S24 Ultra deals</a> will help take the sting out just a bit.</p>

<p>It&apos;s been very difficult to choose between the OnePlus 12R and Google Pixel 8a for this particular segment. Both phones are simply amazing, and the price tags help sweeten the deal even further. But I chose the OnePlus 12R as the best for four reasons, specifically: a better display, better battery life, faster charging, and better performance.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;ve used the OnePlus 12R for a solid month and never once felt like I needed a more expensive phone. It does everything I need it to, yet doesn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m missing out on important features since the company&apos;s OxygenOS sports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/first-12-things-to-do-with-the-oneplus-12">same incredible features as that OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>The phone&apos;s camera regularly impresses me, even if it&apos;s not as good at taking photos of fast-moving objects — like kids and pets — as the Pixel 8a. If anything, that&apos;s the reason to choose a Pixel 8a over the OnePlus 12R if those types of photos are the most important thing for you. But the OnePlus 12R takes better portrait mode shots, captures better video, and has more camera features than the Pixel 8a.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor in the OnePlus 12R performs better than the Google Tensor G3 inside the Pixel 8a and it even has better battery life. Beyond that, the OnePlus 12R charges at a blazing 80W with the charger included in the box, so just 20 minutes of charging will fill your battery. Goodbye, battery anxiety!</p><p>Lastly, the OnePlus 12R&apos;s display is just plain better than what Google offers on the Pixel 8a. Not only is it a true LTPO display with 1-120Hz capability — the Pixel 8a can only shift between 60Hz and 120Hz — but it doesn&apos;t use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flickering</a> above 30% brightness. Even below that, it uses 2,160Hz PWM dimming, or 10x the rate of the Pixel 8a. That means even people with sensitive eyes, like myself, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">can comfortably use</a> the OnePlus 12R.</p>

<p>Like a few other flagships on this list, the Samsung Galaxy S24 isn’t a dramatic departure from its predecessor, but it’s a refinement of everything that made the latter phone great.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 boasts a compact 6.2-inch AMOLED 120Hz display and the lightweight-yet-premium device feel that we’ve come to expect from the S series. Not only does 2024&apos;s smaller Galaxy S phone feature the same powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor as its more expensive siblings, but it also comes packed with all those fantastic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features.</p><p>Samsung included the exact same 50MP primary camera, 12MP ultrawide camera, and 10MP 3x telephoto camera as the last two Galaxy S phones had, so don&apos;t expect any kind of upgrade in the camera department unless you&apos;re coming from something much older.</p><p>But, on the bright side, Samsung is now promising seven years of software updates for the Galaxy S24, so your phone will feel new even if you hold on to it for a long time.</p>

<p>Google makes some pretty good phones, but the best part of owning a Pixel is the camera.

Plus, the Pixel 8 Pro ships with a number of exclusive features like the Pro camera mode, making it easy to make manual adjustments with just a few taps.</p><p>Google&apos;s Tensor G3 also comes with a brand-new 7-year software update promise, meaning your Pixel 8 Pro will see major Android updates until 2030. That&apos;s a huge improvement over previous years and longer than almost any other Android phone. Plus, battery life has been exceptional and charging speeds are pretty snappy at 30W.</p><p>Google also made big leaps with hardware refinements this year, flattening the display (goodbye, curved glass) and rounding out the corners so the phone feels more comfortable to use.</p><p>And while Google&apos;s Tensor chipset is known for its AI processing prowess, it&apos;s not as good at anything else compared to Snapdragon chipsets.

<p>After years of refinements and improvements, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 feels like the perfect foldable for most people. Like the previous year, the Flip 5 features subtle improvements over its predecessor, but those improvements add up to something more than the sum of its parts.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing quite like snapping your phone closed when you&apos;re done with it. It sounds silly, but there&apos;s a certain psychological component to folding it up and putting it away.</p><p>The phone itself is more durable than ever, too, featuring an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both halves of the back. The phone&apos;s cover screen has seen a substantial boost in size compared to previous generations of Z Flip models. Plus, the inner pre-installed screen protector has been refined and features better adhesive than in previous years, hopefully keeping protectors from peeling off over the lifetime of the phone.</p><p>Samsung also packed in a nice 3,700mAh battery alongside the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, the same processor found in the Galaxy S23 series and the Z Fold 5.</p>

<p>Just like any piece of technology, smartphones evolve and change as time goes on. We&apos;ve seen screens get bigger, cameras get a lot more capable, and processors rival those found in computers. The next big thing for phones is the folding form factor, and so far, the best yet in this niche is the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The best way to think about the device is as a phone and tablet in one. When the OnePlus Open is closed, you&apos;re treated to a 6.31-inch 120Hz AMOLED display that you can use for anything you&apos;d like — checking email, scrolling through Twitter, watching YouTube videos, you name it. OnePlus made its outer display wider than Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Fold line and it makes everyday use so much nicer. Essentially, it feels like a "normal" phone when it&apos;s closed.</p><p>Then, when you need a tablet-sized screen, you just <em>open</em> up the OnePlus Open to reveal a gorgeous 7.82-inch AMOLED panel with 120Hz LTPO 3.0 tech. It&apos;s a lot like having an iPad Mini that you can fold up and take with you wherever you want, and if you ask us, that&apos;s pretty amazing. It&apos;s also a lot more eye-friendly than any of Samsung&apos;s foldable phones as it uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">higher PWM rate</a> and several eye-friendly enhancements, despite being a Samsung-made display.</p><p>And, unlike Samsung&apos;s foldables, the display crease on the OnePlus Open is barely noticeable. Plus, OnePlus equips its phone with better battery life <em>and</em> faster charging. That means you can go for much longer on a single charge and take a lot less time to top it up when it needs some juice.</p><p>OnePlus&apos; OxygenOS is super customized for the Open, as well. There&apos;s a taskbar on the bottom of the larger display, making it operate more like a tablet or laptop than a phone, and great multitasking features because of it. You can tap and drag any icon in the taskbar to perform split screen, or simply tapping an icon on the bar to open <em>any</em> app installed on your smartphone within one tap. Now that&apos;s multitasking at its best.</p><p>Plus, you can pick up the Oppo Pen if you&apos;d prefer to use a stylus. It&apos;s a little on the expensive side and the Pen isn&apos;t available on Amazon, but it&apos;s not too hard to find if you look around the web. And let&apos;s not forget the cutting-edge camera system which uses a <em>massive</em> sensor to achieve photo quality unlike any other foldable. It&apos;s so good, OnePlus is using it in the OnePlus 12, as well.</p>

<p>Nubia RedMagic phones were already our favorite gaming phones, and the RedMagic 9 Pro ups the game in substantial ways. First off, the actively-cooled Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor inside is an absolute beast, and the Red Core 2 co-processor only helps things further by ensuring the most responsive touch sampling rates on any phone in existence.</p><p>That bright and liquid-smooth 120Hz OLED display is also quite eye-friendly with a low flicker rate thanks to BOE&apos;s excellent technology. RedMagic bumped the battery size up by nearly 10% compared to the RedMagic 8, and fast charging speeds ensure that you&apos;ll be powered up in no time even if you forget to plug it in.</p><p>Plus, an actual <em>headphone jack</em> means you can use your favorite pair of lag-free wired headphones while gaming, and the pair of 50MP rear cameras do a good enough job of capturing all the Pokemon you&apos;ll be catching.</p><p>The under-display front-facing camera leaves a lot to be desired quality-wise, but since this is a gaming phone primarily, it makes sense for RedMagic to prioritize a way to completely hide that camera instead of leaving an ugly punch hole in your games.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the best Android phones?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>There are many contenders for the best Android phones, but we think the OnePlus 12 is the best option for most people. OnePlus has rebuilt Oxygen OS into something special and includes five years of promised updates to match. Excellent Hasselblad cameras on the back pair nicely with epic battery life, charging speed, and performance. Plus, the eye-friendly display is a joy to look at day or night.</p>
<p>If you have a few hundred more dollars to spend and want something even more impressive, the obvious choice is the Galaxy S24 Ultra. This phone is the successor of the outstanding S23 Ultra, featuring a flat screen and the best camera on any Samsung phone. Best of all, you get an integrated S Pen that lets you write notes, doodle, and so much more.</p>
<p>Folks looking for a compact phone with few or no compromises have a surprising amount of choices, which is a breath of fresh air compared to previous years. The Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8a are two of the best smaller phones you can get in the U.S., and folks who live outside of the U.S. and want a small phone would be remiss if they ignored the Asus Zenfone series. It's a compact phone with a blazing-fast processor, a huge battery, and a great camera. All things that aren't super common together in smaller phones, yet, Asus has figured out a way to deliver them all in one sleek package.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I pick the best Android phone?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Android phones have never been better than they are right now. So regardless of whether you can afford a flagship device or one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a>, you can go out and buy a phone that you'll be thoroughly happy with. Out of every single phone on the market, however, we have to give our top recommendation for the best Android phone to the OnePlus 12.</p>
<p>OnePlus's latest flagship has all the essentials you want, including a brilliant 120Hz AMOLED screen, powerful cameras that take great photos in any lighting, fast charging, reliable internal hardware that powers through even the most intense gaming sessions, and clean software with five years of guaranteed Android OS updates.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What size screen should I get for my Android phone?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>When buying a new Android phone, you should consider many different things, and it all starts with the display. This is the component you interact with more than anything else, so you must get one that you'll enjoy using. Things like the resolution and refresh rate of a screen are worth talking about, but more so is the size.</p>
<p>Smartphones come in different shapes and sizes, and the biggest determining factor for that is the display. A 6.8-inch screen results in a much larger phone than one with a 5.8-inch one, and because of that, you need to know how big or small you're willing to go.</p>
<p>Take the Galaxy S24 Ultra, for example. Of the "normal" phones on this list — that means a phone that doesn't fold in half — the S24 Ultra has the largest display and, therefore, is a phenomenal canvas for watching movies, playing games, and browsing the web.</p>
<p>Basically, any content consumption looks better on a larger display because the more room you have, the bigger and easier it is to see your media. The downside to this, however, is that phones like the S24 Ultra can be somewhat unwieldy. Especially if you're someone with smaller hands, managing a phone like that can be a pain — sometimes literally!</p>
<p>A phone like the OnePlus Open solves this problem a bit by giving you an even larger display that can fold in half. It's even got a world-class camera system that blew us away.</p>
<p>If you'd rather have a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">smaller-sized phone</a>, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Asus Zenfone 11 are phenomenal choices depending on what form factor you want. These are substantially easier to manage and can be used with one hand, but you have less room for your movies and games on the flip side. It also means you can fit less content on the screen at one time, and if you're someone who likes to increase your font size, things are easier to read, which could result in you having to do a lot of scrolling.</p>
<p>And, of course, there are plenty of phones that fall somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. If you're really concerned about whether or not a phone will be too big or small, your best bet is to honestly go hands-on with it yourself at your local carrier store or Best Buy before making your purchase.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Are software updates important?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>It's easy to compare displays, processors, and cameras, but something that's just as important to talk about is software updates. Android is constantly evolving and getting better, and while it's nice to get updates that keep your phone feeling fresh and new, security updates are far more important than feature updates.</p>
<p>Samsung and Google offer seven years of software updates for their phones — the most of any smartphone company today. OnePlus, OPPO, Xiaomi, and Vivo come in second place with four Android OS updates and one extra year of security updates for their flagship phones.</p>
<p>But the number of years supported doesn't paint the whole picture. Companies like OnePlus and Motorola often deliver bi-monthly security updates — so you'll get six security updates per year — while Samsung and Google often update every month. This isn't normally a big deal but could make a difference if you regularly use public hotspots or hotel Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Google also always updates its Pixel phones to the latest version of Android first, something that makes a lot of sense considering Google <em>makes</em> Android. The downside to this is that the Pixel can sometimes be a little <em>too</em> cutting-edge and has been known to introduce bugs into the experience from time to time.</p>
<p>Generally, the more you spend on a phone, the more often (and longer) it'll receive software updates. Most $200-300 Android phones will only receive one or two major software updates, while $1,000 phones will see five to seven years of updates.</p>
<p>So, how important is it that your phone gets software updates? That ultimately depends on how much you care about new Android features and how long you plan to use your phone. Google releases a new version of Android every year, and while these updates don't tend to be that drastic from year to year, they give your phone important features and security settings that help keep it running in tip-top shape for a long time.</p>
<p>If you keep your phone for years at a time — often five or more years — these updates will ensure that you can continue to use new apps. Over time, Google discontinues support for older versions of Android because it becomes too much of a problem for developers to test compatibility with older phones as well as newer ones.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I choose a smartphone camera?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Over the last couple of years, there's been a trend with certain phone companies to throw as many cameras onto their devices as possible. As it's become more common for phones to ship with two, three, or even four cameras, there's something of an expectation that phones have to have multiple camera sensors to be any good.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert — this isn't true.</p>
<p>Let's look at the Galaxy S24 Ultra. It has a 200MP primary camera, yet the Google Pixel 8 Pro with its 50MP main sensor tends to take better photos. The biggest difference lies in the software — Google's is best for capturing objects in motion like pets and kids — and the secondary lenses that add more abilities to a phone's camera.</p>
<p>And while having those extra camera sensors can be a lot of fun, it's only worthwhile if they're high-quality. Far too often, we see companies throw in a lot of extra cameras on their phones only to have these secondary lenses not be very good. But, of course, the primary camera sensor is always the most important, so that's the one you want to pay attention to the most. </p>
<p>There are so many other factors that come into play with phone cameras, so don't let the megapixel count be your only factor for judging them when you're out shopping. Read reviews, look at camera samples, and you'll have a much better understanding of what kind of camera you're dealing with.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What size should my phone's battery be?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Battery life isn't the most fun thing to talk about with smartphones, but ultimately, it's one of the most essential components. Your phone can have the best display and processor around, but if it's constantly dying throughout the day, what's the point?</p>
<p>There are many different battery capacities for all of the phones on this list, and if you don't regularly keep up with them, it can be challenging to know what a good size is and what isn't. So, here's a general rule of thumb. If you're buying an Android phone, the ideal capacity is 4,000mAh or larger. As phones move toward larger displays with faster refresh rates, more battery is needed to keep them powered throughout the day.</p>
<p>Of course, this can vary a bit depending on the type of phone you're buying. Phones with smaller screen sizes and lower display refresh rates can still get through a full day of use without a hitch because they generally draw less power than phones with more impressive specs. The best Android phones often have extremely fast charging speeds, and phones like the OnePlus 12 will get an entire day's worth of battery life in just a 20 minute charge.</p>
<p>These are factors you'll need to consider when shopping for your phone, but generally, more mAh means more battery life.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What other features should I look for in a smartphone?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Last but certainly not least, there are a few smaller features and specs that can be easy to overlook when doing your shopping — a prime example being NFC. NFC stands for Near Field Communication, and it's the chip in most phones that allows you to pay with your smartphone with Google Pay at grocery stores, restaurants, etc. All of the phones on this list support NFC, but many cheaper phones often lack the feature. You may not care about Google Pay, but if you do, it's worth double-checking that the phone you want to buy does have NFC.</p>
<p>Another spec to check for is an IP rating. This is a seal of protection many phones have, and it ensures they're protected from a certain amount of dust and water. So if you get caught outside in the rain or take your phone to the beach, a higher IP rating ensures that the phone should survive just fine. IP68 is the highest dust and water resistance rating, while cheaper phones might have something like IP53 which means some water and dust but not full submersion.</p>
<p>Some phones lack this IP rating yet boast water resistance or have a coating that gives them some protection. Those devices are also probably fine to get splashed with water here and there, but you don't have that same guaranteed protection. The best-case scenario is to avoid getting your phone wet whenever possible, but if you happen to be around the water a lot, it's probably worth getting something with that IP68 protection.</p>
<p>We should also address a trend going through the smartphone space for a few years now — the death of the headphone jack. The vast majority of new phones coming out these days no longer have the port, but few holdouts continue to offer it. It's certainly nice to have if you're someone who primarily uses wired headphones or earbuds, but if you've moved on to the wireless bandwagon, it's not something you need to be all that concerned with.</p>
<p>We know that's a lot to take in, but once you understand the kind of phone you're looking for and the budget you have to work with, we hope this guide makes you feel better equipped to make the right decision. There are so many good phones out there, and we wouldn't recommend one on this list if we didn't think you'd be happy with it. Happy shopping, and enjoy your new phone!</p></article></section>

<p>While you can control your smart home in various ways, no one wants to pull out their phone every time they turn a light on or off or scream across the house like a madman. After all, a smart home is about making things easier to do, not more convoluted, and nothing makes it easier than a smart display.</p><p>Shoring up the limitations of even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">best smart speakers</a>, a smart display&apos;s touchscreen can stream YouTube in the kitchen while you cook, activate your Alexa devices and routines, and effortlessly manage timers and alarms. The Nest Hub is (still) one of the best smart displays around, but if that doesn&apos;t catch your fancy — we have five other options that are also worth a look.</p>

<p>The second generation of Google&apos;s Nest Hub might already be three years old, but it&apos;s still the best smart display you can buy today. Its 7-inch touchscreen is amply bright for sunlit kitchens, and the 1024x600 pixel resolution may seem lackluster, but it&apos;s surprisingly crisp when watching YouTube or other videos on it.</p><p>The Ambient EQ light sensor allows the display&apos;s color temperature to automatically adjust based on the room&apos;s lighting, making it look almost like a picture frame at times. The Nest Hub sounds impressive, too, thanks to its full-range speaker that&apos;s great for both music playback and Google Assistant management.</p><p>Unlike most smart displays, which feature a camera for video calling purposes, Google swapped that out for a Soli sensor, which you might not recognize unless you were a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> fan. Soli sensors can recognize proximity without needing visual input, allowing them to track your sleep quality without pointing a camera at your bed. </p><p>If you do want a camera on a Nest Hub and a larger display, the Nest Hub Max is still available, though it&apos;s a bit long in the tooth. When considering the entire package on the Nest Hub, it not only qualifies as an excellent smart display, but it&apos;s also one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-google-assistant-speakers">best Google Assistant speakers</a> — period.</p>

<p>Not content to be the Goldilocks of Amazon&apos;s Echo Show lineup, the Echo Show 8 should perfectly fit almost any buyer who isn&apos;t steeped in the Google ecosystem. It sits right in the middle between the Echo Show 10 and Show 5, giving you a near-perfect balance of features and form while also saving you some money.</p><p><em>"Wait, how is the display that&apos;s $50 more the &apos;best budget&apos; option?"</em> The Echo Show 8 is more frequently discounted than every other smart display on this list combined, so it&apos;s often the same (if not lower) price as Google&apos;s while sporting a larger screen and newer, upgraded specs. </p><p>The eponymous 8-inch screen allows you to easily view content while remaining small enough to fit nicely in just about any room. The resolution is also excellent for the size, making everything nice and crisp without driving up the price too much.</p><p>The speakers are just as impressive, with the Show 8 touting two 2-inch speakers that kick out 10W per channel. You won&apos;t find Dolby processing like you get on the more expensive Echo Show 10 above, but it still sounds plenty good for music, podcasts, and TV shows. </p><p>Rounding out the whole experience are all your usual Alexa voice commands, a 13MP camera with auto-framing for video chats — or using your Show 8 as a security camera while out and about — and a physical shutter to cover it when not in use.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no denying how great the Nest Hub is, but if you prefer Alexa over Google Assistant, the third-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-review">Echo Show 10</a> may be a better fit. This is Amazon&apos;s flagship smart display, and it&apos;s a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>As its name implies, the Echo Show 10 has an excellent 10.1-inch HD display that makes everything from movies to YouTube videos look phenomenal. The Echo Show&apos;s speakers are also top-notch and if you ask us, sound far better than the Nest Hub Max&apos;s. They&apos;re loud, clear, and kick out an insane amount of bass. So whether you&apos;re listening to a podcast or the latest album from your favorite band, these speakers will do your content justice every single time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Echo Show benefits from exquisite build quality, an easy set-up process, and a camera for video calls. With the latest model, the display can even rotate on its base to follow you around the room, always giving you the best angle possible.</p><p>Amazon&apos;s touchscreen interface for its smart displays doesn&apos;t feel as elegant or well-integrated as Google&apos;s does, but for anyone in Camp Alexa, this is the smart display to get.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not 100% sold on the usefulness or style of a smart speaker, dip your toes in the proverbial pool with a pint-sized package that can either blend in or stand out in the best way. From answering your Ring doorbell to acting as a security camera itself, from queuing up all the lights to setting off a full-on dance party, the Echo Show 5 is like Ginger Rogers. It does everything the Echo Show 8 or 10 can backward and in (tiny) high heels.</p><p>Amid a sea of boring black or white smart speakers and displays, the Echo Show 5 actually has a cool Cloud Blue color option this generation — two, if you count the nebula-patterned Show 5 Kids. Its 5.5-inch screen will seem small to many, but this rotund and rounded little smart display displays timers, relay the news, and play both movies and music when your niece demands to hear Moana sing How Far I&apos;ll Go for the 1,945th time.</p><p>And that soundtrack will sound surprisingly bold, too, as the Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) not only swapped in a speaker with beefier bass and voluptuous volume, it flipped it upside down. Now, your music will blast upwards rather than being broadcast face down into your mahogany nightstand. (What a concept!!)</p><p>You might be wondering why you&apos;d want the Show 5 for $90 when the Echo Show 8 drops to that price every other week, but it just fits into your home and your life in ways that the largest displays just can&apos;t. Be it filling the gap between your desktop monitor and the keyboard, perching on an hallway shelf, or sitting front and center on your kitchen counter, the Show 5 checks all the smart display boxes without disrupting your natural flow. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is the newest of Google’s three smart displays. Well, it’s not <em>just</em> a smart display — it&apos;s a standalone Android tablet that doubles as one — but that’s primarily how Google designed and marketed it. You can pick it up, use all your favorite apps and games, and then set it back on its magnetic speaker dock to charge and crank up your music.</p><p>The magnetism on the dock can take a bit of time to find the right amount of force needed to break the magnetic grip without jerking the base around. Once you do, though, the convenience of just tossing it back on the dock once you&apos;re done doomscrolling or YouTube bingeing sparks such joy. </p><p>Smart displays have long touted their video calling features, but being stuck in one location while you do it can be a drag. The Pixel Tablet not only allows you to move around the house while you talk to the grandkids over Google Meet, but it also sports much better cameras on both its front and back.</p><p>The Tensor G2 powering this array is fine for casual gaming and browsing, but it&apos;s by no means made for power users or hardcore gamers. Given that it&apos;s a Pixel, you&apos;ll get the monthly updates and quarterly feature drops for new features until at least Android 16 and patched security bugs for a few more years after that. </p><p>If the tablet/dock scenario is just too clunky for you, there is a 10-inch Nest Hub Max out there. However, I’m loathe to recommend a five-year-old smart display unless you’re after sound quality. The Nest Hub Max’s audio quality is miles ahead of the Pixel Tablet’s speaker dock.</p>

<p>While smart displays can stream your favorite TV shows or play your music, you probably already have a big screen TV and sound bar for all your audio needs. If you&apos;re strictly interested in the Alexa smart home aspect of a smart display or want to save counter space, Amazon&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-echo-hub-review">Echo Hub</a> is here for your no-nonsense needs.</p><p>Like this Pixel Tablet, this is technically not a smart display — it&apos;s a smart home control panel — but the Echo Hub can take your smart home from "neat but annoying" to "this actually feels like the future" with its drop-dead easy interface. The home screen is extra-customizable with its widgets, favorite device groups, and shortcuts to your routines. </p><p>With support for Zigbee, Matter, and Thread, the Echo Hub is the only smart hub you should need for all of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">favorite smart devices</a>. While it can&apos;t preview third-party cameras, you can use it to peek in on your Ring doorbells and cameras. It can still summon your music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more through Alexa, but the speakers here are smaller than the Echo Show 8 to make it sleeker when mounted. </p><p>For the privacy-minded folks, there&apos;s no camera on this smart display, and it is the only smart display that you could reasonably use with the mics muted all the time. Since you can set it up with access to all your smart devices, you can turn it into essentially an easy-to-read, wall-mounted remote. Speaking of, you don&apos;t have to mount the Echo Hub, but its $30 table stand is sold separately.</p>
<ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3>
<p>For most device types, you have many factors to consider, from usage to location to specialized specifications. Blessedly, things are much simpler for smart displays: you pick an ecosystem and then a size. You technically can use both Alexa and Assistant in the same home, but you must suffer the agony of setting up every single device, routine, and room twice.</p><p>While you might decide to switch platforms for a better variety or upgrade frequency — or maybe you’re just fed up with the issues on one platform or the other — most of us will elect to remain in our chosen ponds. For Google Assistant/Home users, that leaves you with three choices; Alexa users get five (technically six). </p><p>Size will mostly be dictated by the intended landing pad for your display, but please take two factors into consideration regarding the screen size you opt for. Don’t underestimate how readable a smart display can be across a room for glanceable info like a timer’s duration, the temperature outside, or someone at your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa">swanky smart doorbell</a>. </p><p>While you certainly won’t be making out the blades of grass on a soccer pitch, an Echo Show 5/8 and the 7-inch Nest Hub will hold up perfectly fine in the vast majority of rooms. There’s no need to move up to the Echo Show 10 unless you’re obsessed with audio quality or will be putting it somewhere the rotating display will actually help—like the corner of your bar between the kitchen and living room. </p><p>If you’re after a smart display specifically for smart home control, I’d recommend the Echo Hub only if you’re intending to mount it somewhere. The Echo Show 8 offers much better audio otherwise. Similarly, the Google Pixel Tablet is a tablet that doubles as a smart display, so the experience there can be a bit clunkier than desired, but for your dad&apos;s smart lights and mom&apos;s match-three games, it could fit perfectly. </p>
<h2 id="is-now-a-good-time-to-buy-a-smart-display-xa0-2">Is now a good time to buy a smart display? </h2>
<p>Since smart displays don’t get yearly refreshes like smartphones, the only reason you&apos;d wait to buy one is an imminent shopping holiday. From the now quarterly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2024-dates-early-deals-and-what-to-expect-from-the-sale">Amazon Prime Day events</a> to traditional sales holidays like Memorial Day and Black Friday, deep discounts on Amazon’s Echo Show lineup are never more than a few weeks away. Google&apos;s Nest Hubs — like Nest cameras — don&apos;t see deals nearly as often, but its list price is the price that the Echo Show 8 drops to during most of its sales, so </p><p>The majority of Amazon&apos;s Echo Show line was refreshed in 2023, so we&apos;re not expecting new models until next year at the earliest. The Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen) came out in 2021, and the 2019-debuted Nest Hub Max is 5 years old. However, we&apos;re not expecting new versions of either one anytime soon since the tablet/smart display hybrid Pixel Tablet arrived in 2023.</p>
