<ul><li>Motorola confirmed through a teaser on X that it will launch its next Razr foldables on June 25 in the U.S.</li><li>The teaser is vague in terms of design changes, however, it seems there are several color options en route like orange, blue, pink, and more.</li><li>Previous rumors have suggested Motorola will increase its cover display sizes for both devices while keeping the price tags the same as in 2023.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It&apos;s an exciting time for Motorola foldable enjoyers as the company confirms they&apos;re on the way—and quite soon, too.</p><p>Motorola posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MotorolaUS/status/1802702833768079662">a quick video</a> on X, confirming that its next wave of foldables will launch on June 25 in the U.S. Unfortunately, Moto doesn&apos;t give us a clear view of the design of its Razr devices in the short teaser. What&apos;s easily discernable is that one variant (at least) will feature orange and blue colorways.</p><p>It also seems as though a vegan leather backing is to be expected on the devices.</p><p>The teaser continues, briefly showing several more colorways for its 2024 Razr phones, such as pink and maybe a cafe-brown option.</p><p>The good news is that we&apos;re only a week (and a day) away from seeing the Razr and Razr Plus 2024 in totality.</p>

Some flip-worthy news is coming... pic.twitter.com/NioPU69hLQ<a href="https://twitter.com/MotorolaUS/status/1802702833768079662">June 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>It should be noted that Motorola put its higher-priced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus</a> on the shelves <em>before </em>the cheaper Motorola Razr 2023 hit the market later in the year. It&apos;s unclear if the company will follow the same trend again this year or if consumers can grab both devices simultaneously, as that would be a quick turnaround for the more affordable variant.</p><p>Regardless, there&apos;s been some rumors that suggest Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-ultra-price-configuration-leak">might not increase</a> the prices of its Razr foldables. It was discovered through a European listing that the Razr Plus could see a €1200 price tag, which is similar to its predecessor. Moreover, the device could get a larger RAM/storage option for the same price, with rumors suggesting a 12GB+512GB configuration.</p><p>Other news suggests Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-50-series-renders-reveal-cover-screen-changes">is going all in</a> on the bigger cover screens by boosting its Plus variant to 4 inches and giving its base model a larger 3.6-inch cover. The latter is the same size as the cover display on the 2023 Razr Plus.</p><p>The Plus variant is expected to debut with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, a 165Hz refresh rate on its cover display, and a 6.9-inch OLED internal screen. The base Razr model could see MediaTek&apos;s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a> series chip with a 4,200mAh battery.</p>

Although there are plenty of offers available to everyone, many of the best deals are exclusive to Plus members. If you aren't a member yet, you can sign up today and enjoy nearly all of the benefits without paying a cent for a full 30 days. After the trial period wraps up, you can either cancel your subscription or pay $12.95 per month (or $98 for an annual plan).

<p>In addition to exclusive deal access, Walmart Plus memberships come with loads of great incentives, including free shipping on all orders (no minimum), free delivery from your local Walmart store, and a free subscription to the streaming service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a> (on the Essential Plan). </p><p>Drivers with a Walmart Plus membership will also enjoy free tire repair and discounts on gas at over 13,000 participating locations. Walmart Plus also tends to offer some limited-time benefits that come and go. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/plus"><strong>sign up today</strong></a> and you&apos;ll get five months of Apple Music or three months of YouTube Premium at no additional cost.  </p>
<h2 id="how-much-is-a-walmart-plus-membership-xa0-2">How much is a Walmart Plus membership? </h2>
<p>Walmart Plus memberships start at $12.95 per month, or you can pay $98 for a full year in advance. That drops the price of your membership to only $8.17 per month. Like we mentioned above, if you&apos;re still on the fence about the subscription service, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/plus"><strong>sign up for a Walmart Plus free trial</strong></a> and enjoy nearly all of the benefits of the membership for a full month at no cost to you. Keep in mind that Walmart&apos;s "Exclusive Access" benefits are only available to full members after the trial period wraps up. </p>

<h2 id="do-cell-phones-cause-cancer-2">Do cell phones cause cancer?</h2>

<p>Anonymous asks:</p><p><em><strong>Does using a cell phone increase the chance of cancer? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh boy, it&apos;s that time again. This question comes up every once in a while after some paper or publication questions the link between phone use and cancer rates. I&apos;ve seen a recent one implying that a particular brand of phone is more dangerous because it emits radiation and ignores it. You should, too, because there are a few glaring errors, like incorrectly listing what doctors and governing bodies call a safe amount. But it is a valid question and worth discussing once one bogus claim is tossed aside.</p><p>Because I always front-load the basic answer, I&apos;ll defer to the FCC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns">which states</a>:</p><p>"<em>According to the FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO), among other organizations, to date, there is no consistent or credible scientific evidence of health problems caused by the exposure to radio frequency energy emitted by cell phones.</em>"</p>
<p>As usual, though, the simple answer doesn&apos;t say it all. Nobody is saying there is <em>no</em> definite link between using a phone and cancer because it&apos;s impossible to know. What people at the CDC or WHO <em>do</em> know is that studies show the number of people who develop an illness has no evidence that phone use caused it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Cell phones</a> communicate with other devices, like cell towers or Wi-Fi routers, using RF (Radio Frequency) waves. The frequency of these waves is about the same as over-the-air broadcast television or the low setting of a microwave oven. They&apos;re also non-ionizing, which is really important in this discussion.</p>
<p>Non-ionizing radiation is everywhere at a much greater frequency than your phone emits because visible light is everywhere. If you have enough light to see or there is enough light to feel the heat, you&apos;re awash in non-ionizing radiation.</p><p>This type of radiation does not emit enough energy to damage human DNA and cause cancer like higher-frequency UV rays or X-rays can. At an extreme level, RF waves can heat human tissue, but your phone is incapable of producing this much energy. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUKsEdBmrSg55YXgoRQ9pe" name="sunshine.JPG" alt="Sunshine at the Natural History Museum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUKsEdBmrSg55YXgoRQ9pe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3264" height="1836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These are things science knows. Indisputable facts if you will. Using this knowledge we can say that using a phone is no more dangerous than being in the path of a television signal or being inside under a bright lamp. It&apos;s far less dangerous than being outside in the sun with no UV protection, which is a known cause of cancer.</p><p>The good news is that concern for our safety doesn&apos;t stop there. The amount of RF emission from a phone is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-is-fcc-certification-necessary">tested and regulated</a> before you can buy one.</p>
<p>Cell phone RF is measured as SAR, which stands for the Specific Absorption Rate, which is the amount of radiation absorbed by the body. Your phone gives off radiation that your body will absorb, and phone makers have to limit the amount to meet standards.</p><p>Different countries and governing bodies have different regulations, but in the U.S., the FCC lists the maximum limit of SAR as 1.6 watts per kilogram of body weight. A phone can&apos;t emit more than this amount under any conditions.</p>
<p>As the FCC notes, these tests can be misleading. A phone&apos;s listed SAR value is when the phone is operating for an extended period under its highest possible power. Your phone will never work this hard. A better, more accurate SAR value would be based on variables that can&apos;t be tested, so the FCC goes with the worst-case scenario.</p><p>For practical purposes, this means a phone with a lower listed maximum SAR rating could perform worse than one with a higher listing in your hand under certain conditions. Remember this when you look at lists saying which phones are "safest" based on SAR ratings.</p>
<p>This is what science knows and has tested, but there is still more work to be done. Cell phone usage is a relatively new phenomenon. We don&apos;t have hundreds of years of historical data to compare, so we need to keep looking. Currently, nobody can find an actual link between phone use and cancer—but that doesn&apos;t mean nobody ever will.</p><p>If you want to be safe, nobody will fault you. Use the speakerphone or text instead of making a call. In the meantime, know that almost everything you see linking illness and phone use doesn&apos;t jibe with what the experts and scientists who study it every day have to say on the matter.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another round of leaks is surfacing regarding Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra&apos;s potential design and price tag.</p><p>The leaks stem from X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Tim_tom_0/status/1802152272123548140">Tim Tom</a>, who posted an alleged snapshot of the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in white and black colorways (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/17/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-price-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). From the renderings, it seems Samsung is moving toward a squarish body with a circular watch face atop that.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Watch Ultra white version pic.twitter.com/OSJbscGkIA<a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_tom_0/status/1802259273092665546">June 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>The right side of the device seems to offer three buttons with the center-most one colored orange and metallic silver on its face. The purpose of these buttons is unclear. These could likely open the app&apos;s menu and other options like previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watches</a>.</p><p>This new centered orange button <em>could </em>rotate, letting users scroll through their app menu or adjust media volume. With such uncertainty, it&apos;ll be worth waiting until Samsung&apos;s full reveal of the watch.</p><p>The leaks continue with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-watch-ultra-us-prices-colours-revealed/">91Mobiles</a> reportedly obtaining information about Samsung&apos;s potential price plan for the Watch 7 Ultra. The publication&apos;s unnamed source states the device could cost anywhere between $699 and $710. These prices refer to the watch&apos;s 47mm size variant.</p><p>Leaked renders from X double down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-renders-leak">on previous images</a>, showing the device with that squarish body and circular face. There was a third circular button present in those photos, too. However, it was colored like the rest of the watch&apos;s body. Those rumors also said the Watch 7 Ultra could be slightly bigger than the Watch 6 Classic with the following dimensions: 47 x 47.14 x 16.4mm.</p><p>What&apos;s exciting is that Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-gets-launch-date">upcoming countdown animation</a> for this summer&apos;s Unpacked event appeared. From the snapshot, it seems the Korean OEM is preparing for its event on July 10 at 10 PM Korean Standard Time (KST).</p>

<ul><li>Earlier this week, Qualcomm quietly launched the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 mobile platform, which sounds like an entirely new chip.</li><li>It is not, as Qualcomm confirmed that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 695.</li><li>If Qualcomm isn’t innovating enough in the low-end of the chipmaking market, competitors like MediaTek could pull ahead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm subtly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-6s-gen-3">added a new mobile processor to its website</a> earlier this week on Monday, June 10 — the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3. This chip continues a trend of Qualcomm naming processors in a way that is confusing at best or intentionally misleading at worst. It might sound like an upgrade over the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip, but it isn’t. In fact, it’s a downgrade because the “new” Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 processor is essentially a rebranded version of the Snapdragon 695. </p><p>There were glaring similarities between the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 and the Snapdragon 695, but there are a few things about the former chip that are new. Qualcomm cleared up the speculation with a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-6s-gen-3-not-new-3451623/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which confirmed that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 isn’t <em>really</em> a new chip. </p><p>“Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is an enhanced version of Snapdragon 695 delivering improved CPU, GPU, and AI performances (sic),” the company said.</p><p>Before this was made clear, it already seemed like the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 was yet another rebranded version of the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3, which was first released in 2021. For starters, the beginning of the model number of the former (SM6375-AC) is identical to that of the latter (SM6375). Both chips also used the 6nm manufacturing node, which is an older process. We’ve already seen 3nm mobile chips come out, and the 6nm process is far from cutting edge in 2024. </p><p>With that being said, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 does have a few clear advantages over the Snapdragon 695. The ”enhanced” version of the chip has a higher CPU and GPU clock speed, potentially making for faster performance. Qualcomm also says that there is support for “AI performances,” but we really don’t know what that means. It’s unlikely that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 will be able to deliver the kinds of modern on-device AI features that we see on stronger platforms, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or the Tensor G3. </p><p>These minor improvements can’t change the fact that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is built on the exact same architecture as the Snapdragon 695, and there’s only so much Qualcomm can do to pull more performance out of it. This creates a situation where new devices with a “new” processor are potentially starting three years behind competing devices.  </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:547px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.36%;"><img id="4aWSUTFtpiQJz7hixGjY2b" name="Snapdragon 8 Gen 3_9.png" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4aWSUTFtpiQJz7hixGjY2b.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="547" height="363" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s disappointing that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is nothing new, because we know Qualcomm can do better. This isn’t like the dark days at Intel, where the entire company was struggling to improve its chipmaking and fabrication technologies across its portfolio. Qualcomm is doing better than ever, and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Snapdragon X platforms are giving Apple a run for its money for the first time in a long while. </p><p>Qualcomm clearly focuses on the money-makers, and it’s not hard to see why. The company has had essentially a monopoly on the flagship Android mobile processor space for a while, even after Google moved to its own Tensor processors. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> doesn’t come close to matching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip</a>, so any buyer worried about performance will choose a Qualcomm-powered phone. That’s without even getting into the grip Qualcomm has on wireless modems.</p><p>The company is breaking into the laptop and desktop markets with the Snapdragon X platform, which is powering a solid lineup of new Windows laptops set for release this week. Qualcomm is the <em>only</em> company making a chip that will be compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebook-plus-competing-with-copilot-plus">Microsoft’s Copilot+ feature set</a> at launch. It already announced plans to bring Snapdragon X to more form factors, starting with a Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC. </p><p>This is why it’s a shame that the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 is just a 2021 chip with a few tweaks. No one is expecting Qualcomm to make its budget chips competitive with flagship ones, but the company can certainly do more than rebadging three-year-old processors.</p>
<h2 id="qualcomm-would-be-making-a-mistake-by-becoming-complacent-2">Qualcomm would be making a mistake by becoming complacent</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="jgLzFa9pQnHRAjve3JQ6wH" name="mediatek-sign.jpg" alt="Mediatek Logo next to a building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgLzFa9pQnHRAjve3JQ6wH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Intel got complacent, AMD was right there to swoop in and capture some market share. Now, the “team red” and “team blue” race is back on in full swing. The same thing could happen in the smartphone chipmaking industry if Qualcomm keeps re-releasing chips without any new innovation. Qualcomm isn’t the only company making mobile processors, and it’s facing real competition, especially in the low end of the market.</p><p>MediaTek has the potential to one-up Qualcomm in the budget market, especially if its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-benchmarks-vs-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">latest chips</a> indicate what it can do. The company has been teasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android device</a> powered by a MediaTek processor, which would be huge for the company. MediaTek seems to have the chops to compete with Qualcomm industry-wide, but it can definitely do so in the budget sector if Qualcomm keeps releasing ”new” chips like the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3.</p>

<p>Recent new evidence indicated that Samsung&apos;s next Galaxy foldable launch is heading for an early July release this year. Several other Galaxy products are in the pipeline and are expected to launch alongside the foldable. Interestingly, most of them are now listed on Samsung&apos;s wearable app before launch.</p><p>Samsung has a Galaxy Wearable app showing all its compatible devices for Galaxy phones. An X user, Rydah, shared a leaked screenshot (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-buds-3-leak-3451132/">Android Authority</a>) of the app that shows all the latest and upcoming Galaxy devices. </p>

<p>The list comprises the recently released first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">budget smartwatch</a> from Samsung, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-launch">Galaxy Watch FE</a>. It is accompanied by the soon-to-be-launched Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro. Next to them is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>; interestingly, there is no rumored Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra model. The most awaited fitness tracker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a>, is also present on the list.</p><p>The other devices in the list include the currently available ones like Galaxy Fit 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-review">Buds 2 Pro</a>, amongst others. </p><p>The interesting thing about the list isn&apos;t the device models but rather the iconography accompanying them. They reveal the device&apos;s design, and the exciting new change appears to be that of the Galaxy Buds 3 and the Buds 3 Pro; unlike the predecessors, which feature a rounded earbud design, the Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro come with a new stem design similar to what we have seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/airpods-pro-review">Apple AirPods Pro</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung released the Galaxy S24 series early this year, and its toned-down Fan Edition renders have just surfaced.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 FE resembles the flagship siblings’ design aesthetics, including the color options.</li><li>The device is expected to ship with Exynos 2400 under the hood, while the U.S. model is likely to sport Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It’s been six months since the Galaxy S24 series took off, and another set of Galaxy foldables is on for July. However, another popular handset from Samsung is still in the pipeline — the affordable Galaxy S24 FE, which is now shown in leaked renders.</p><p>Samsung traditionally launches a toned-down version of its flagship series every year. This year’s Galaxy S24 FE is no different, according to the leaked renders from tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks), who shared them via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-first-look-revealed-via-5k-renders-360-video/">Giznext</a>. At first glance, it looks similar to what we saw on the duo of Galaxy S24 models early this year. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad! Finally, here comes your very first look at the #Samsung #GalaxyS24FE (360° video + crispy sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @GizNext 👉🏻 https://t.co/eZy8FYdRmI pic.twitter.com/kDeSi1GIxF<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1801854920192045447">June 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>On the front, the device equips an Infinity-O display with minimal bezels and a slightly noticeable chin at the bottom. The renders showcase a triple camera setup stacked vertically on the back. The Galaxy S24 FE carries the volume rockers and the power button on the right pane of the device.</p><p>Hemmerstoffer further reveals the expected specifications of the Galaxy S24 FE, including a 6.65-inch AMOLED display and the device approximately measuring 162mm x 77.3mm x 8mm. Underneath, the upcoming Fan Edition will likely feature the Exynos 2400 SoC, also seen in Galaxy S24 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a> models in regions except the U.S. The device with the same chipset has recently hit the benchmark test (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-fe-spotted-geekbench/">SamMobile</a>), scoring 2047 single points and 6289 multi-core points.</p>

<p>The benchmark test further confirmed the device features 8GB of RAM and runs Android 14, presumably with One UI 6.1 on top of it. OnLeaks, however, indicated that the device would go with up to 12GB of RAM aided by 256GB of onboard storage, and for the U.S., Galaxy S24 FE might still equip the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> chipset. As for optics, the device will likely host a 50MP primary camera from the Galaxy S24 series aided by telephoto and ultra-wide angle lens.</p><p>Going by its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 FE will likely hit the market sometime in the fall of this year. However, Samsung needs to rework the pricing for the upcoming Fan Edition, as the previous model received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s23-fe-launches-in-india-but-you-shouldnt-buy-it-heres-what-to-get-instead">some flack</a> for the value it was offering despite being a toned-down version of the flagship.</p>

<ul><li>The COROS DURA solar GPS bike computer is on sale June 17 for $249 and ships July 1.</li><li>It has a 2.7-inch MIP touchscreen with digital dial and back/lap button, IP67 resistance, and dual-frequency GPS tracking.</li><li>It lasts 120 hours in GPS mode or 70 hours in dual-frequency mode, and recharges 2 hours of GPS per 1 hour of direct sunlight.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>COROS made its name as an affordable running watch alternative to Garmin. Now it&apos;s releasing its first-ever bike computer, the COROS DURA, with a very similar approach: high-end specs, budget price.</p><p>Like the popular Garmin Edge bike computers, the COROS DURA is a water-resistant, backlit LCD device mounted to your bike handlebar that can display offline GPX maps, turn-by-turn navigation, upcoming climbs, and checkpoints for mid-route guidance.</p><p>Its 2.7-inch, 480x240 MIP display can last an epic 70–120 hours depending on whether you use GPS only or multi-band GPS, and that&apos;s before the solar recharge. For comparison, the high-end Garmin Edge 1040 Solar only lasts 50 hours in dual-band mode with solar.</p><p>Meanwhile, bike computers closer to the DURA in price — like the Wahoo Bolt or Garmin Edge 530 — typically only last about 20 hours per charge.</p>

<p>Aside from GPS, the COROS DURA has an altimeter, compass, temp sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope, and it connects via Bluetooth or ANT+; the latter helps it sync with e-bikes and smart trainers.</p><p>The COROS DURA tracks your training load and fitness level, though you&apos;ll want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a> or watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">PACE 3</a> to sync heart rate data. It also displays your workouts or training plans and has an FTP Test.</p>

<p>The COROS DURA uses a standard quarter-turn mount that comes in the box. It works in conditions between -20ºC/ -4ºF and 60ºC/ 140ºF. It comes with six main activity modes: road, indoor, gravel, MTB, E-bike, and E-MTB.</p><p>As the COROS DURA is its first bike computer, plenty of common features and integrations remain works in progress. COROS says it plans to add Strava Live Segments, "Ride with GPS" app compatibility, music playback controls, Zwift integration, and other software updates down the line. </p><p>COROS says it designed the DURA with input from "some of the world&apos;s best off-road endurance cyclists" and that it&apos;s been tested in real-life endurance races like the Unbound 200. The name Dura means "a hard thing" in Spanish, which COROS says is meant to represent the bike computer supporting you during hard rides. </p><p>Android Central has a DURA review unit and intends to test out its reliability over the coming months. So far, we&apos;re simply excited by its affordability and longevity. Its price is well below the cheapest Garmin Edge and closely matches the Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt v2, while its solar-powered battery life is well above the competition. Time will tell if serious cyclists will gravitate towards it, but it certainly has the essentials for anyone considering buying a bike computer for the first time. </p><p>You can pre-order the COROS DURA now before its July 1 ship date at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coros.com/dura">COROS&apos; site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is rumored to feature a 4,000mAh battery, up from the Z Flip 5's 3,700mAh.</li><li>The main camera will apparently a big boost to 50MP, while the secondary camera stays at 12MP and the front camera at 10MP.</li><li>Samsung's next clamshell foldable model will presumably be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, though RAM details are not yet disclosed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We&apos;ve heard unofficial details about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Z Fold 6</a>, with Samsung expected to reveal them next month. But ahead of the possible July 10 event, a leaked spec sheet for the Z Flip 6 gives us a comprehensive look at Samsung&apos;s next clamshell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-just-got-spoiled-hard-in-this-massive-leak">revealing the full specs for the Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> a few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-specs-revealed-ahead-of-unveiling-at-paris-unpacked/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a> has dropped what might be a roadmap for the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If this leak is legit, it looks like Samsung is aiming to make big improvements in several important areas for the new foldable.</p><p>The leaked specs show a big upgrade in battery life for the Z Flip 6, addressing a common complaint from consumers. It&apos;s rumored to pack a 4,000mAh battery, a nice jump from the 3,700mAh one in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>Besides the battery, the leaked information hints at a major boost in camera quality. The Z Flip 6 is rumored to have a 50MP main sensor, a big step up from the last model.</p><p>Even though the main sensor seems to be getting a big upgrade, the rest of the camera setup appears to stick with the Z Flip 5&apos;s configuration.</p><p>Driving the Z Flip 6’s performance inside is likely to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> processor. The leak doesn&apos;t mention the RAM size, but it&apos;s safe to assume Samsung will pair this powerful processor with enough RAM to ensure smooth performance.</p><p>Meanwhile, the leaked specs show that many features are similar to those of the Z Flip 5. This means the next-generation model may sport a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED main display with a 2640 x 1080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The cover display also apparently stays the same at 3.4 inches with Super AMOLED tech and a 720 x 748 resolution. Although there&apos;s no confirmation of a resolution upgrade, we might see better peak brightness for the cover display.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting parts of the leak is that the Z Flip 6 might keep the same dimensions and weight as the Z Flip 5. If true, this would be an impressive engineering achievement, especially with the bigger battery.</p><p>The leaked specs highlight impressive upgrades in battery life, camera quality, processing power, and AI integration for the Z Flip 6. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-and-flip-6-leak-reveals-some-disappointing-news-about-their-us-pricing">potential price increase adds some complexity</a>. It’s still unclear if these enhancements will win over consumers and justify the higher cost Samsung might be planning.</p>

<ul><li>The Logitech MX Ink is a 6DoF mixed-reality stylus for $129 shipping at Meta Connect 2024.</li><li>The stylus works for both 2D drawing on an "MX Mat" or 3D roomscale design.</li><li>It comes with the Mat, an "Inkwell" for charging, and a replacement nib.</li></ul>
<p>3D design is a popular use case for virtual or mixed reality, but you usually have to use a bulky controller or your hands to design in XR. The Logitech MX Ink stylus for the Meta Quest 3 and 2 will change that, giving you a more reliable controller for the most popular VR art apps.</p><p>Announced on Monday, the Logitech MX Ink is described as having a "familiar pen-like feel, pressure-sensitive tip, and main button" that "let you sketch, grab, and manipulate in MR."</p><p>The MX Ink "seamlessly transitions from 2D to 3D spaces," says Logitech Head of AR/VR Vadim Kogan, with "the tracking accuracy expected by Meta Quest users in MR." Logitech and Meta collaborated on the stylus&apos; development to ensure it worked with both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-review">Quest 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> — though not the productivity-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Quest Pro</a>, surprisingly. </p><p>Logitech says it&apos;s "the first time Meta Quest headsets support more than two paired controllers at once." Once you pair the pen, you&apos;ll be able to drop your Touch controllers to sketch and take notes without having to switch inputs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKb6Rv4ptJQ7Xqax5foGyW" name="Logitech-MX-Ink-lifestyle-photo-1.jpeg" alt="Photo of a person wearing a Meta Quest 3 and using the Logitech MX Ink stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKb6Rv4ptJQ7Xqax5foGyW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Logitech)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Starting at $129, the Logitech MX Ink will have two optional accessories. The MX Mat is a "friction-free drawing environment" that you can essentially use as a real-world canvas while painting in VR. And the MX Inkwell is a charging base for storing and topping off your stylus, though you can always use a simple USB-C cable.</p><p>Logitech says the Logitech MX Ink will ship around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-connect-2024-dates-announced-quest-3s-expected">Meta Connect 2024</a> on September 25. Meta is expected to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-lite">Quest 3S</a> at the event, and Logitech says the MX Ink will work with "future headsets."</p><p>Once it launches, the MX Ink will work with most popular XR art apps on Quest:</p>
<ul><li>Adobe Substance Modeler</li><li>Gravity Sketch</li><li>PaintingVR</li><li>Arkio</li><li>Engage</li><li>OpenBrush</li><li>GestureVR</li><li>ShapesXR</li><li>Elucis by RealizeMedical</li></ul>
<p>Logitech&apos;s announcement encourages "developers interested in integrating MX Ink with their applications" to use their GitHub page or apply for a dev kit, so I&apos;d assume this list will grow before September arrives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eF6npq4XPC3TZmk6vL8YdW" name="Logitech-MX-Ink-lifestyle-photo-2.jpeg" alt="Photo of a person wearing a Meta Quest 3 and using the Logitech MX Ink stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eF6npq4XPC3TZmk6vL8YdW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Logitech)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before this announcement, we wouldn&apos;t have guessed that the Meta Quest would be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a> with stylus controller support. Despite Apple having its Pencil (2nd Gen) and Pencil Pro available for iPads, it has yet to bring stylus support to the Apple Vision Pro. That dev-focused headset would certainly benefit from more fine control options. </p><p>Compared to an Apple Pencil, the Logitech MX Ink has similar perks like haptic feedback and a double-tap function, but it weighs about 8g more and is significantly thicker. We assume this can be attributed to the 6DoF tracking sensors.</p>
